1,The Rolling Stones,Angie,1973,"Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But, Angie, Angie

You can't say we never tried

Angie, you're beautiful, yeah
But ain't it time we said goodbye?

Angie,
I still love you

Remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close

Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie

Where will it lead us from here?

Oh, Angie, don't you weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But, Angie, Angie

Ain't it time we said goodbye, yeah?
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But, Angie, I still love you, baby
Everywhere I look, I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on, baby, dry your eyes
But, Angie, Angie
Ain't it good to be alive?
Angie, Angie
They can't say we never tried"
2,Tony Orlando & Dawn,Tie a Yellow Ribbon 'round the Old Oak Tree,1973,"I'm comin' home, I've done my time
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
If you received my letter telling you I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me
If you still want me
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
It's been three long years
Do ya still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree
Bus driver, please look for me
'cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
You know, I'm really still in prison
And my love, she holds the key
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free
I wrote, I told her please
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree
It's been three long years
Do ya still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
If I don't see that yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
Now the whole damned bus is cheerin'
And I can't believe I see
A hundred yellow ribbons round the old oak tree
I'm comin' home
(Tie a ribbon round the old oak tree)"
3,Roberta Flack,Killing Me Softly With His Song,1973,"Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me

He was strong in my face
Yeah he was seeing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song"
4,Carly Simon,You're So Vain,1973,"Son of a gun
You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror as you watched yourself gavotte
And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner they'd be your partner and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you

You're so vain (you're so vain)
I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you don't you?

You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive
Well you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee clouds in my coffee and
You're so vain

You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)

I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you don't you don't you?
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee clouds in my coffee and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you

You're so vain (you're so vain)
I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you don't you?

Well I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your lear jet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not you're with some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend wife of a close friend and
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (so vain)
I bet you think this song is about you
Don't you don't you don't you?
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
Probably think this song about you
You're so vain"
5,Elton John,Crocodile Rock,1973,"I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well 'Crocodile Rocking' is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy Mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the 'Crocodile Rocking' was out of the sight

La, la la la
La la la
La la la

But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Well 'Crocodile Rocking' is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy Mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the 'Crocodile Rocking' was out of the sight

La, la la la
La la la

6,Lobo,I'd Love You to Want Me,1973,"When I saw you standing there
I'bout fell off my chair
And when you moved your mouth to speak
I felt the blood go to my feet

Now, it took time for me to know
What you tried so not to show
Something in my soul just cried
I see the want in your blue eyes

Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be

You told yourself years ago
You'd never let your feelings show
The obligation that you made
For the title that they gave

Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you

7,The Sweet,The Ballroom Blitz,1973,"Are you ready Steve? Uh-huh
Andy? Yeah
Mick? Okay
Alright fellas - let's go!

Oh it's been getting so hard
Living with the things you do to me
My dreams are getting so strange
I'd like to tell you everything I see

Oh, I see a man in the back as a matter of fact
His eyes were as red as the sun
And the girl in the corner that no one ignores
Cause she thinks she's the passionate one

Oh Yeah! It was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah
And the man in the back said everyone attack
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said boy I want to warn you
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz

Oh reaching out for something
Touching nothing's all I ever do
Oh I softly call you over
When you appear there's nothing left of you

And the man in the back is ready to crack
As he raises his hands to the sky
And the girl in the corner is everyone's mourner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye

Oh Yeah! It was electric
So frantically hectic
And the band started leaving
Cause they all stopped breathing

Oh Yeah! It was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving

It's it's a ballroom blitz
It's it's a ballroom blitz
It's it's a ballroom blitz
Yeah, it's a ballroom blitz"
8,Elton John,Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,1973,"When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man

You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road"
9,Stevie Wonder,Superstition,1973,We do not have the lyrics for Superstition yet.
10,Gilbert O'Sullivan,Get Down,1973,"Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more
Get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog, baby
But I still want you 'round

You give me the creeps
When you jump on your feet
So get down, get down, get down
Keep your hands to yourself
I'm strictly out of bounds

Once upon a time I drank a little wine
Was as happy as could be, happy as could be
Now I'm just like a cat on a hot tin roof
Baby what do you think you're doin' to me

Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more
So get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog, baby

But I still want you 'round, around
I still want you around, aye, aye, aye

I don't give a damn
And I'd like you if you can to
Get down, get down, get down
You're bad dog, baby
But I still want you 'round

Once upon a time I drank a little wine
Was as happy as could be, happy as could be
Now I'm just like a cat on a hot tin roof
Baby, what do you think you're doin' to me

Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more
So get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog, baby
But I still want you 'round, around"
11,Ringo Starr,Photograph,1973,"Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realize you're not coming back anymore

I thought I'd make it the day you went away
But I can't make it 'til you come home again to stay

I can't get used to living here
While my heart is broke, my tears I cry for you
I want you here to have and hold
As the years go by, and we grow old and grey

Now you're expecting me to live without you
But that's not something that I'm looking forward to

I can't get used to living here
While my heart is broke, my tears I cry for you
I want you here to have and hold
As the years go by, and we grow old and grey

Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realize you're not coming back anymore
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
All I've got is a photograph
And I realize you're not coming back anymore
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph"

A Song For You
Top Of The World
Such a feelin's comin' over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky
Got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear
It's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world"

Waiting they played i'd sing along

Those were such happy times

And not so long ago

How i wondered where they'd gone

But they're back again

Just like a long lost friend

All the songs i loved so well

Every wo-wo-wo

Still shines

Every shing-a-ling-a-ling

So fine



When they get to the part

Where he's breakin' her heart

It can really make me cry

Just like before

It's yesterday once more



Lookin' back on how it was

In years gone by

And the good times that i had

Makes today seem rather sad

So much has changed



It was songs of love that

I would sing to then

And i'd memorize each word

Those old melodies

Still sound so good to me

As they melt the years away



Repeat (*)



All my best memories

Come back clearly to me

Some can even make me cry

Just like before

It's yesterday once more

Why don't we cross the bridge together
And find a place that's safe and warm?

Only with love can we climb
It's not too late, not while we're living

He was pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
Swiss time was running out

It seemed that we would lose the race, now

Promised her he'd take her for his bride

Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' to get over tryin' to get over

Was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream
What does it mean? He wouldn't know

Let's get high (*whispered in background 2 times*)

(B-Real)
I flow rhymes off just like weed in your chest
Think you got endo, hold your breath
Spittin on the track with Red and Meth
Holdin up a fat, when you smoke a cassette
Or CDs, we bees the ones with the Ouija's
Spread it on the arm, come on believe me
Look who it is, it's the funky feel
Smokin assassin from Cypress Hill
We think she's just resonated?
Fillin my brain till it's saturated
When you get the crushed weed and cultivate it
Give it to the hoes who love to hate it
Cause blunts get filled like Hershey Highways
I don't give a fuck who sits where I blaze
Chillin at the rainbow high and faded
You saving that bump(?), then isolate it

(Method Man)
Is there a Doctor in the house?
We like fuck that, nut sacks in your mouth
Lemme show you what a thug about
We can talk or we can slug it out
Better yet, you can bark like a bitch when I thug it out
There it is, a better a kid, ahead of his
Time to settle this, like men
I'm pipin hot, exciting
Right in the gym or hype in them, alright then
All day I drink and smoke
Shell toe with ankles in ya both
Cent, five cents, ten cents, dollar
Rocwilder blend the track and getting hotter
Ask your boy, now pass your boy something to smoke
Cause you have had nothing to throat, swallow
Bang the track, bring your bat
Ain't too many that can hang with that
So why bother

(Chorus)
Cisco Kid was a friend of mine
Hell yea
Cisco Kid was a friend of mine
Hell yea
He drank whiskey, Pancho drank the wine
Hell yea
He drank whiskey, Pancho drank the wine
Hell yea

(Cypress Hill)
Yea, send all, and fall back
And who wrote on this track
I don't really give a fuck
Put the pen down lets toss them up
Soul assassins, Latin thugs
Whole damn world know about us
Rhymes we kick and weed we pour
Get tus vatos all fucked up
And sing along to my get high song
Had you choking off of four foot bong
Cypress Hill and weed, can't go wrong
Keep you smoking like Cheech and Chong

(Redman)
Yo, call me that Doctor
P-Funk or chronic blower
Pussy smoker, strap toker, back broker
Hash burns in your pull out sofa
This is my brain on drugs
Move out my way 'cause, cause I might run you over
Bitches bounce your titties
I bounce with a pump shotgun
Look out, the highest man in the world
Walkin off with my hand on your girl
Can't drink and can't stand in the world
Niggas, two puffs and then pass me the L
What you talking about I'm not high enough to start that party
Triple beater enter the stage with a gauge
Don't shoot nobody
What you ain't high enough?
Do I gotta jump out there and tie you up?
Strap a bomb to your mouth
Till you wired up
Till the Park Ranger call the Firetruck
And said? Hey motherfucker, what you be smoking on?
I said? Hey motherfucker, why do you want some?
Yo, yo, give me the gun, we don't need to fight
Hold that blunt, I'll give you a light
Don't no nigga want to die tonight
With all this weed, get high tonight. BITCH!

She never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk, Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights, I know she'll be leaving with me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors

My baby makes me smile, Lord don't she make me smile
She's never too far away or too tired to say ""I want you""
She's always a lady, just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights, she's still a baby to me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors

46,Albert Hammond,Free Electric Band,1973,"My father is a doctor, he's a family man
My mother works for charity whenever she can
They're both good clean Americans who abide by the law
And they both stick up for liberty and they both support the war
My happiness was paid for when they laid their money down
For summers in a summer camp and winters in the tow

My future in the system was talked about and planned
But I gave it up for music and the free electric band

I went to school in hand-washed shirts with neatly ordered hair
And the school was big and newly built and filled with light and air
And the teacher taught us values that we had to learn to keep
And he clipped the ear of many idle kid who went to sleep
Then my father organized for me a college in the east
But I went to California, the sunshine and the beach

My parents and my lecturers could never understand
Why I gave it up for music and the free electric band

Well, they used to sit and speculate upon their son's career
A lawyer or a doctor or a civil engineer

Just give me bread and water, put a guitar in my hand
'Cause all I need is music and the free electric band

My father sent me money, and I spent it very fast
On a girl I met in Berkeley in a social science class
Yes, and we learnt about her body, but her mind we didn't know
Until deep rooted attitudes and morals began to show
She wanted to get married even though she never said
But I knew her well enough by now to see inside her head

She'd settle for suburbia and a little patch of land
So I gave her up for music and the free electric band"
47,Paul Simon,Kodachrome,1973,"When I think back on all the crap I've learned in high school

Kodachrome, they give us those nice bright colors
Gives those greens of summers
They make you think that all the world's a sunny day

Well I've got a, a Nikon camera
I love to take photographs
So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away

If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
Brought them all together for one night
They never matched my sweet imagination
And everything looks better in black and white

Does a ton-up on his sleigh
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

Are you waiting for the family to arrive
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside
Does your granny always tell you
That the old songs are the best
Then she's up and rock 'n' rolling with the rest

So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

What did your daddy do
When he saw your momma kissing Santa
Aaah ah aaah aahh

Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall
Do you ride on down the hillside
On a buggy you have made
When you land upon your head
And you've been 'Slade'

So here it is merry christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now

Heaven knows it's only me
That I'm decieving

When it comes to saying good-bye
That's a simple word that I just cannot say

There can be no way
There can be no way
This can have a happy ending
No, no
So we just go on
Hurting and pretending
Convincing ourselves to give it just one more try

Because neither one of us
Neither one of us wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us wants to be the first to say

83,Shirley Bassey,Never Never Never,1973,"I'd like to run away from you
But if you never found me I would die
I'd like to break the chains you put around me
But I know I never will

You stay away and all I do
Is wonder why the hell I wait for you
But when did common sense prevail
For lovers when we know it never will

Impossible to live with you
But I know, I could never live without you
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

You never treat me like you should
So what's the good of loving as I do
Although you always laugh at love
Nothing else would be good enough for you

Impossible to live with you
But I know, I could never live without you
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

You make me laugh, you make me cry
You make me live, you make me die for you
You make me sing, you make me sad
You make me glad, you make me mad for you

I love you, I hate you, love you, hate you
But I'll want you till the world stops turning
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

I love you, hate you, love you, hate you
But I'll want you till the world stops turning
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

I love you, hate you, love you, hate you
But I'll want you till the world stops turning
For whatever you do

88,Thin Lizzy,Whisky in the Jar,1973,"As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money, he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand or deliver or the devil he may take ya

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Wait for my daddy-o
Wait for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she'd love me, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Wait for my daddy-o
Wait for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' my Molly with me and I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Wait for my daddy-o
Wait for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'
And some men like to hear a cannon ball a roarin'
Me I like sleepin' specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

89,10CC,Rubber Bullets,1973,"I went to a party at the local county jail
All the cons were dancing and the band began to wail
But the guys were indiscreet
They were brawling in the street
At the local dance at the local county jail

Well the band were playing and the booze began to flow
But the sound came over on the police car radio
Down at precinct 49
Having a tear-gas of a time
Sergeant Baker got a call from the Governor of the county jail

Load up, load up, load up
With rubber bullets
Load up, load up, load up
With rubber bullets

I love to hear those convicts squeal
It's a shame these slugs ain't real
But we can't have dancin' at the local county jail

Sergeant Baker and his men made a bee-line for the jail
And for miles around you could hear the sirens wail
There's a rumor goin' 'round death row
That a fuse is gonna blow
At the local hop at the local county jail

Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?

Sergeant Baker started talkin' with a bullhorn in his hand
He was cool, he was clear, he was always in command
He said ""Blood will flow here Padre
Padre you talk to your boys
Trust in me God will come to set you free""

Well we don't understand why you called in the national guard
When uncle Sam is the one who belongs in the exercise yard
We all got balls and brains
But some's got balls and chains
At the local dance at the local county jail

Load up, load up, load up
With rubber bullets
Load up, load up, load up
With rubber bullets

Is it really such a crime
For a guy to spend his time
At the local dance at the local county jail?
At the local dance at the local county jail

Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?"
