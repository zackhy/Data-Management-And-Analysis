1,Blondie,Heart of Glass,1979,"Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between 'what I find is pleasing' and 'I'm feeling fine'
Love is so confusing
There's no peace of mind if I fear I'm losing you
It's just no good, you teasing like you do

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside adorable illusion
And I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using
Please don't push me aside
We coulda made it cruising, yeah

Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out was a pain the ass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa"
2,Chic,Le Freak,1979,"Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out!
Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out!

Have you heard about the new dance craze?
Listen to us, I'm sure you'll be amazed
Big fun to be had by everyone
It's up to you, it surely can be done

Young and old are doing it, I'm told
Just one try and you too will be sold
It's called 'Le Freak', they're doing it night and day
Allow us, we'll show you the way

Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out!

All that pressure got you down
Has your head been spinning all around?
Feel the rhythm, check the rhyme
Come on along and have a real good time

Like the days of Stomping at the Savoy
Now we ""freak,"" oh, what a joy
Just come on down to the 54
Find your spot out on the floor

Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out!

Now freak
I said freak
Now freak

All that pressure got you down
Has your head been spinning all around?
Feel the rhythm, check the rhyme
Come on along and have a real good time

Like the days of Stomping at the Savoy
Now we ""freak,"" oh, what a joy
Just come on down to the 54
Find your spot out on the floor

3,Gloria Gaynor,I Will Survive,1979,"At first, I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking, I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking, how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one, who tried to break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh

Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one, who tried to break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive"
4,Bee Gees,Tragedy,1979,"Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time in a world of tears I slowly drown
Goin' home I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holdin' you, holdin' you
Lovin' you, lovin' you

Tragedy when the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy when the morning cries and you don't know why?
It's hard to bear with no one to love you you're goin' nowhere

Tragedy when you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy when the morning cries and you don't know why?
It's hard to bear with no one beside you you're goin' nowhere

Night and day there's burnin' down inside of me
Oh, burnin' love with a yearnin' that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
I really should be holdin' you, holdin' you
Lovin' you, lovin' you

Tragedy when the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy when the morning cries and you don't know why?
It's hard to bear with no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere

Tragedy when you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy when the morning cries and you don't know why?
It's hard to bear with no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere, oh

Tragedy when the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy when the morning cries and you don't know why?
It's hard to bear with no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere

Tragedy when you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy when the morning cries and you don't know why?
It's hard to bear with no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere

Oh tragedy when the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy when the morning cries and you don't know why?
It's hard to bear with no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere

Tragedy when you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy when the morning cries and you don't know why?
It's hard to bear with no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere

Oh, tragedy when the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy when the morning cries and you don't know why?
It's hard to bear with no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere"
5,Donna Summer,Hot Stuff,1979,"Sittin' here, eatin' my heart out, waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'

Wanna bring a wild man back home
Gotta have some hot love, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight

8,Bee Gees,Too Much Heaven,1979,"Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Ooh, you and me, girl
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more

And, my love
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

You and me, girl
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry

You're my life
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing, oh
When you are to me
The light above

Made for all to see
Our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore

It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Love is such a beautiful thing

Oh, you make my world a summer day

9,Anita Ward,Ring My Bell,1979,"I'm glad you're home
Well, did you really miss me?
I guess you did by the look in your eye (look in your eye, look in your eye)
Well lay back and relax while I put away the dishes
Then you and me can rock a bell

You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell
You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell

Tonight was made for me and you

10,Rod Stewart,Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?,1979,"Sugar, sugar

She sits alone waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so, tell me so, baby

He's acting shy, looking for an answer
Come on honey, let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother

They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on honey, tell me so
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar, let me know

His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got this girl home
Relax baby, now we are alone

They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singin'
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinkin'
Outside it's cold, misty and it's rainin'
They got each other, neither one's complainin'

He say's, ""I sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind sugar we can watch the early movie""

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on honey, tell me so

Sugar

If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really, really, really, really need me
Just let me know, just reach out and touch me

If you really want me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know

If you, if you, if you really need me, just come on and tell me so
Just reach out and tell me so"

Rewritten by machine and new technology
and now I understand the problems you can see

We hear the playback and it seems so long ago

Regret the moment that I let you go
Our quarrel was such a way of learning so much
I know now that I love you

Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And, sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey

Came back to life just when I got your call
I wished I could climb right through the telephone line
And give you what you want
So you will still be mine, hey, hey

I can't go cheating, honey, I can't play
I found it very hard to stay away
As we reminisce on precious moments like this
I'm glad we're back together

It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring
Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah but the horns, they blowing that sound
Way on down south, way on down south, London town
You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing
And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole
Creole
And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home""
Then he makes it fast with one more thing
""We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing"""

A miracle oh it was beautiful magical
And all the birds in the trees well they'd be singing so happily
Oh joyfully oh playfully watching me
But then they send me away teach me how to be sensible
Logical oh responsible practical

And then they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
Clinical oh intellectual cynical
There are times... when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep for such a simple man...
Won't you please... please tell me what we've learned?
I know it sounds absurd but please tell me who I am...

I say now watch what you say they'll be calling you a radical liberal oh fanatical criminal
Won't you sign up your name
We'd like to feel you're acceptable respectable oh presentable a vegetable
Oh, ch-ch-check it out yeah

At night when all the world's asleep
The questions run so deep for such a simple man...
Won't you please oh won't you tell me please tell me what we've learned?
Any minuteI know it sounds absurd but please tell me who I am...

I never said I was a victim of circumstance 
I still belong 
Don't get me wrong 
And you can speak your mind 
But not on my time

Floating out on the tide
Following the river of death downstream?

A strange glow in the sky
And nobody seems to know where you go
And what does it mean?
Oh, is it a dream?

Bright eyes
Burning like fire.
Bright eyes
How can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes.

Is it a kind of shadow
Reaching into the night
Wandering over the hills unseen
Or is it a dream?

There's a high wind in the trees
A cold sound in the air
And nobody ever knows when you go
And where do you start
Oh, into the dark.

Bright eyes
burning like fire.
Bright eyes
how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard
(You know it's hard, you know it gets so hard)
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
(You watch your friends, you better watch your friends)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
(Never ends, you know it never ends)
You know that is crazy and you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint-hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
(Watch her eyes, baby watch her eyes)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies
(Keep lookin' for lies, baby keep lookin' for eyes)
'Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
(You watch your friends, you better watch your friends)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
(Never ends, you know it never ends)

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes

39,Abba,Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight),1979,"Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see no one in sight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me, you said you never needed me
I wonder if you need me now

We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me

Remembering the pain if I must say
It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all
I do love you still

Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can't put aside
For what we had, sometimes I tried to understand
But it's so heavy on the mind

So many dreams that flew away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm
Where did we go?
Where'd we go?

We lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all
I do love you still

We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me

'Cause I needed you so desperately
We were too blind to see
But then most of all
I do love you

Not to sing but I found one, I know
We are not alone, we feel an unseen love
We are sons and heirs of grace, we are children of
A light that never dims, a love that never dies
Keep your chin up child and wipe the tears from your eyes
In sleep we saw ourselves
A million years we had been waiting there it seems
While someone weaves a spell
A million stars look on in witness to our dreams, I know

58,Charlie Daniels Band,The Devil Went Down to Georgia,1979,"The Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal.
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot.
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""

""I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too.
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you.
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due.
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.""

The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin,
But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard.
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards.
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold,
But if you lose the devil gets your soul.

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow.
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss.
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this.

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, ""Well, you're pretty good ol' son,
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""

""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough.
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no.

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet.
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again,
'Cause I've told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.""
And he played:

""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough.

No one gave you a chance in the Spain of those days
On the walls every place they had put up the face of El Lute
And he robbed where he could just like once Robin Hood
They finally caught him and that seemed the end
But they caught him in vain 'cause a change came for Spain and El Lute

He had only seen the dark side of life the man they called El Lute
And he wanted a home just like you and like me
In a country where all would be free
And then freedom really came to his land and also to El Lute
Now he walks in the light of a sunny new day the man they called El Lute"
69,The Commodores,Sail On,1979,"Sail on down the line
Bout a half a mile or so
And don't really wanna know
Where you're going

Maybe once or twice you see
Time after time I tried to
To hold on to what we got
But now you're going

And I don't mind about the
Things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name
Yeah, yeah

Yes, I'll be on my way
I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along
I'm looking for a good time

Sail on down the line
Ain't it funny how the time can go
Friends say they told me so
But it doesn't matter

It was plain to see that
A small town boy like me
Just wasn't your cup of tea
I was wishful thinking

I gave you my heart and
I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away
Yeah, yeah

I've thrown away the blues
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time
Good time, yeah

Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good

Sail on, sugar
Good times never felt so good"

Doctor, doctor give me the news
I've got a bad case of lovin' you
No pill's gonna cure my ill

72,Kenny Rogers,She Believes (In Me),1979,"While she lays sleeping
I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes, all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home
All alone

While she lays dreaming
I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says, ""How was your night?""
And I come to her and say, ""It was all right""
And I hold her tight

And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday, if she was my girl
I could change the world with my little songs
I was wrong

But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe, on some special night
If my song is right, I will find a way
Find a way

While she lays waiting
I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend
And there's no end

While she lays crying
I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God, her love is true

And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday, if she was my girl
I could change the world with my little songs
I was wrong

But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe, on some special night
If my song is right, I will find a way
While she waits, while she waits for me"
73,Blondie,Dreaming,1979,"When I met you in the restaurant
You could tell I was no debutante
You asked me what's my pleasure, a movie or a measure
I'll have a cup of tea

And tell you all my dreaming, dreaming is free
Dreaming, dreaming is free

I don't want to live on charity
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?
Reel to reel is living rarity, people stop and stare at me
We just walk on by, we just keep on dreaming

Feet feet, walking a two mile
Meet meet, meet me at the turnstile
I never met him, I'll never forget him

Dream dream, even for a little while
Dream dream, filling up an idle hour
Fade away, radiate

I sit by and watch the river flow
I sit by and watch the traffic go
Imagine something of your very own
Something you can have and hold
I'd build a road in gold

Just to have some dreaming, dreaming is free
Dreaming, dreaming is free
Dreaming, dreaming is free
Dreaming is free"

You're the one who takes me higher
Ooh baby, set my heart of fire

Come on baby, lay your love on me
Ooh baby, let your love go free now
Come on baby, lay your love on me
Baby, baby, baby, got the love I need now

Now when I'm not tasting your sweet lips

Ooh darling, I know what I miss
You give me more than I could ever take
With every word and every move you make now

I can't believe that after all this time
I got everything I ever hoped to find
What ever you got I can't get enough
And it's you baby, it's you that I love

Come on baby, lay your love on me
Ooh baby, let your love go free now
Come on baby, lay your love on me

I knew that it wasn't my thing

Oh man, how can I describe, the way I feel
Fuckin' great man
Ok, let me see
How could I begin

[Verse 1:]
Locked in mariahs wine cellar all I had for lunch,
Was red wine more red wine and some captain crunch,
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch,
And to soak it up and in between snack, crack ers to munch
Mariah what ever happened to us
Why did we have to break up
All I asked for was a glass of punch
Ya see I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's
Going through your mind after such
A nasty break up with that latin hunk
Luis migul
Nick cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin I want her back ya punk
This is hello kitty bed spread satin funk
Mixed with egyptian with a little rap and punk
Zapp and eric clapton
Shaft, prince, abba, crunk
Ya baby
I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
man I really want you bad you cunt
Nick you had your fun
I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
Cause I'm gone

Bagpipes from baghdad
I run the streets and act like a mad man holding a glad...

[Verse 2:]
You could be a permanent fixture
In my lyrical mixture
I'm the miracle whip trickster
My signature sound
When a tube of lipsticks around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant
Wow man what an ensemble
What an assortment of pharma-
Ceuticals this beautiful pill does to my palm and
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut you like dahmer
Pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword boy
I'm like the fucking red sonja
Get it stuck in ya cornea
Nice knowing ya norman
Your so fucking annoying
Drop the shovel boy
You don't know what the fuck your doing
I ain't playing no fucking more
Nick cannon you prick I wish you luck with the fuckin whore
Every minute there's a sucker born
Snuck up on malachai
Made the motherfucker suck on shuck of corn
Chaka chaka khan chaka khan
Hit jason in the face with a hockey puck and
Told him it's fuckin on
Now what the fuck are you doing
Your running over the snow blower with the lawn mower blowing your bagpipes from baghdad

In a bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they'll become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molesting you
Titty-fucking you 'till your breast nipples flesh tickle my testicles
It's what they said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going, girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I've just got my one year sobriety chip
When the bad get going how bad is it gonna get
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with each other
Especially when they're joined at the hip
I'm going to get a needle thread sewing kit

82,Billy Joel,Honesty,1979,"If you search for tenderness 
it isn't hard to find. 
You can have the love you need to live. 
But if you look for truthfulness 
You might just as well be blind. 
It always seems to be so hard to give. 

Honesty is such a lonely word. 
Everyone is so untrue. 
Honesty is hardly ever heard. 
And mostly what I need from you. 

I can always find someone 
to say they sympathize. 
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve. 
But I don't want some pretty face 
to tell me pretty lies. 
All I want is someone to believe. 

Honesty is such a lonely word. 
Everyone is so untrue. 
Honesty is hardly ever heard. 
And mostly what I need from you. 

I can find a lover. 
I can find a friend. 
I can have security until the bitter end. 
Anyone can comfort me 
with promises again. 
I know, I know. 

When I'm deep inside of me 
don't be too concerned. 
I won't as for nothin' while I'm gone. 
But when I want sincerity 
tell me where else can I turn. 
Because you're the one I depend upon. 

Honesty is such a lonely word. 
Everyone is so untrue. 
Honesty is hardly ever heard. 
And mostly what I need from you."

London calling to the imitation zone
Forget it, brother, you can go it alone
London calling upon the zombies of death
Quit holding out and draw another breath
London calling and I don't wanna shout
But when we were talking I saw you nodding out
London calling see we ain't got no highs
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes

The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in
Engines stop running and the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error but I have no fear
London is drowning and I, I live by the river

Now get this
London calling yes I was there too
An' you know what they said? Well some of it was true
London calling at the top of the dial
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?

I never felt so much a'like a'like a'like"

It always turns out good
Every time I've held you
I thought you understood
People say a love like ours
Will surely pass
But I know a love like ours
Will last and last

But maybe I was wrong
Not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong
In knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)
And every time I think of you
Every time
Every time I think of you
Every single time
It always turns out good

Seasons come and seasons go
But our love will never die
Let me hold you darling
So you won't cry
Cause people say that our love affair
Will never last
But we know a love like ours
Will never pass

91,Suzi Quatro,She's in Love With You,1979,"Suzi Quatro -:- She's in love with you

She's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around
'Coz she's in love with you

So if you see her all alone one night walk up to her discreetly, ask her why
And if she replies with words that don't make sense it may be just because she's shy
Don't take advantage of her lack of understanding just because you think you could
Treat her right, treat her good take her home and make her feel the way she should

'Coz she's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around
'Coz she's in love with you
She's in love with you,
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you go, she may not let you know
but she's in love with you

So if you happen to be out one night and someone asks you where you're gonna go
Just remember she's not like the other girls she may not want them all to know
Though she may need a little time she never wants to stand in line the way they would
So treat her nice, treat her good, treat her like you know you should
You may never find another girl like her

'Coz she's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around
'Coz she's in love with you
She's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you go, she may not let you know
but she's in love with you

So take her home and hold her close touch her where she feels it most, but be true
And when she's making love to you she'll do what you want her to
Treat her good, treat her like you know you should
You may never find another girl like her

'Coz she's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around
'Coz she's in love with you
She's in love with you

92,Andy Gibb,(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away,1979,"Maybe I don't wanna know the reason, why?
But lately you don't talk to me darling
I can't see me in your eyes, I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe

To watch you leave and let this feeling die
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love, you know I can't survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

We can take the darkness and make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die?
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone

And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on
No other woman's love could be as true, I'm begging you

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

We changed the world, we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real but I still feel you here inside

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love

Good Girls Don't
She's your adolescent dream,
Schoolboy stuff, a sticky sweet romance.
And she makes you want to scream,
Wishing you could get inside her pants.
So, you fantasize away.
And while you're squeezing her, you thought you heard her saying...

""Good girls don't,
Good girls don't,
Good girls don't, but I do.""

So, you call her on the phone
To talk about the teachers that you hate.
And she says she's all alone,
And her parents won't be coming home til late.
There's a ringing in your brain,
Cause you could've sworn you though you heard her saying...

""Good girls don't,
Good girls don't,
Good girls don't, but I do.""

And it's a teenage sadness
Everyone has got to taste.
An in-between age madness
That you know you can't erase
Til she's sitting on your face.

You're alone with her at last,
And you're waiting til you think the time is right.
Cause you've heard she's pretty fast.
And you're hoping that she'll give you some tonight.
So, you start to make your play,
Cause you could've sworn you thought you heard her saying...

94,Joe Jackson,Is She Really Going Out With Him?,1979,"Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (where?)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here

Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there (where?)
There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much, if so, there goes your proof

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here
Around here

But if looks could kill
There's a man there who is marked down as dead
'Cause I've had my fill
Listen you, take your hands from her head
I get so mean around the scene
Hey, hey, hey

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here
Around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around"
95,Supertramp,Goodbye Stranger,1979,"It was an early morning yesterday
I was up before the dawn
And I really have enjoyed my stay
But I must be moving on
Like a king without a castle
Like a queen without a throne
I'm an early morning lover
And I must be moving on yeah yeah
Now I believe in what you say is the undisputed truth
But I have to have things my own way
To keep me in my youth
Like a ship without an anchor
Like a slave without a chain
Just the thought of those sweet ladies
Sends a shiver through my veins
And I will go on shining
Shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me my troubles will be few
Goodbye stranger it's been nice
Hope you find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true
Goodbye Mary goodbye Jane
Will we ever meet again?
Feel no sorrow feel no shame
Come tomorrow feel no pain
Sweet devotion (goodbye Mary)
It's not for me (goodbye Jane)
Just give me motion
(will we ever)
To set me free (meet again?)
In the land and the ocean
(feel no sorrow)
Far away (feel no shame)
It's the life I've chosen
(come tomorrow)
Every day (feel no pain)
So goodbye Mary
(goodbye Mary)
Goodbye Jane (goodbye Jane)
Will we ever (will we ever)
Meet again? (meet again?)
Now some they do and some they don't
And some you just can't tell
And some they will and some they won't
With some it's just as well
You can laugh at my behavior that'll never bother me
Say the devil is my savior
But I don't pay no heed
And I will go on shining
Shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me my troubles will be few
Goodbye stranger it's been nice
Hope you find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view

Every day (feel no pain)
So now I'm leaving
(goodbye Mary)
Got to go (goodbye Jane)
Hit the road (will we ever?)
I'll say it once again
(meet again)
Oh, yes I'm leaving

Every one from a to z
I can cast a spell

Mix a special brew
Put fire inside of you
But anytime you feel
Danger or fear
Instantly I will appear, 'cause

I can sense your needs

Like rain on to the seeds
I can make a rhyme
Of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down
To some good old fashioned love
That's what I've got plenty of, 'cause
I ain't braggin' 'cause I'm the one

You just ask me ooh and it shall be done
And don't bother to compare
'cause I've got it
I've got it, I've got it, yeah
