1,Elvis Presley,(You're The) Devil in Disguise,1963,"You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got wise

You're the devil in disguise
Oh yes, you are the devil in disguise
You fooled me with your kisses
You cheated and you schemed
Heaven knows how you lied to me
You're not the way you seemed

You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got wise

You're the devil in disguise
Oh yes, you are the devil in disguise
I thought that I was in heaven
But I was sure surprised
Heaven help me, I didn't see
The devil in your eyes

You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got wise

You look devil in disguise
Oh yes, you are the devil in disguise

You look devil in disguise
Oh yes, you are the devil in disguise
Oh yes, you are the devil in disguise
Oh yes, you are the devil in disguise"

Louie Louie, oh no
Me gotta go
Aye-yi-yi-yi, I said

And where he goes I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow

I will follow him
Follow him wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
Or mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away

I must follow him
Ever since he touched my hand I knew
That near him I always must be
And nothing can keep him from me
He is my destiny

I love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow

He'll always be my true love
My true love, my true love
From now until forever
Forever, forever

I will follow him
Follow him wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
Or mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away
Away from my arms

I love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow

He'll always be my true love
My true love, my true love
From now until forever
Forever, forever

I will follow him
Follow him wherever he may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
Or mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away
Away from my arms"

9,Singing Nun (Soeur Sourire),Dominique,1963,"Dominic

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Nic, goes along very simply
Travelling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

In the age when John Lackland
Was the king of England,
Our father, Dominix
Fought the Albigensians.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Travelling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

One day a heretic
Led him through the brambles,
But our father, Dominic
By his own joy, converted him.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Travelling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

Without a camel or a coach,
He travelled Europe on foot,
Scandinavia and Provence,
In saintly poverty.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Traveling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

He enflamed with ardor
Boys and girls of every school,
And by sowing the Word
He founded the Brother Preachers.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Traveling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

In the home of Dominic and his brothers,
Bread started becoming scarce,
And two angels presented themselves,
Bearing two great golden loaves.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Traveling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

Dominic saw in a dream
The preachers of the whole world
Under the mantle of the Virgin
In great number assembled.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Travelling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord.

Dominic, my good Father,
Keep us simple and happy
By announcing to our brothers
The Way and the Truth.

Dominic, Nic, Nic
Goes along very simply
Travelling in poverty and singing.
On every road, in every place,
He just talks about the Lord,
He just talks about the Lord."
10,Ned Miller,From a Jack to a King,1963,"From a Jack to a King
Elvis Presley
(Words & music by Miller)

From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding ring
I've played a ace and I won the queen
I walked away with your heart
From a jack to a king
With no regrets I stacked, I stacked the cards, I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
You made me king of your heart
Oh for just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Oh but just in time I saw that twinkle in your eyes
From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding, wedding, wedding ring
I played an ace and I won the queen
You made me king of your heart
For just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Oh but just in time I saw, I saw that twinkle in your eyes
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding, wedding, wedding ring
I played an ace and I won the queen
You made me king of your heart"
11,Lesley Gore,It's My Party,1963,"It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
And Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

Playin' my records, keep dancin' all night
Or leave me alone for a while
'Til Johnny's dancin' with me
I've got no reason to smile

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

Judy and Johnny just walked through the door
Like a queen with her king
Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearin' his ring

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you"

14,Bobby Vinton,Blue Velvet,1963,"Blue velvet
She wore Blue Velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light

From the stars
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender sighs

Love was ours
Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly

But when she left gone was the glow of
Blue Velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years

And I still can see Blue Velvet through my tears
She wore Blue Velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see Blue Velvet through my tears

I didn't have many toys
But my momma used to say son
You got more than other boys

Now you may not be good looking
And you may not be too rich
But you'll never ever be alone
'Cause you've got lucky lips

Lucky lips are always kissing
Lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always
Find a pair of lips so true

I don't need a four leaf clover
Rabbit foot or a good luck charm
With lucky lips you'll always
Have a baby in your arms

Now I never get heartbroken
No, I'll never get the blues
And if I play that game of love
I know I just can't lose

When they spin that wheel of fortune
All I do is kiss my chips
And I know I'm bound to win, yeah
'Cause I've got lucky lips

Lucky lips are always kissing
Lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find
A pair of lips so true

Don't need a four leaf clover
Rabbit's foot or a good luck charm
With lucky lips you'll always have
A baby in your arms

Lucky lips are always kissing
Lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find
A love's that's true

I need a four leaf clover
Rabbit's foot or a good luck charm
With lucky lips you'll always have
A baby in your arms"
19,The Crystals,Then He Kissed Me,1963,"Well, he walked up to me and he asked me if I wanted to dance.
He looked kinda nice and so I said I might take a chance.
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me.

Each time I saw him I couldn't wait to see him again.
I wanted to let him know that he was more than a friend.
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered I love you
And he said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me.

He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before,
He kissed me in a way that I wanna be kissed forever more.

I knew that he was mine so I gave him all the love that I had
And one day he took me home to meet his mom and his dad.
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side.
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me.

Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side.
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me.
And then he kissed me.
And then he kissed me"
20,Johnny Cash,Ring of Fire,1963,"Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring

I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher

And it burns, burns, burns

When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

I fell in to a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher

And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire

21,Skeeter Davis,The End of the World,1963,"Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
'Cause you don't love me anymore...
Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know its the end of the world?
It ended when i lost your love...
I wake up in the morning and i wonder
Why everything's the same as it was...
i can't understand, no- i can't understand
How life goes on the way it does...
Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

23,Cascades,Rhythm of the Rain,1963,"Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again
The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart
Rain, please tell me, now, does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care?
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away
The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Rain, won't you tell her that I love her so?
Please, ask the sun to set her heart aglow

Rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain

And let me be alone again

27,Roy Orbison,In Dreams,1963,"A candy-colored clown they call the Sandman
Tiptoes to my room every night
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper
""Go to sleep, everything is all right""

I close my eyes, then I drift away
Into the magic night, I softly say
A silent prayer like dreamers do
Then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you

In dreams I walk with you
In dreams I talk to you
In dreams you're mine all of the time
We're together in dreams, in dreams

But just before the dawn
I awake and find you gone
I can't help it, I can't help it, if I cry
I remember that you said goodbye

It's too bad that all these things
Can only happen in my dreams
Only in dreams
In beautiful dreams"

In a world of our own (doo, so in love)
As we stroll by the sea together
Under stars twinkling high above
So in love are we two
No one else but me and you
So in love (doo, so in love)
So much in love (doo, so in love)
So in love (doo, so in love)
So much in love (doo, so in love)
We stroll along together
I tell you I need you oh so much
I love, love you my darling
Can you tell it in my touch?
When we walk down the aisle together
We will vow to be together till we die
So much love have we two
Just can't wait to say ""I do""
So in love (doo, so in love)
Are you and I (doo, you and I)
So in love (doo, so in love)
Are you and I (doo, you and I)

32,Roy Orbison,Blue Bayou,1963,"I feel so bad I've got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou

Savin' nickels, savin' dimes
Workin' till the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on Blue Bayou

I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou
All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou

I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Ah, that girl of mine by my side, the silver moon and the evening tide
Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside

I'll never be blue, my dreams come true
On Blue Bayou"

They say that, I'll find happiness in someone
Else, warm caress, the next time
I'll soon forget, your kiss and heartaches, such as this will

Just be ancient history
They say that, I'm a fool to weep
That, I won't go on losing sleep, the next time

And someone else will mend the heart you've broken in two
But how can I fall in love the next time?
When I'm still, so much in love with you
When I'm still, so much in love with you"

On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there, the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (Up on the roof)
I get away from the hustling crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street (Up on the roof)

On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof (Up on the roof)

At night, the stars put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
I keep-a tellin' you

Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof (Up on the roof)
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof (Up on the roof)

Up on the roof (Up on the roof)
Oh, come on, baby (Up on the roof)
Oh, come on, honey (Up on the roof)
Everything is all right (Up on the roof)"

Has high blood pressure got a hold on me?

Tears all over my face

I got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day
The county's gonna haul my belongings away cause I'm busted.

I went to my brother to ask for a loan cause I was busted
I hate to beg like a dog without his bone, but I'm busted

My wife and my kids are all down with the flu,
And I was just thinking about calling on you 'cause I'm busted.

Well, I am no thief, but a man can go wrong when he's busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone and I'm busted
The fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow,

(A Letter From Camp)
Hello Muddah, hello Fadduh,
Here I am at Camp Granada.
Camp is very entertaining,
And they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining.
I went hiking with Joe Spivey.
He developed poison ivy.
You remember Leonard Skinner.
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner.
All the counselors hate the waiters,
And the lake has alligators.
And the head coach wants no sissies,
So he reads to us from something called Ulysses.
Now I don't want this should scare ya,
But my bunk mate has malaria.
You remember Jeffrey Hardy.

They're about to organize a searching party.
Take me home, oh Muddah, Fadduh,
Take me home, I hate Granada,
Don't leave me out here in the forest, where
I might get eaten by a bear.
Take me home, I promise I will not make noise,
Or mess the house with other boys.
Oh please don't make me stay,
I've been here one whole day.
Dearest Fadduh, darling Muddah,
How's my precious little Bruddah?
Let me come home if you miss me.
I would even let Aunt Bertha hug and kis me.
Wait a minute, it stopped hailing.
Guys are swimming, guys are sailing.
Playing baseball, gee that's better.
Muddah, Fadduh, kindly disregard this letter!"

And I would bring

Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your first sweet kiss thrilled me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never ever let you go

And if you wanted a love to last forever
Darlin' I would send my love your way
And my love'd not only last forever
But forever and a day
And I would bring

Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your first sweet kiss thrilled me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never ever let you go"

If you love somebody new, let me find a new love, too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

Be as fair to my heart as you can be, you can be
Then if you no longer care for the love that's beating there
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

With a letter in front

I got a decal in back

So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
And let your colors fly
Be true to your school

On Friday we'll be jacked
Up on the football game
And I'll be ready to fight
We're gonna smash 'em now
My girl will be working
On her pom-poms now
And she'll be yelling tonight

-Artist: Bobby Vee from ""Very Best Of Bobby Vee""-United Artists-UA LA 332E
-peak Billboard position # 3 in 1962-63
-Words and Music by Benjamin Weisman, Dorothy Wayne, and Marilynn Garrett

They say that you're a runaround lover
Though you say it isn't so
But if you put me down for another
I'll know, believe me, I'll know

CHORUS
'cause the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes can't help but see if you are true to me
So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes

You say that you're at home when you phone me
And how much you really care
Though you keep telling me that you're lonely
I'll know if someone is there

CHORUS

One of these days you're gonna be sorry
'cause your game I'm gonna play
And you'll find out without really tryin'
Each time that my kisses stray

'cause the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes will see me too
And no matter what I do
I could never disguise all my little white lies
'cause the night has a thousand eyes

So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes
