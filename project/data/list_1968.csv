1,The Beatles,Hey Jude,1968,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart

Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid

You were made to go out and get her

The minute you let her under your skin

Then you begin to make it better

And any time you feel the pain

Hey Jude, refrain

Don't carry the world upon your shoulder

For well you know that it's a fool

Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na na na naa-naa

na-na-naa naaa
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
(Let it out and let it in)
Remember (hey Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Na na na naa-naa
na-na-naa naaa
Yeah
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song
And make it better
Remember to let her under your skin (got the wrong chord!)
Then you begin (fucking hell)
To make it better

3,The Rolling Stones,Jumpin' Jack Flash,1968,"One, two!

I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the drivin' rain

But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm jumpin' jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back

But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm jumpin' jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas
Ooh

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled, yeah yeah
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yeah yeah yeah
I was crowned with a spike right through my head

But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm jumpin' jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

Jumpin' jack flash, it's a gas

4,Otis Redding,(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay,1968,"Sittin' in the morning sun
I'll be sittin' when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia, headed for the Frisco bay
'Cos I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothing's gonna come my way

So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, listen

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen
2000 miles I've roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Now I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time"
5,Marvin Gaye,I Heard it Through the Grapevine,1968,"Ooh I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys you know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
(took me by surprise I must say)
When I found out yesterday

(when I found out yesterday)
Don'tcha know that I
Heard it through the grapevine
(woo... woo...) Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh (woo... woo) I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah

(heard it through the grapevine)
not much longer would you be my baby (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears (ooh...) I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean (ooh...) that much to me
You could have told me yourself

you could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
(that you love someone else)
Instead I
Heard it through the grapevine
Not much (ooh... ooh... ooh...) longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine

And I'm (ooh... ooh... ooh...) just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah
(heard it through the grapevine)
(not much longer would you be my baby (ooh-ooh doo-doo)
People say believe half of what you see Son and none of what you hear
But I can't help bein' confused
If it's true please tell me dear

Do you plan to let me go
(do you plan to let me go)
For the other guy you loved before
Don'tcha know I
Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Baby I heard it through the grapevine

Ooh I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah

not much longer would you be my baby (yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Honey honey I know that you're lettin' me go

6,Bobby Goldsboro,Honey,1968,"See the tree? how big it's grown,
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big...
I laughed at her, and she got mad
The first day that she planted it
Was just a twig...
Then the first snow came,
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die...
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And i laughed 'til i cried...
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb, and kinda smart
And i loved her so...
And i surprised her with a puppy,
Kept me up all Christmas eve,
2 years ago...
And it would sure embarrass her when i came in from workin' late,
Cause i would know...
That she'd been sittin there an' cryin',
Over some sad and silly late, late show...

And Honey, i miss you...
And i'm bein' good...
And i'd love to be with you...

If only i could...

She wrecked the car, and she was sad
And so afraid that i'd be mad,
But, what the heck?...
Though i pretended hard to be,
Guess you could say she saw through me,
And hugged my neck...
I came home unexpectedly,
And caught her cryin' needlessly, in the middle of the day...

And it was in the early spring, when flowers bloom, and robins sing,
She went away...

And Honey, i miss you...

And i'm bein' good...
And i'd love to be with you...
If only i could...

One day while i was not at home,
While she was there, and all alone,
The angels came...
Now all i have is memories of Honey
And i wake up nights,
And call her name...
Now my life's an empty stage, where Honey lived, and Honey played
And love grew up...
and a small cloud passes over head,
And cries down on the flower bed that,
Honey lov"

8,The Beatles,Lady Madonna,1968,"Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was Heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creep in like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

Lady Madonna, lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stockings needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet"
9,Tom Jones,Delilah,1968,"I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window
I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind
She was my woman
As she deceived me I watched and went out of my mind
My, my, my, Delilah.
Why, why, why, Delilah?
I could see that girl was no good for me
But I was lost like a slave that no man could free
At break of day when that man drove away I was waiting
I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door
She stood there laughing
I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more
My, my, my, Delilah.
Why, why, why, Delilah?
So before they come to break down the door
Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take anymore

She stood there laughing
I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more
My, my, my, Delilah.
Why, why, why, Delilah?
So before they come to break down the door
Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take anymore
Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take anymore"
10,Barry Ryan,Eloise,1968,"Every night I'm there,
I'm always there, she knows I'm there,
and heaven knows, I hope she goes.
I find it hard to realize that love was in her eyes,
it's dying now, she knows I'm crying now,
And every night I'm there, I break my heart to please
Eloise, Eloise.
You know I'm on my knees, yeah, I said please.
You're all I want so hear my prayer, my prayer.

My Eloise is like the stars that please the night,
the sun that makes the day, that lights the way.
And when my star goes by, I'll hold it in my hands and cry,
her love is mine, my sun will shine.
Every night I'm there I break my heart to please
Eloise, Eloise.

You're all I want, you gotta hear my prayer.

My Eloise, I'd love to please her,
I'd love to care, but she's not there.
And when I find you, I'd be so kind,
you'd want to stay, I know you'd stay.

And as the days grow old, the nights grow cold,
I wanna hold her near to me, I know she's dear to me.
And only time can tell and take away this lonely hell,
I'm on my knees to Eloise.
And every night I'm there, I break my heart to please
Eloise, Eloise.
You are my life so hear my prayer.
You are the price, I know you're there.
You're all I want so hear my prayer.
You're all I need and I'm not there,
you know I'm not there."
11,The Moody Blues,Nights in White Satin,1968,"Nights in white satin never reaching the end
Letters I've written never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed with these eyes before
Just what the truth is I can't say any more

'Cause, I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you, oh

Gazing at people, some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through, they can't understand
Some try to tell me thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be, you'll be in the end

And I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you, oh
I love you

Nights in white satin, never reaching the end
Letters I've written, never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed with these eyes before
Just what the truth is, I can't say any more

'Cause, I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you, oh

Yes, I love you

13,Louis Armstrong,(What A) Wonderful World,1968,"I see trees of green,
red roses too,
I see them bloom
for me and for you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue
and clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
of people going by

I see friends shaking hands
Saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying
""I love you.""

I hear babies cry
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Oh yeah"

I am the god of hell f ire and I bring you:
Fire, I'll take you to burn.
Fire, I'll take you to learn.
I'll see you burn!
You fought hard and you saved and learned,
but all of it's going to burn.
And your mind, your tiny mind,
you know you've really been so blind.
Now 's your time burn your mind.
You're falling far too far behind.
Oh no, oh no, oh no, you gonna burn!
Fire, to destroy all you've done.
Fire, to end all you've become.
I'll feel you burn!
You've been living like a little girl,

And your mind, your tiny mind,
you know you've really been so blind.
Now 's your time burn your mind,

21,Georgie Fame,Ballad of Bonnie & Clyde,1968,"Bonnie and Clyde were pretty lookin' people
But I can tell you people they were the devil's children
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doin'
One lazy afternoon down Savannah way
They robbed a store
And high-tailed outa that town
Got clean away in a stolen car
And waited till the heat died down
Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation
And made the graduation into the banking business
""Reach for the sky,"" sweet-talking Clyde would holler
As Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag
Now one brave man
He tried to take 'em alone
They left him lyin' in a pool of blood
And laughed about it all the way home
Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one
Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun
They used to laugh about dyin'
But deep inside 'em they knew that pretty soon they'd be lyin'
Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun and the morning dew
Acting upon reliable information
A federal deputation laid a deadly ambush
When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them
Bonnie and Clyde, they lived a lot together
And finally together they died"
22,Tom Jones,Help Yourself,1968,"Love is like candy on a shelf
You want to taste and help yourself

We're always told repeatedly
The very best in life is free
And if you want to prove it's true
Baby I'm telling you
This is what you should do
Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms just say the word, and they are yours
Just help yourself to the love,
In my heart your smile has opened up the door
The greatest wealth that exists in the world,
Could never buy what I can give
Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms, and then lets really start to live

Allllllllll right. Yeah

My heart has love enough for two
More than enough for me and you
I'm rich with love, a millionaire
I've so much, it's unfair
Why don't you take a share
Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms just say the word, and they are yours
Just help yourself to the love,
In my heart your smile has opened up the door
The greatest wealth that exists in the world
Could never buy what I can give

Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows

As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

A hurt, scorned, rejected

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

I started my life in an old, cold, run down tenement slum
My Father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my Mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

This love we're contemplating
Isn't worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating
The child we maybe creating

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, scorned by society
Love child, always second best
Love child, different from the rest

Hold on, hold on, just a little bit
Hold on, hold on, just a little bit

I started school, in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
Sop afraid my friends would see the guilt in me

Don't think that I don't need you
Don't think I don't wanna please you
No child of mine will be bearing
The name of shame I've been wearing

Love child, love child, never quite as good
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood

I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you

So if you see my girl, please send her home to me
Tell her about my heart that's slowly dying
Say I can't stop myself from crying

The Unicorn
The Unicorn
A long time ago, when the earth was green,
There were more kinds of animals than you've ever seen.
They'd run around free while the earth was being born.
And the loveliest of them all was the unicorn.

There were green alligators and long-necked geese.
Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephants, as sure as you're born.
And the loveliest of them all was the unicorn.

Now, God saw some sinning, and it gave him pain.
So he said, ""Stand back, I'm going to make it rain.""
He said, ""Hey, Brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do:
Build me a floating zoo.

And take some of them green alligators and long-necked geese.
Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephants, as sure as you're born.
And don't you forget my unicorn.""

Old Noah was there to answer the call.
He finished up making the Ark just as the rain started falling.
He marched in the animals two by two,
And he called out as they went through,

""Hey Lord, I got your green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord, I'm so forlorn.
I just can't see no unicorn.""

Then Noah looked out through the driving rain.
Them unicorns were hiding, playing silly games.
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pourin'.
Oh them silly unicorn!

There were green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Noah cried, ""Close the door, cause the rain is pourin'
And we just can't wait for no unicorn.""

The Ark started moving, it drifted with the tide.
The unicorns looked up from the rocks, and they cried.
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away.
And that's why you've never seen a unicorn, to this very day.

You'll see green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephant, but sure as you're born,
You're never gonna see no unicorn."

I've got to cover ground, you couldn't keep me down
It just ain't no good if the sun shines

When you're still inside
Shouldn't hide, still inside, shouldn't hide
Ahh, oh
(Shouldn't hide)
Ah, ah, oh
(Do, do, waa, do, do, waa)

There will be children with robins and flowers
Sunshine caresses each new waking hour
Seems to me that the people keep seeing
More and more each day, gotta say, lead the way

It's okay, Wednesday, Thursday, it's okay
(Ahh)
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, weekday, ah, ah, ohh
(Do, do, waa)

Ah, ah, oh, oh
(Do, do, aah)
Woo, ooh, ooh, oh, oh
Oh, ah, wo, do, waa
Ohh, oh, oh, oh"
93,The Cowsills,Indian Lake,1968,"You take a bus marked ""Lakewood Drive""
And you keep on ridin' 'til you're out of the city
Where the air is fine with the sweet smell of pine
And the countryside's pretty

And you'll see daffodils, peepin' over the hill
Or a honey lovin' mama bear
Just take a left at the bridge, go down to Quakertown Ridge
And in a minute you're there

Indian Lake is a scene you should make with your little one
Keep it in mind if you're lookin' to find
A place in the summer sun
You can swim in the cove, have a snack in the grove
Or you can rent a canoe
At Indian Lake you'll be able to make the way the Indians do

94,Aretha Franklin,Since You've Been Gone (Sweet Sweet Baby),1968,"Baby baby, sweet baby
There's something that I just got to say
Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurtin' in a real cold way

Speak your name
And I'll feel a thrill
You said I do
And I said I will

I tell you that I'll stay true
and give you just a little time
Wait on me baby,
I want you to be all mine
I just get so blue

Since you've been gone, baby
(why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)

Baby baby, sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips,
But not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray
But ah, babe
Hear me now
(hear me)
I don't know what I'm gonna do
(hear me)
Got to get you back somehow
(hear me now)
Oooh, take me back,
consider me please
If you walk in that door,
I can get up off my knees
I just been so blue

Since you've been gone
(why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Well I've been so lonely
(sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)
Baby, since you've been gone
(sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)
I've been so lonely
(why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Baby baby baby been so lonely

95,Sam & Dave,I Thank You,1968,"(I want everybody to get up off your seat
And get your arms together, and your hands together
And give me some of that o-o-old soul clapping)

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you

If you took your love to somewhere else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death
You made me feel like I've never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

You didn't have to squeeze me but you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to hold me but you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you

Every day was something new
You pull out your bag and your fine to-do
You got me trying new things too
Just so I can keep up with you

You didn't have to shake me like you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you

All my life I've been shortchanged
Without your love baby, it's a crying shame
And now I know what the fellas are talking about
When they say that they been turned out

I want to thank you (thank you)
Thank you (oh, baby)
Thank you baby (yeah, yeah)
Oh baby (I gotta be thanking)
Got to say

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did.
(And I thank you.)

You didn't have to hold me like you did
But you did, but you did.
(And I thank you.)

Thank you (thank you, baby)
Baby (Got to thank you)
Baby (oh, baby)
Thank! I've! Got! I've got to (thank you baby)
Thank you baby (oh baby)"

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I got your picture hangin' on the wall
It can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters when you're not near
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play my game, a fantasy
I pretend I'm not in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you phone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of being there
So let me get the real thing
So let me get the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing"
98,Classics IV,Stormy,1968,"You were the sunshine, baby, whenever you smiled
But I call you Stormy today
All of a sudden that ole rain's fallin' down
And my world is cloudy and gray
You've gone away
Oh Stormy, oh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day

Yesterday's love was like a warm summer breeze
But, like the weather ya changed
Now things are dreary, baby
And it's windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain
Callin' your name
Oh Stormy, oh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day



Oh Stormy, oh Stormy
Bring back that sunny day

Bring back that sunny day

Oh Stormy,

Oh Stormy"

The Son Of Hickory Holler's Tramp
O C Smith
From the vinyl album ""O C Smith's Greatest Hits""
Oh, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp
Yeah, the weeds were high, the corn was dry
When daddy took to drinking
Him and Sally Walker, they up and ran away
Then Momma shed a silent tear
And promised fourteen children
""I swear you'll never see a hungry day""
When Momma sacrificed her pride
The neighbours started talking
But we were much too young
To understand the things they said
All we really cared about
Was Momma's chicken dumplings
And a goodnight kiss
Before we went to bed
Oh, you know, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp
When Daddy left and destitution
Came upon our family
Not one neighbour volunteered
To lend a helping hand
So just let 'em gossip all they want
She loved us, and she raised us
The proof is standing here
A full grown man
Last summer Momma passed away
And left the ones who loved her
Each and every one is
More than grateful for their birth
And each Sunday she receives
A big bouquet of fourteen roses
With a card that reads
'The Greatest Mom on Earth'
Oh, you know, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp"
