1,Shakira & Wyclef Jean,Hips don't lie,2006,"Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting
We got the refugees up in here
No fighting, no fighting
Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama?, bonita, mi casa, su casa
Shakira, Shakira

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

I'm on tonight, you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby?
This is perfection

Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything's so unexpected
The way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama?, bonita, mi casa, su casa
Shakira, Shakira

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

I'm on tonight, you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Don't you see, baby?
Así es perfecto

Baby, I know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby?
This is perfection

Oh, boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't, so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama?, bonita, mi casa, su casa
Shakira, Shakira

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

Señorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia

Mira, en Barranquilla se baila así, say it!
En Barranquilla se baila así

Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Hump
We need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Boo-boop-so-boop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto

Oh, you know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

No fighting, no fighting"

3,Gnarls Barkley,Crazy,2006,"I remember when, I remember
I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space
And when you're out there without care

Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably
And I hope that you are

Having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice
Come on now, who do you

Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?
Well, I think you're crazy

I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart

To lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
Is thinking, I want to be like them
Ever since I was little

Ever since I was little
It looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably"
4,Beyonce,Irreplaceable,2006,"To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it please don't touch

And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my mine name that is on that tag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
And call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?

Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standing in the front yard telling me
How I am such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I'll have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable

So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you, I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is replacing you is so easy

Matter fact he'll be here in a minute

You could pack all your things, we're finished

5,Nelly Furtado,Promiscuous,2006,"Am I throwing you off?
Nope
Didn't think so

How you doin' young lady
That feelin' that you givin' really drivin' me crazy
You don't have ta play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

If you looking for a girl that'll treat you right
If you lookin' for her in the day time with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem I don't see no ring on your hand

I be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?

Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, are you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead but you're still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through

I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game I'm a lay mine's down

I'm a big girl I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team, so does everybody else

Baby, we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Hey, Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my T-shirt on
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

Bring that on, you know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash

But you're driving me crazy the way you're making me wait

Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, 'cause she be that lady, hey!

I feel you creeping up, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Ta Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore

Smack that, oh ooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore

Smack that, oh ooh

Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the lac down

Konvicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardobe intact now
I feel it, don and crack now
Ooh I see it, don't let back now

I'ma call her then I put the mack down
Money? No problem, pocket full of that now

Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo

Oh, looks like another club banger

They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a lil drink on
They gonna flip for this Akon
You can bank on it

Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls
Trying to hold my back through my drawers

Steps upstage, didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, and shes like, ""You're...""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place""
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away

Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing
Akon!

I feel you creeping up, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore

Smack that, oh ooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore

Eminem's rollin', D an' em rollin'

Boo and ol' Marvelous an' them rollin'

Hittin' no less than three
Block wheel style, like whee
Girl I can tell you want me 'cause lately
I feel you creeping up, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

7,The Scissor Sisters,I Don't Feel Like Dancin',2006,"Wake up in the morning with a head like ‘what ya done?'
This used to be the life but I don't need another one.
You like cuttin' up and carrying on, you wear them gowns.
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down?

So I'll play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right.
You'd better move when you're swayin' round the room
Looks like the magic's only ours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No sir, no dancin' today.
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if i find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed till dawn, with you,

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile.
You got so many colours make a blind man so confused.
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine.
Just please understand, when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that I'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No sir, no dancin' today.
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if i find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed till dawn, with you,

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound.
Just lay me down as you float away into the shimmer light.

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway

No sir, no dancin' today.

I will not let myself

Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

Because of you

I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you

I am afraid

I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain

And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you

Would you help me understand?

Wondering if I'll stay, young and restless
Living this way, I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets in and I don't cry
I only feel gravity and I wonder why

Well, the dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon

And the sun was wondering if it should
Stay away for a day
Til the feeling went away

And the sky was falling
And the clouds were dropping and the rain
Forgot how to bring salvation

The dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
So that they could die"

My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the saviour of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

He said, ""Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?""
""Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join The Black Parade""

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the saviour of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
You'll carry on

And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on

And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears
Oh, oh, oh
Disappointed faces of your peers
Oh, oh, oh
Take a look at me cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
You'll carry on

And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me

the reason that the sky is blue
the clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
and to him I just can't be true
and I know that he knows
I'm unfaithful and it
kills him inside
to know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore

I don't wanna be the reason why

every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
as I'm doing my hair
preparing for another day
a kiss upon my cheek
as here on refonlicky
as if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
just hanging with the girls
a lie I didn't have to tell
because we both know
where I'm about to go
and we know it very well
cause I know that
he knows I'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that I am happy with
some other guy

I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life

I don't wanna be a murderer

our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun
and put it to his head
get it over with

I don't wanna do this anymore
anymoree
ohooooo
any anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
cause evreytime I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
a murderer

32,Sandi Thom,I Wish I Was A Punk Rocker (With Flowers In My Hair),2006,"Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late to a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When the head of state didn't play guitar
Not everybody drove a car
When music really mattered and when radio was king
When accountants didn't have control
And the media couldn't buy your soul
And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late to a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When pop stars still remained a myth
And ignorance could still be bliss
And when God Save the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale
When my mom and dad were in their teens
And anarchy was still a dream
And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late to a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When record shops were on top
And vinyl was all that they stocked
And the super info-highway was still drifting out in space
Kids were wearing hand-me-downs
And playing games meant kick arounds
And footballers who had long hair and dirt across their face

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air
I was born too late to a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

I was born too late to a world that doesn't care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair"

Chemistry was crazy from the get go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time

People swore it off as a phase, said we can't see that

It's so true that yes, we've been through it, yes

Curtain Call
When I'm Gone
[Introduction]
Yeah...
It's my life...
My own words I guess...

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""Daddy look what I made"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

[Verse 2]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?""
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying
""You always say that, you always say this is the last time
""But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine""
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'""
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right"" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

[Verse 3]
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
""You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
""And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
""That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
""I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are gone""
But baby wait, ""it's too late Dad, you made the choice
""Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""die Shady"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say..

[Chorus/Outro]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

And how we used to shine

We are one, that's a fact
That you can't deny

38,The Fray,Over My Head (Cable Car),2006,"I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the arguments in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's all on

And suddenly I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and its effortless
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head, I'm over my...

Everyone knows I'm in

This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try.
Please give me something
Because someday I might know my heart.

You only waited up for hours
Just to spend a little time alone with me
I can say I' ve bought you flowers
Because I can't work out what they mean

That was someone else's dream

And the words that I could never say
Are gonna come out anyway .

I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

I could breakaway

I'll do what it takes til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change

Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye

I'm half the man I thought I would be:
But you can have what's left of me
I've been dying inside
Little by little

No where to go
But going out of my mind
In endless circles
Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still

Falling faster
Barely breathing
Give me something
To believe in
Tell me: It's not all in my head
Take what's left
Of this man
Make me whole
Once again

And I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin

You can have all that's left, yeah yeah yeah
What's left of me?

To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now- here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined when you were young

Can we climb this mountain
I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy

Easy now, watch it go

We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning

When you were young
When you were young
And sometimes you close your eyes

and see the place where you Used to live
When you were young
They say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now

But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while
You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now- here he comes
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined when you were young
When you were young

Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.
So I took what's mine by eternal right.
Took your soul out into the night.
It may be over but it won't stop there,
I am here for you if you'd only care.
You touched my heart you touched my soul.
You changed my life and all my goals.
And love is blind and that I knew when,
My heart was blinded by you.
I've kissed your lips and held your head.
Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
I know you well, I know your smell.
I've been addicted to you.

Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.

I am a dreamer but when I wake,
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.
And as you move on, remember me,
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.
I've watched you sleeping for a while.
I'd be the father of your child.
I'd spend a lifetime with you.
I know your fears and you know mine.
We've had our doubts but now we're fine,
And I love you, I swear that's true.
I cannot live without you.

Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.

And I still hold your hand in mine.
In mine when I'm asleep.
And I will bear my soul in time,
When I'm kneeling at your feet.
Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.

I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow."

Sipping tea in the bar by the road side (just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo.
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change.
Don't you think it's strange?

When you gonna realise that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to.

Odds are you won't like what it is
When the storm arrives would you be seen with me
By the merciless eyes I've deceived?

I've seen angels fall from blinding heights
But you yourself are nothing so divine
Just next in line

Arm yourself because no one else here will save you
The odds will betray you and I will replace you
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you, are you willing to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins
You know my name

If you come inside things will not be the same
When you return to the night
And if you think you've won you never saw me change
The game that we have been playing

I've seen diamonds cut through harder men
Than you yourself but if you must pretend
You may meet your end

Arm yourself because no one else here will save you
The odds will betray you and I will replace you
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you, are you willing to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins

Try to hide your hand, forget how to feel
(Forget how to feel)
Life is gone with just a spin of the wheel

Arm yourself because no one else here will save you
The odds will betray you and I will replace you

We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

And we're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting

So that she had to roam the streets

I doubt she does receipts

Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know!

Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
I'm sorry love I'll have to turn you down

He must be up to something
Want half a chance to show he's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around here

And look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous
And he don't even have to say 'owt
She understands she's here to get picked up

And she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
She don't stop in the winter, no and...

C ain't after A and B when you with me
It don't make sense right now but it will
Later on when you see how I make you feel

Regular ain't in my vocabulary
When it comes to love makin', neither is missionary
Positions, girl pick one better yet some
Never mind that we tryin all of 'em so

Girl, get comfortable, we 'bout to do something you never done before
Baby, not the usual, tonight we gettin' unpredictable
So try to roll with me, baby, baby
I'm a make you feel like you never felt
Girl, all because you let me get unpredictable

I know you're used to dinner and a movie
Why not be my dinner, while makin' a movie
Do you get, get it? Do you got, got it?
Good, good, good, girl I knew you would

See what I got over a lot of fellas
Is that I'm more creative
And soon you will see what I mean
What I mean so

Baby, not the usual, tonight we gettin' unpredictable
So try to roll with me baby, baby
I'm a make you feel like you never felt
Girl, all because you let me get unpredictable

All aboard, the spontaneous express
Never the less always the more
From the pool table to the kitchen floor
Next stops the G spot, Luda, hahaha
I like it too, baby

Let me put a little bit of excitement up in your lifestyle
You gotta know the times of the essence I'm talkin' right now
I can get, get rid of that headache, what you doin' tonight
Some say that sex is overrated but they just ain't doin' it right

I keep it interestin', baby, just take them clothes off
I'll be your Tylenol, just take me till you dose off
Wake you up in the middle of the night and take you to another world
You'll wake up in the mornin' feelin' like another girl

Girl, get comfortable, we 'bout to do something you never done before
Baby, not the usual, tonight we gettin' unpredictable
So try, so try to roll wit me baby, baby

Girl, all because you let me get unpredictable

Let's do everything in reverse
I say we smoke this cigarette right now

Better go back to your mama, she'll take care of you

With you, got the riot city blues

One thing I have to say before I have to go
Be careful with your seed, you will reap just what you sow
Yeah, what can a poor boy do? What can I do?
You better go back to your mama, she'll take care of you
One last time
