Killing Me Softly With His Song
The Fugees

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.
And so I came to see him and lip sing for a while.
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
(one time, one time)
singing my life with his words,
(two time, two time)
killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song,
telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on.

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
(one time, one time)
singing my life with his words,
(two time, two time)
killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song,
telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song

(instramental interlude)

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
(yes he was)
singing my life with his words,
killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song,
telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song

For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right

For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful, baby
You're the one who held me up, never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach

You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Don't leave me out in the rain

The nights are so unkind

When you walked out the door

Take back that sad word good-bye

Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused

When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights

Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me

6,Everything But The Girl,Missing,1996,"I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door, but you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere, like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain

Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead, of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain

Back on the train, I ask why did I come again?
Can I confess, I've been hanging round your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer, nothing since you've moved
You're long gone, but I can't move on

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you

I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door, I guess you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere, like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you,
And I miss you,
You found some better place

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, and I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain

That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Back beat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me

Who would've thought it figures

Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
Well, isn't this nice? Isn't this ironic? Don't you think?

Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And ya well life has a funny way of helping you out when
You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up in your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A no smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams and then meeting his beautiful wife
Isn't it ironic don't you think a little too ironic and yeah I really do think

It's like rain on your wedding day

10,Joan Osborne,One of Us,1996,"If God had a name what would it be?

11,George Michael,Jesus to a Child,1996,"Kindness in your eyes
I guess you heard me cry
You smiled at me
Like, Jesus to a child

I'm blessed, I know
Heaven sent, heaven stole
You smiled at me
Like, Jesus to a child

And what have I learned
From all this pain
I thought I never feel the same
About anyone
Or anything again
But now I know

When you find love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there is no hope in sight

Sadness in my eyes
No one guessed, well no one tried
You smiled at me
Like, Jesus to a child

Loveless and cold
With your last breathe you saved my soul
You smiled at me
Like, Jesus to a child

And what have I learned
From all these tears
I've waited for you all those years
Then just when it began
He took your love away
But I still say

When you find love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Comfort you when there is no hope in sight

So the words you could not say
I'll sing them for you
And the love we would have made
I'll make it for two
For every single memory
Has become a part of me

You will always be
My love
Well I've been loved
So I know just what love is
And the lover that I kissed is always by my side
Oh,  the lover I still miss
Was Jesus to a child"

Let's just say that maybe, you could help
to ease my mind, baby, I ain't Mr. Right
(repeat 1)

So close I can taste it now baby, so close

In the absence of security, I made my way into the night
Stupid Cupid keeps on calling me
And I see lovin' in his eyes
I miss my baby, oh yeah, I miss my baby tonight
So why don't we make a little room
In my BMW, babe, searchin' for some peace of mind
Hey, I'll help you find it
I do believe that we are practicing the same religion

Oh you really oughta get up now, that's right
Oh you really oughta get up

17,OMC,How Bizarre,1996,"Brother Pele's in the back, sweet Zina's in the front
Cruisin' down the freeway in the hot, hot sun
Suddenly red-blue lights flash us from behind
Loud voice booming, ""Please step out onto the line""
Pele preaches words of comfort, Zina just hides her eyes
Policeman taps his shades, ""Is that a Chevy '69?""

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

Destination unknown, as we pull in for some gas
Freshly pasted poster reveals a smile from the past
Elephants and acrobats, lions snakes monkey
Pele speaks ""righteous,"" Sister Zina says ""funky""

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Everytime I look around
Everytime I look around (Everytime I look around)
Everytime I look around
It's in my face

Ring master steps out and says ""the elephants left town""
People jump and jive, but the clowns have stuck around
TV news and camera, there's choppers in the sky
Marines, police, reporters ask where, for and why
Pele yells, ""We're outta here,"" Zina says, ""Right on""
We're making moves and starting grooves before they knew we were gone
Jumped into the Chevy and headed for big lights
Wanna know the rest? Hey, buy the rights...

How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west

Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where that bomb ass hemp be
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-makin-machines servin fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace

Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearin hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol
The life of a west side playa where cowards die and it's all ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies (that's right)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program worldwide
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sacktown
The Bay Area and back down

19,No Mercy,Where Do You Go?,1996,"Where do you go, my lovely?
Where do you go?
I wanna know, my lovely, I wanna know

Where do you go, oh, oh, eh, oh?
I wanna know, oh, oh, eh, oh
Where do you go, oh, oh, eh, oh?
I wanna know

You leave without a word, no message, no number
And now my head is pounding like rolling thunder
You left me with a heartache deep inside
Girl, you should see me cry all night, and I wonder

Everybody says, ""What a shame, what is wrong?""
They don't like the game we play
Heard you're hanging 'round every night until dawn
I'm waiting for you night and day

Where do you go, my lovely?
Where do you go?
I wanna know, my lovely, I wanna know

You gotta break the silence, don't keep me waiting
Just like a river flowing to the sea
You're running back to me
Come, hear what I'm saying

Where do you go, my lovely?
I wanna know

Where do you go, oh, oh, oh?
Where do you go, oh, oh, oh?
I wanna know
Where do you, where do you go?

Save me

Come back and dry the tears, I cried for you, baby
You've gotta stop this heartache deep inside
You've gotta help me make it through the night safely
Come back and save me"
20,BLACKstreet & Dr Dre,No Diggity,1996,"You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on playette
Play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like Acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me straight up
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, you don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
(Well)
I think about the girl all the time (well, well)

East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound,
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching feelings is a no,
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You got to pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo, that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on playette
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
You're my kind of girl, no diggity
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey

Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfucking thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I predicted so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kicking game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is born, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I'll be sending a call, let's say around 3: 30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo, that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on playette

22,Celine Dion,It's All Coming Back to Me Now,1996,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If i just listened to it
Right outside the window

There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And i just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And i can't remember where or when or how
And i banished every memory you and i had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When i touch you like this
And i hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(it's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things i'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby baby

If i kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper

There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And i made myself so strong again somehow
And i never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if i touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if i kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(it's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when i see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this
If i forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when i see you like that
We see just what we want to see
Al coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now

(it's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
(it's all coming back to me now)
And when i touch you like that
(it's all coming back to me now)
If you do it like this

Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd once never been
All the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away

So I'll start the revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I hear you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock n Roll band
Who'll throw it all away

So I'll start the revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by

Inside of my private thoughts
I can imagine you
Touching my private parts
With just the thought of you
I can't help but touch myself
That's why I want you so bad

Just one night of
Moonlight, with you there beside me
All night, doin' it again and again
You know, I want you so bad

When I'm around you, baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
Baby, you're makin' me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Can't get my mind off you
I think I might be obsessed
The very thought of you
Makes me want to get undressed
I wanna be with you
Inspite of what my heart says
I guess I want you too bad

All I want is
Moonlights, with you there inside me

I want to feel your heart and soul inside of me
Let's make a deal you roll, I lick
And we can go flying into ecstasy
Oh, darlin' you and me
Light my fire, blow my flame
Take me, take me, take me away
Yeah, yeah

Well all I only want is
Moonlights, with you there inside me

33,The Smashing Pumpkins,1979,1996,"Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
June bug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust, I guess; forgotten and absorbed
To the earth below

Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues down to see

That we don't even care as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below

Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it to see

That we don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust, I guess; forgotten and absorbed
To the earth below

As you see there's no one around"

Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm cryin' inside
And nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say, the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumblin' down

I can say it so clearly, but you're nowhere around
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody know it but me
I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm tremblin' inside
And nobody knows it but me
I lie awake it's a quarter past three
I'm screamin' at night if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah, my heart is callin' you
And nobody knows it but me

How blue can I get, you could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know I'll be lovin' you still
The nights are lonely the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me
Yeah, Ohh, uhh, whoa, omom
Nobody, nobody, but me
Tomorrow morning I'm hittin' the dusty road
Gonna find you where ever, ever you might go
And I'm gonna unload my heart
And hope you come back to me

In the clear moon light
Without fear... insomnia
I can't get no sleep

I used to worry, thought I was goin' mad in a hurry
Gettin' stress, makin' excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me and let me dream of
Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearin' off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks
Since I last slept, kept takin' sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night I write by candle light
I find insight, fundamental movement, uh
So when it's back this insomniac take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack

(Shock G)

You say you got five on my tenda
You can bend over the table
But be sure bring my stallion back to my stable
Say, brush?

No elementary school ground plan
Not a five dollar bill
But five double zero on the real, feel
I'm on the level, stair mellow

No criticism from the fellows, hello
Being keyed during a high speed
But still don't tap the B.B.s
I'm dizzy, Dru Down, baby

Like Nyquil, I drop fever, so either put your five up
Or ya gots to leave it like beaver 'cause see ya
Nigge Perk land broke and smoke ya spliff all day
Go home and buy big tricky with his pretty Impala

I got five on the Hennessey, Segrims and 40's
Cause this is how we do it like Montell Jordan
I'm from the Oakland city, framed nigge is a gonna
Now I'm blowin' it up like Oklahoma

Put ya five with my fin, best believe we'll bend
Mo corners than you thought, to somethin' writers bought
More sizz-acks, believe that talkin', where you from?
Oakland

Smokin' in attempts to crack the chest plate
The zips be so fluffy, the whole town loves me
An every event I'm sacked up
So if ya need me, scream double R when ya see me

I got five on it, grab ya four, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' wit' dat indo weed
I got five on it, it's got me stuck and toed back
I got five on it, potna, let's go half on a sack

E-40, why ya treat me so bad?
40 makes it happen, fives gets slapped
And rubbin' them girls just a little bit of light weight
Flamboyant, potent fumes lingerin' mighty clouds and molten lights

You expect to bit the baron an you'll be violatin' my civil rights
I'm startin' to feel my scrilla but perhaps today my scrilla ain't feelin' me
For the simple fact that I'm off to the track with hella fools three
Pockets empty, pitchin' five, man I'm dusted took off my hat
Passed it around, sprinkle me

Me an E-40 to the head, comin' fifth, plus
You let the lead bust, ready to do a murda, man?
Curved off the Hurricane, hurled again
Witness we'll bein' off two-fifths equal

Killing people like Jason, facin' death every sequel
(Insane in the membrane)
Bring the pain like Method neglected
Smokin' crips to the night to the brains for breakfast
'Cause for the indo fins do the evil that men do
Give me five and I shall proceed and continue

I got five on it, grab ya four, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' wit' dat indo weed
I got five on it, it's got me stuck and toed back
I got five on it, potna, let's go half on a sack

Yeah, it's been a while since I've hollered from the town
Mess around heard young genome said, ""I've gotta be down""
'Cause new styles is goin' down, look around you
Tunes from the Luniz spread round an round you

Back to get my O on, they let me flow on
The thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it
Still brinin' satin for them draws
Velvet for the mic and got a pound for the 'cause

Rollin' up the cannabis, hittin' the Mary Jane
Smokin' the five before it's twelve o'clock
Sippin' on Hurricane, ready to smoke on the indo
Rollin' up my window, fittin' to go to the land
With a hand fulla broccoli

When it comes to the sticky, I'm the man
Crunch nasty, I be hittin' the jank so hard I hurl
Fall on the floor fittin' to have a stroke THC ain't no joke
I got five on everything, let's get loaded and smoke

Gonna Find You
And Make you want me

Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates Those who fake, they break,
When they meet their 400 pound mate
If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course, when giddyupin' on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinkin' 'bout the robbery, that I did last week.
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

Where I rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess, lest
I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're Doo Doo
Voo Doo, I can do what you do, easy
Belive me, frontin' niggas give me hee-bee-gee-bees
So while you're imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defacating on your microphone

Ready Or Not, Here I Come

Gonna Find You
And Take it Slowly

You can't run away
From these styles I got,
Oh baby, hey baby
Cause I got a lot, oh yeah
And anywhere you go
My whole crew's gonna know,
Oh baby, hey baby
You can't hide from the block, oh no

Ready or not, refugees takin' over
The Buffalo soldier, dread-lock rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under pushin' up flowers
Superfly true lies, do or die,
Toss me high - only puff la, With my crew from lock high
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes)

Imagine goin' to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruisin' blue behind my waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters

Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feelin' like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got not evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually

Troopin' out of state for a plate knowledge
Of coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion
Designer clothes, lacin' your click up with diamond vogues

Your people holdin' dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind, I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read 'The World Is Mine'

Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be

The way to be, paradise like relaxin' black
Latino an' Anglo-Saxon, Armani exchange the reins
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path

The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes an' Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in

Open they eyes to the lies history's told, foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seein' things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Trickin' six digits on kicks an' still holdin'

Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work, release purple M3's an' jet skis

Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
An' reverse themes to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

If I ruled the world, imagine that

Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?

An' then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin' from jake, gettin' chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state

Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Tryin' to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera
Makin' moves in Atlanta, back an' forth scrambler

'Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga havin' shit
If I ruled the world an' everythin' in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit

What up everybody, so glad you're here

to see if I can get your attention

Now I want to drop some information
just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk

When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
throw your hands up if you're down with the C
double O, L, I, O with the flow

from hood to hood, block to block

Help, I need somebody
to get it goin' on in this party

but don't step on no toes cuz you might get smushed
it's the brother from around the way
and what I say I been comin' on three like Dr. Dre

Comin' at 'em with pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope you don't trip cuz I don't want to have to gat 'em
so move your body baby, drive the homeys crazy,
the way you shake that ass, always amaze me

Ain't no party like a west coast party
cuz a west coast party don't stop
so when you see a young nigga
in a Chevy hittin' switches, then you gotta give the nigga his props

I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to kick the party open

62,Jamiroquai,Cosmic Girl,1996,"I must have died and gone to Heaven
'Cos it was a quarter past eleven
On a Saturday in 1999
Right across on where I'm standing
On a dance floor she was landing
It was clear that she was from another time

Like some baby Barbarella
With the stars as her umbrella
She asked me if I liked to magnetize
Do I have to go star-trekking
'Cos it's you I should be checking
So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes

She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic

I'm scanning all my radars
Well she said she's from a quasar
Forty thousand million light years away
It's a distant solar system
I tried to phone but they don't list 'em
So I asked her for a number all the same

She said, step in my transporter
So I can teleport ya
All around my heavenly body
This could be a close encounter
I should take care not to flounder
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face

She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity

From another galaxy
Transmitting on my frequency
Yeah cosmic, oh
Can't you be my cosmic woman?
I need you, I want you
To be my cosmic girl for the rest of time

Oh, I'm doing my love
Oh, my cosmic girl, yeah

63,Gin Blossoms,Follow You Down,1996,"Did you see the sky, I think it means that we've been lost
Maybe one less time is all we need
I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge, it's just the farthest that I've ever been

Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace, but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far

I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come
But still, I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing and I swear it might be fun
It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone

Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace, but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
Whoooo!

How you gonna ever find your place
Runnin' in an artificial pace
Are they gonna find us lying face down in the sand
So what the hell, have we already been forever damned?

Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace, but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far

When G-dog, the hog, come up in the place
There's dollar signs in your eyes and a smile in your face
You wanna live fat, all for my sack
You got more drag than a low lo-do, cut the act
'Cause back before 92 and 93
You didn't give a damn about Warren G
But now that I'm slingin' platinum LP's
All of a sudden, you on my NUT's
Ain't nothin' you can do to make it stop
'Cause money makes the world go 'round and the panties drop
I ain't in love though, I don't need the pressure
I just wanna dig it like I'm diggin' for treasure
Some of y'all had a good thing that you couldn't keep
Thought you was TLC, you had to creep
You say you had love, I said you bullshit
It's all about the dough, so what's love got to do with it?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
(That's right )
What's love if you don't respect the game?
(Uh huh)
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
If you lack in this game, it's a shame, you won't make it
Now, I'm the type of brother that's down for mines
Before I made beats, I was down to grind
Back then, every single homey had my back
Now they're peepin' my stack and they're talkin' 'bout Jack
But I'm the same brother day in and day out
And I'm-a stay that way until the day I lay out
In a casket it's drastic, 'cause homies is plastic
Break 'em off some bread, they want the whole damn basket
If you's a true homey, you would wish me well
Not plot to make a brother fell, jealous as hell
We used to get the same riches
Now your trigger-finger got the itches, schemin' on my riches
Which is not a suprise, my eyes peep game
211's, 187's it's all the same
It's all a shame, homies'd jack you for your grip
Ain't no love involved, because it's all about the chips

(Uh huh)
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
(That's right)
If you lack in this game, it's a shame, you won't make it
Now for these labels tellin' fables
Makin' them fucked up deals under the tables
You think that you smart, but, fool, I'm the smartest
You can't make no money if you can't keep a artist
Sign the dotted line, put 'em on the shelf
Break 'em off some crumbs, keep the rest for yourself
I know how it goes, treat a artist like you know
Fly cars, gold, clothes but no dough
Since it's all business, I'm-a handle mine
Keep track of my stack down to the very last dime
'Cause in this rap game, it's all about the buck
You bend over for the label and you will get bucked
Like how we run up in the trick and then you're through
The record label do the same thing to you
90 percent business, 10 percent show
Ain't no love in this game, 'cause it's all about the dough
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
(That's right)
What's love if you don't respect the game?
(Uh huh)

Yeah
How do you feel?
Comin' up, as a {nigga} in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

I love the way you
Activate your hips and push your {ass} out
Got a brother wantin' it so bad, I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you
And I can't even lie about it, baby
Just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club
Your hips have got me fiendin'
Body talkin' quick to me
But I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me
Then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway
Catch me if you can
Forgive me

I'm a rider
Still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money plus the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International
Player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, twitch

Get you anything you ask for
Either him or me
The champagne, Hennessey, favorite of my
Homies when we floss, on our enemies
Witness as we
Creep to a low speed, peep, what my foes need
Make some more G's, funk
Ya don't need
Approachin' women with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way

Your body is bangin', baby, I love the way you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, sugar, now tell me how you want it

Tell me, baby
Is it cool to touch?
Tell a man that you can trust
I'm just a fool in lust

Comin' to get you on the bus
It's so ironic
Exotic, on the verge of erotic
I'm hittin' switches on misses like I been fixed with hydraulics
Ma, up and down like a roller coaster

Can I come inside ya
I ain't stoppin' til the show is over
Cause I'm a rider
In and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alize
A livin' legend
You ain't heard about them players livin' Cali days

Instead of tryin' to help a brother, wanna take his G's
Mistaken me for
Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole

To understand the way the game is told
You're lame, so I gotta
Hit you with the hot tracks

Want some on lease?
I'm makin' millions, tryin' to top that
They wanna censor me
They'd rather see me in a cell
Just live in hell
Only a few of us'll live to tell

Heh heh
Now everybody talkin' bout us, I ain't givin' up
The very one that taught us all to cuss
Come on, tell me how you want it

I was raised as a youth

Tell the truth, I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof
Suckers bustin' off the roof
And when I was a teenager
Mobile phone, SkyPager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries

Is gettin' worried

They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetary
They wonder if my lifestyle's changed
And am I through with all the pain
Survivin' in this game
And still the same
Honey, just meet me at the strip club, bring a thong
Look how they shakin' for that cash
Once again, it's on
I have no sympathy for those who afraid of mystery
Come get with me, I promise passion and ecstacy
I'm alone, can I come over
There tonight?
Depend on me, the one to handle it and get it right

Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I had a crush in years

Hey lover

Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way
And I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that'a trip
Still he can't stop me from having day dreams
Tonging you down with  vanilla ice cream

Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searching your body with my tounge girl all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams can turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the isle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead

Hey lover

Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision, it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travellin' the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife no longer my girl

Then you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into a ocean of love we both fell
Swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control

But its a fantasy, you won't come true
We never even spoke and your man still love you
So I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

Hey, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

This is more than a crush
This is more than a crush
This is more than a crush
This is more than a crush"

Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace

Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me be

How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a begger boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be

95,Boyzone,Father & Son,1996,"It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know

Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm, when you've found
Something going on

Take your time, think a lot
Think of everthing you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

How can I try to explain?
When I do, he turns away again
And it's always been the same
Same old story

From the moment I could talk
I was old enough to listen
Now there's a way and I know
That I have to go away I know, I have to go

It's not time to make a change
Just sit down and take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through

Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

All the times, that I've cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
And it's hard
But it's harder to ignore it

If they were right, I'd agree
But it's them they know, not me
Now there's a way and I know that
I have to go away I know, I have to go"

97,The Braids,Bohemian Rhapsody,1996,"Mama just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Mama, life has just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh, I didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
(On, carry on)
Carry on, nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time

Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

No, I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

So you think you can stop and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Ooh, baby, can't do this, baby, just gotta get right out of here
Ooh, baby, can't do this, baby, just gotta get right out of here

On, carry on, nothing really matters
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters to me

who will save your soul
people living their lives for you on tv / they say they're better than you and you agree / another burger, another hot dog, some fries / a wish in the well, hope your health don't go to hell, well / another doctor's bill, another lawyer's bill / another cute cheap thrill / you know you love him if you put him in your will

who will save your soul when it comes to the flower / who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy / who will save your soul if you won't save your own?

we try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them / the cops want someone to bust down on orleans avenue / another day, another dollar, another war, another tower / went up where the homeless had their homes / so we pray to as many different gods as there are flowers / but we call religion our friend / we're so worried about saving our souls / afraid that god will take his toll / that we forget to begin

some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking their kill / you got social security, but that don't pay your bills / there are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay / so you bargain with the devil, say you're o.k. for today / you say that you love them, take their money and run / say, it's been swell, sweetheart / but it was just one of those things / those flings, those strings you've got to cut / so get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts"
