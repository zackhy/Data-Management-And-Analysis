1,Kylie Minogue,Can't Get You Out of My Head,2001,"I just can't get you out of my head, boy
Your lovin is all I think about,
I just can't get you out of my head, boy,
It's more than I dare to think about.
I just can't get you out of my head, boy,
Your lovin is all I think about,
I just can't get you out of my head, boy,
It's more than I dare to think about.

Every night, every day,
Just to be there in your arms.
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
Stay forever and ever and ever and ever.

I just can't get you out of my head, boy,
Your lovin' is all I think about,
I just can't get you out of my head, boy,
It's more than I dare to think about.

There's a dark secret in me,
Don't leave me locked in your heart.
Set me free, feel the need in me, set me free,
Stay forever and ever and ever and ever.

I just can't get you outta my head
I just can't get you outta my head
I just can't get you outta my head"

3,Alicia Keys,Fallin',2001,"I keep on fallin' in
In love with you
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused
I keep on fallin' in and out

Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you
Oh, oh, oh

Never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you

I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you
Oh baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall, fall, fall...
Fall, fall...
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you

I'm fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone

The way that I loved you
I'm fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you"
4,LeAnn Rimes,Can't Fight the Moonlight,2001,"Cannot know, cannot know
Cannot know, cannot know
Cannot know, cannot know
Cannot know
Under a lover's sky
Gonna be with you

And no one's gonna be around
You think that you won't fall
Well, just wait until

Til the sun goes down
Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling so right
It'll steal your heart tonight
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart

But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart
There's no escape from love
Once a gentle breeze
Weaves it's spell upon your heart
No matter what you think
It won't be too long

Til you're in my arms
Underneath the starlight, starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know but you know

That you can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it

No matter what you do
The night is gonna get to you
Cannot know, cannot know

Cannot know, cannot know
Cannot know, cannot know
Don't try, girl, you're never gonna win, oh
Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling so right
It will steal your heart tonight
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know but you know

That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight, no
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight"
5,Shaggy,It Wasn't Me,2001,"Yo man
Yo
Open up man
What do you want man?
My girl just caught me
You let her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen

With who?
The girl next door, you know?

Man...
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key

All this time she was standing there

She never took her eyes off me
How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling on your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer

Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say a night, convince her say a day
Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim

And you tell her baby no way
But she caught me on the counter

(It wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa
(It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower

(It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera

(It wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder
(It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her
(It wasn't me)

Heard the screams getting louder
(It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what she was about to see
Why should she believe me when I told her it wasn't me
Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on
Da right prefix whenever you should see her make da giggolo flex
As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
Seein' is believin' so you better change your specs
You know she not gonna be worrying about things from the past
Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
Your answer: go over there but if she pack a gun
You know you better run fast
But she caught me on the counter
(It wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa
(It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower
(It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera
(It wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder
(It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her
(It wasn't me)
Heard the screams getting louder
(It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
It makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me"

Begged and I pleaded mission completed

Been together so long and this could never be wrong

7,OutKast,Ms Jackson,2001,"Yeah this one right here goes out to all the baby's mamas, mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas, mamas
Yeah, go like this

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood
To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real

Me and yo' daughter, got's this thing going on
(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love
We say it's full grown
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Uh, uh, yeah
""Look at the way he treats me""
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about? Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times"
8,Enrique Iglesias,Hero,2001,"Let me be your hero
Would you dance?
If I asked you to dance?
Would you run?
And never look back?
Would you cry?
If you saw me crying?
And would you save my soul, tonight?
Would you tremble?
If I touched your lips?
Would you laugh?
Oh please tell me this.
Now would you die?
For the one you loved?
Hold me in your arms, tonight.
I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.
Would you swear
That you'll always be mine?
Or would you lie?
Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
I don't care you're here tonight.
I can be your hero, baby.
I can kiss away the pain.
I will stand by you forever.
You can take my breath away.
Oh, I just want to hold you.

9,Jennifer Lopez,Love Don't Cost a Thing,2001,"You think you gotta keep me iced
You don't
You think I'm gonna spend your cash

Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz
I don't
If I wanna floss I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that truck you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But your heart's a mess
Think you outta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matter's is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy yeah

What I need from is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really feel
Doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?

Can substitute the time you take
Take the keys here to my heart
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

Starving for truth

Completely incomplete

I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you

There's nothing else to find
There's nothing in the world
That can change my mind

There is nothing else
There is nothing else

15,Linkin Park,In the End,2001,"It starts with
One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Or wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how

I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised

It got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know

17,Train,Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me),2001,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey 

But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And then you missed me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
 
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey
 
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land
 
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?

And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And then you missed me
While you were looking for yourself out there
 
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?

Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?
 
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?
 
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?

And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And then you missed me
While you were looking for yourself?

And did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?
And did you fall for a shooting star?
Fall for a shooting star?

You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come, come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy, pretty little thing, fierce nipple pierce
You got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side there's nothing that I won't try

Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passing, I'm asking, could this be real
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal

I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the women that I want, so yo, I'm putting it down

Come my lady, come, come my lady

Come my lady, you're my pretty baby

I don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious
Then I guess it's true

But to tell truth I really never knew 'til I met you
I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it
My lifestyles wild, I was living like a wild child

Trapped on a short leash, paroled the police files
And yo, what' s happening now?
I see the sun breaking, shining through dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd

So come my lady, come, come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

Hey sugar momma, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's you like Sid and Nancy

So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' about butterflies in my head
I used to think happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead

You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song
And it's sealed with a kiss and a thank you miss

Come and dance with me, come and dance with me
Come and dance with me, so come and dance with me

I got out of bed at all,
the morning rain
clouds up my window
and I can't see at all.

And even if I could
it'd all be grey
but your picture on my wall,
it reminds me
that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad.

I drank too much last night
got bills to pay
my head just feels in pain,
I missed the bus
and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again.

And even if I'm there,
they'll all imply
that I might not last the day,
and then you call me
and it's not so bad,
it's not so bad.

And I want to thank you
for giving me the best day of my life;
just to be with you
is having the best day of my life.

Push the door I'm home at last
and I'm soaking
through and through
then you handed me
a towel and all I see is you.

And even if my house
falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
because you're near me.

And I want to thank you
for giving me the best day of my life;
just to be with you
is having the best day of my life.

Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me

Frustration baby you gotta breathe
Take alot more that you to get rid of me

Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too

Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same

This perfect romance that I've created in my mind (In my mind)
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when your feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real

And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be (Never be)
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again

I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about (You're about)
A deeper love I've found in you and I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means that you and me were meant to be

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when your feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real, oh yeah

And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (No no)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart, oh yeah

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Baby, ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right (Wrong or right)

into a quiet little place

to find some clever lines to say
to make the meaning come true

35,U2,Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of,2001,"I'm not afraid
Of anything in this world
There's nothing you can throw at me
That I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find
A decent melody
A song that I can sing
In my own company

I never thought you were a fool
But darling, look at you. Ooh.
You gotta stand up straight, carry your own weight
'Cause tears are going nowhere baby

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it

I will not forsake
The colors that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see

You are such a fool
To worry like you do. Oh
I know it's tough
And you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now
My, oh my

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Oh love, look at you now
You've got yourself stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Oh lord look at you now
You've got yourself stuck in a moment
And you cant get out of it

I was unconscious, half asleep
The water is warm 'til you discover how deep
I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall
It's a long way down to nothing at all

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it

And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if your way should falter
Along this stony pass

It's just a moment
This time will pass"

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

It's coming on, it's coming on

It's coming on, it's coming on

Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothin' 'cos I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs and I'm under each snare
Intangible (ah y'all) I bet you didn't think so
I command you to, panoramic view (you)
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes

Picture you getting down and I'll picture too
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional, mystical - maybe
Spiritual hero who appears on you to clear your view (yeah)
When you're too crazy
Lifeless for whose definition is for what life is
Priceless to you because I put ya on the hype shift
Did ya like it?
Gut smokin' righteous but one talkin' psychic
But among knows possess you with one though

It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on

The essence, the basics without it you make it
Allow me to make this child like a nature
Rhythm you have it or you don't
That's a fallacy, I'm in them
Every spiralling tree, every child of peace
Every cloud I see you see with your eyes
You see destruction and demise
(That's right)
Corruption in the skies
From this fucking enterprise that I'm sucked into your lies
The Russell that is muscles
The percussion he provides

For me I say God, y'all can see me now
'Cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the end of it
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rounds of motherfuckers
Remember but the thought is
I brought all this so you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Fearless, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on

It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on

Before the second you turn back

She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a back street guy
I bet her mama never told her why

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man, that's what I am
And when she knows what

She want from her time
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an uptown girl

You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice
Uptown girl, you know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been and then I'll win

And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine
She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world

As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man, that's what I am
Uptown girl, she's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, she's my uptown girl

Eclipse, you elevate my soul

Been living like a mole now
Going down, excavation

I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you can educate my mind

Explain all these controls
Can't sing but I've got soul

Digging up my soul now
Going down, excavation

You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

Love, lift me up out of these blues
Won't you tell me something true?

At first it didn't mean a thing
Then she told me I'm the one that she's searched for
It was hard to believe

She's miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.
House down by the water, sails her yacht across the bay
Drives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene
Loves to be surrounded with superstars that knows her name

In a couple a days she had me a bracelet made
From Harry Winston's place
Went horseback up to the mountaintop
Showing me the land she's got
Well, it's all right, but something else is on your mind
Looking past all that shines, now the tears are running through
All those things are nice, but it's not why I'm here
I will wipe away your tears simply by just loving you, you

62,City High,What Would You Do?,2001,"Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night, was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowin' the cup
About 5, 6 strippers tryin' to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside wit me
Her name was Lonni, she went to Jr. High wit me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last""

She said, ""What would you do if your son was at home
Cryin' all alone on the bedroom floor?
Cuz he's hungry, and the only way to feed him
Is to sleep with a man
For a little bit of money and his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lockdown, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time but for me this is what I call life""

Girl, you ain't the only one wit a baby
That's no excuse to be livin' all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said, ""Every day I wake up hopin' to die""
She said, ""Nigga, I know about pain 'cuz
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager, I done been through more shit
You can't even relate to""

What would you do if your son was at home
Cryin' all alone on the bedroom floor?
'Cuz he's hungry, and the only way to feed him
Is to sleep with a man
For a little bit of money and his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lockdown, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time but for me this is what I call life

{No, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Stop the record, yo, stop the record!
Yo, Shorty, you ain't gotta be goin' out like this, man!
Holdup!}

What would you do?
Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
What would you do?
'Cuz I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through
Come on, what would you do?
Get up on my feet and stop makin' up tired excuses
What would you do?
Girl, I know if my mother can do it, baby, you can do it

What would you do if your son was at home
Cryin' all alone on the bedroom floor?
Cuz he's hungry, and the only way to feed him
Is to sleep with a man
For a little bit of money and his daddy's gone

63,Madonna,What it Feels Like For a Girl,2001,"Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots 'cause it's okay to be a boy

But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading

But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you? What it feels like for a girl

Silky smooth, lips as sweet as candy
Baby, tight blue jeans, skin that shows in patches

Strong inside but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it

When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl?

Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently
Baby, hands that rest on jutting hips repenting

Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows

When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world?
What it feels like for a girl

Strong inside but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it

When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl?
In this world

Do you know? Do you know?
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
What it feels like in this world"

When he makes me weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase
But I cant stop fanning the fire

I know I meant to say no

But he's irresistible, up close and personal
Now inescapable, I can hardly breathe
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful and irresistible to me, I can hardly breathe

Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I can't stop myself from falling
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't want to play no game
'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me

I know meant to say no

But he's irresistible, up close and personal
Now inescapable, I can hardly breathe
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful and irresistible to me

Can't you see whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe?
He's so irresistible

His kisses are powerful
He's so irresistible

And still this question keeps on spinning in my mind

What if I had never let you go?
Would you be the man I used to know?
If I'd stayed, if you'd tried
If we could only turn back time
But I guess we'll never know

Many roads to take
Some to joy, some to heart-ache
Anyone can lose their way

And if I said that we could turn it back
Right back to the start
Would you take the chance and make the change?

Do you think how it would have been sometimes?
Do you pray that I'd never left your side?

What if I had never let you go?
Would you be the man I used to know?
If I'd stayed, if you'd tried
If we could only turn back time
But I guess we'll never know

If only we could turn the hands of time
If I could take you back would you still be mine

'Cos I tried, but I had to draw the line
And still this question keeps on spinning in my mind

What if I had never let you go?
Would you be the man I used to know?
What if I had never walked away?
'Cos I still love you more than I can say?

78,Depeche Mode,Dream On,2001,"As bony fingers close around me long and spindly death becomes me
Heaven can you see what I see
Hey you pale and sickly child you're death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile

Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're giving

Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?
Dream on dream on

There's no time for hesitating pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it's educating
Unwanted, uninvited kin it creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without it lives within you

Feel the fever coming
You're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won't stop you itching

Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?
Dream on dream on

Blame it on your karmic curse or shame upon the Universe
It knows its lines it's well rehearsed
It sucked you in it dragged you down to where there is no hallow ground
Where holiness is never found

Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you

Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances but they're worth taking
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth making

Don't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

Then picked a star before we lost
The moon, youth is wasted on the young
Before you know it's come and gone too soon

99,Gabrielle,Out of Reach,2001,"Knew the signs
Wasn't right
I was stupid for a while
Swept away by you
And now I feel like a fool
So confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?

Out of reach, so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be

Catch myself
From despair
I could drown
If I stay here
Keeping busy everyday
I know I will be OK

But I was
So confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?

Out of reach, so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be

So much hurt
So much pain
Takes a while
To regain
What is lost inside
And I hope that in time
You'll be out of my mind
And I'll be over you

But now I'm
So confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?

Out of reach, so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be
Out of reach
So far
You never gave your heart
In my reach, I can see
There's a life out there
For me"
100,Incubus,Drive,2001,"Sometimes, I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear
Take the wheel and steer

It's driven me before and seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes yea
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there I'll be there

So, if I decide to waiver my chance
To be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?
Aah ah ooo

It's driven me before and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that when
I drive myself my light is found

Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes yea
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there I'll be there

Would you choose water over wine?
Hold the wheel and drive

Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes yea
Whatever tomorrow brings
I'll be there I'll be there"
