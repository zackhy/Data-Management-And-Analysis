1,Phil Collins,A Groovy Kind of Love,1988,"When I'm feeling blue all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me I can feel your heart beat
I can hear you breathing in my ear

Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
Got a groovy kind of love

Anytime you want to you can turn me into
Anything you want to anytime at all
When I kiss your lips oh I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside

Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
Got a groovy kind of love

When I'm feeling blue all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your eyes nothing seems to matter
My whole world could shadow I don't care

Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
Got a groovy kind of love

We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love"
2,Bobby McFerrin,Don't Worry Be Happy,1988,"Here's a little song I wrote you might want to sing it note for note

3,U2,Desire,1988,"Lover, I'm on the street
Gonna go where the bright lights
And the big city meet
With a red guitar on fire

Desire

She's a candle
Burning in my room
I'm like the needle, needle and spoon

Over the counter with a shotgun
Pretty soon, everybody got one
And the fever when I'm beside her

Desire
Desire

And the fever getting higher
Desire, desire, burning, burning

She's the dollars, she's my protection
Yeah, she's a promise in the year of election
Oh sister, I can't let you go

Like a preacher
Stealing hearts at a traveling show
For love or money, money, money

And the fever getting higher
Desire, desire, desire, desire

Desire
Desire"

6,Tiffany,I Think We're Alone Now,1988,"Children behave
That's what they say when we're together
And watch how you play
They don't understand

And so we're...
Running just as fast as we can
Holdin' on to one another's hand

Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

Look at the way
We gotta hide what we're doin'

Cuz what would they say
If they ever knew
And so we're
Running just as fast as we can

Holdin' on to one another's hand
Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground

And then you say
I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around

I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
I think we're alone now

It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue

Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

When the night falls down

I wait for you and you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids on the street outside
When you walk into the room

You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinnin' with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?

Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
When I feel alone

I reach for you and you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea
I hear your voice and it carries me
In this world we're just beginning

To understand the miracle of living
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?

Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth

10,Kylie Minogue,I Should Be So Lucky,1988,"In my imagination there is no complication
I dream about you all the time
In my mind a celebration, the sweetest of sensation
Thinking you could be mine

In my imagination there is no hesitation
We walk together hand in hand
I'm dreaming, you fell in love with me like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do if only they'd come true

I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love
I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love

It's a crazy situation, you always keep me waiting
Because it's only make believe
And I would come a-running to give you all my loving
If one day you would notice me

My heart is close to breaking and I can't go on faking
The fantasy that you'll be mine
I'm dreaming that you're in love with me like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do if only they'd come true

I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love
I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love

I should be so lucky
I should be so lucky, I
I should be so lucky
I should be so lucky, I

In my imagination there is no hesitation
We walk together hand in hand
I'm dreaming like you're in love with me, like I'm in love with you

11,The Beach Boys,Kokomo,1988,"Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don't we go
Jamaica

Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go to get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don't we go

Ooo I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo
To Martinique, that Monserrat mystique

We'll put out to sea
And we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy a little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don't we go

Ooo I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo
Port Au Prince I wanna catch a glimpse

Everybody knows
A little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go
And get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don't we go

Ooo I wanna take you down to Kokomo

12,Phil Collins,Two Hearts,1988,"Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
'Cos it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
'Cos she's always there to behind you, just to remind you

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

Well, there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

She knows
There'll always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah, she knows
No matter how far apart we are
She knows, I'm always right there beside her

And we're two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
We're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time"
13,George Michael,One More Try,1988,"I've had enough of danger and people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels, just trying to find some peace
I think it's time that you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't just let me go

'Cause teacher, there are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you
Touch you, think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger and I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger, now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes, telling me no
So you think that you love me, know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong, just let me go

And teacher, there are things that I don't want to learn
Oh the last one I had made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you
Touch you, think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher, there are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh so I don't want to hold you
Touch you, think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try

I'm so cold
Inside
Maybe just one more try"
14,Milli Vanilli,"Girl, You Know It's True",1988,"I'm in love with you, girl, that's on my mind
You're the one I think about 'lmost every time
The way you pack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true?
You're soft, succulent, so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together we're one, separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality, you that I admire
To put it plain and simple,
you rule my world
so try to understand

I'm in love, girl
I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love, girl,

Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions start up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet, sweet voice would ring in my ears
Stimulates my system when you are near
With your positive emotions, laughs make you jump
You don't need to fuss, girl or boy
These feelings I get, I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you wear, I don't care, and if you fussed before
The reason that I like you, girl, for what you are
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand

I'm in love, girl
I'm in so love, girl
I'm just in love girl,
and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you

Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

I'm in love with you, girl
I'm in love with you, girl
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you"

Maybe I didn't treat you 
quite as good as I should 
Maybe I didn't love you
quite as often as I could
Little things I should've said and done, 
I never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind.
Maybe I didn't hold you
all those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you,
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best,
I'm so sorry, I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind.
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
Keep you Satisfied

18,Rick Astley,Together Forever,1988,"If there's anything you need
All you have to do is say
Don't you satisfy everything in me
We shouldn't waste a single day

So don't stop me falling
It's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing
Can't you hear me? I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life

Together forever and never to past
Together forever, we two
And don't you know I would move Heaven and Earth
To be together forever with you

If they ever get you down
There's always something I can do
Because I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown
I'll always do what's best for you

There ain't no mistaking
It's true love we're making
Something to last for all time
It's never changing
Can't you hear me? I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life

Together forever and never to past
Together forever, we two
And don't you know I would move Heaven and Earth
To be together forever with you

19,Tracy Chapman,Fast Car,1988,"You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere

Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we’ll make something
But me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won’t have to drive too far
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
finally see what it means to be living

See my old man’s got a problem
He live with the bottle that’s the way it is
He says his body’s too old for working
his body’s too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody’s got to take care of him
So I quit school and that’s what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

so I remember when we were driving,driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I,I had a feeling that I belonged
And I,I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain’t got a job
And I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You’ll find work and I’ll get promoted
We’ll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving,driving in your car
speed so fast It felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I,I had a feeling that I belonged
And I,I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking till late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I’d always hoped for better
But maybe together you and me'd find it
If you got no plans and ain’t going nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I,I had a feeling that I belonged
And I,I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so you can fly away
You gotta make a decision
You leave tonight or live and die this way"

21,Whitney Houston,One Moment in Time,1988,"Each day I live, I want to be
A day to give the best of me
I'm only one, but not alone
My finest day is yet unknown

I broke my heart for every gain
To taste the sweet, I faced the pain
I rise and fall, yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heart beat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel, I will feel eternity

I've lived to be the very best
I want it all, no time for less
I've laid the plans, now lay the chance
Here in my hands

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heart beat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel, I will feel eternity

You're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time, make it shine

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heart beat away
And the answers are all up to me

27,Taylor Dayne,Tell it to My Heart,1988,"I feel the night explode
When we're together
Emotion overload
In the heat of pleasure

Take me I'm yours
Into your arms
Never let me go
Tonight I really need to know

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

The passion's so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
The message you're sending

Body to body
Soul to soul
Always feel you near
So say the words I long to hear

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Love, love on the run
Breakin' us down
Though we keep holdin' on
I don't want to lose
No, I can't let you go

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the start
Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the start
Tell it to my heart
Never make it stop
Oh, take it to the heart

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name
Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart"
28,George Michael,Father Figure,1988,"That's all I wanted
Something special something sacred in your eyes
For just one moment to be bold and naked at your side
Sometimes I think that you never understand me (understand me)
Maybe this time is forever say it can be
W-h-o-a...
That's all you wanted
Something special someone sacred in your life
Just for one moment to be warm and naked at my side

Sometimes I think that you never understand me (understand me)
But something tells me together we'd be happy
W-h-o-a baby
I will be your father figure
Oh baby

Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Be your daddy
Anything you have in mind

I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
Except me
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time
Do it do it do it do it oh baby
That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken for a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's blue eyes shine
This time I think that my lover understands me
(understands me)
If we have faith in each other then we can be strong baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
My baby

I will be your preacher teacher

Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time
If you are the desert I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger hunger for me
Whatever you ask for that's what I'll be
So when you remember the ones who have lied

Who said that they cared but then laughed as you cried

Beautiful darling don't think of me...
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes baby-baby-baby
And love can't lie no
Greet me with the eyes of a child
My love is always telling me so
(heaven is a kiss and a smile)
Just hold on hold on
Won't let you go my baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mine baby
I will be your father figure

I have had enough of crime

So I am gonna love you 'til the end of time
I will be your father
I will be your...
I will be your preacher

I'll be your daddy
W-h-o-a
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time..."

Didn't mean a thing
I guess our song is over
As we begin to sing

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day of my life
Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
I'll never hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

The memories of our lovin'
Still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
They stay with me everywhere

Every time I get my hopes up
They always seem to fall
Still what could've been is better than
What could never be at all

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day of my life
Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
You can hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
How could you hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night?"

And I never meant to hurt my baby oh so much
'Cos I love her and I think she love me
And that's the way it's got to be

When we're together we never fight
We've got better things to do tonight

Forty seven dead beats living in the back street
north east west south all in the same house
sitting in a back room waiting for the big boom
I'm in a bedroom waitng for my baby

She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild wild hair
dance to the beat that we love best
heading for the nineties
living in the wild wild west

Mandy's in the backroom handing out valium
sheriff's on the airwaves talking to the D.J.'s
Forty seven heartbeats beating like a drum

33,Michael Jackson,Man in the Mirror,1988,"I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right...
As I, turn up the collar on my
Favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on
The wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

A better place
Take a look at yourself
And then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed - out dream
(Washed - out dream)
They follow the pattern of
The wind, ya' see
Cause they got no place to be

34,The Pet Shop Boys,Domino Dancing,1988,"Come outside and see a brand new day
The troubles in your mind will blow away
It's easy to believe they're here to stay
But you won't find them standing in your way

* Se a vida e I love you
Come outside and feel the morning sun
Se a vida e I love you
Life is much more simple when you're young
Come on essa vida e
That's the way life is
That's the way life is*

Although we see the world through different eyes
We share the same idea of paradise
So don't search in the stars for signs of love
Look around your life you'll find enough

Why do you want to sit alone in gothic gloom
surrounded by the ghost of love that haunt your room?
Somewhere there's a different door to open wide
You gotta throw those skeletons out of your closet and come outside

So you will see a brand new day
The troubles in your mind will blow away
It's easy to believe they're here to stay
but you won't find them standing in your way"

First time, first love
Oh what feeling is this
Electricity flows
With the very first kiss
Like a break in the clouds
And the first ray of sun
I can feel it inside
Something new has begun
And it's taking control
Of my body and mind
It began when I heard I love you

For the very first time
For the very first time
For the very first time
For the very first time

In control, in control
My body control
My body control
I can feel it
And it's in control
My body control

I can feel...

This life, this love
All the sweetness I feel
So mysterious yet
So incredibly real
It's an uncharted sea
It's an unopened door
But you gotta reach out
And you gotta explore
Even though you're not sure
Till the moment arrives
There he is and you know you're in love

Can't see through this veil across my heart, over you

The trend is irreversible
The woman is invincible

She's a natural law and she leaves me in awe
She deserves the applause, I surrender because
She used to look good to me but now I find her

Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible

Simply irresistible, she's so fine
There's no telling where the money went
Simply irresistible she's all mine
There's no other way to go

She's unavoidable I'm backed against the wall
She gives me feelings like I never felt before
I'm breaking promises, she's breaking every law
She used to look good to me but now I find her

Simply irresistible

She's so fine
There's no telling where the money went
Simply irresistible, she's all mine
There's no other way to go

Her methods are inscrutable
The proof is irrefutable
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She's so completely kissable, huh
Our lives are indivisible

She's a craze you'd endorse, she's a powerful force
You're obliged to conform when there's no other course
She used to look good to me but now I find her

Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible

She's so fine
There's no telling where the money went
Simply irresistible she's all mine
There's no other way to go

She's so fine
There's no telling where the money went
Simply irresistible she's all mine
There's no other way to go

48,Taylor Dayne,I Will Always Love You,1988,We do not have the lyrics for I Will Always Love You (Karaoke Version) [In the Style of Taylor Dayne] yet.
49,Kim Wilde,You Came,1988,"Someone I know is staring at me
And when I look into her eyes
I see a girl that I used to be
I hardly recognise
Cos in the space of a year
I've watched the old me disappear
All of the things I once held precious
Just don't mean anything anymore
Cos suddenly

You came, and changed the way I feel
No one could love you more
Because you came and turned my life around

No one could take your place

I've never felt good with permanent things
Now I don't want anything to change
You can't imagine the joy you bring
My life won't be the same
And I'll be there when you call
I'll pick you up if you should fall

Cos I have never felt such inspiration
Nobody else ever gave me more because

You came, and changed the way I feel

No one could love you more
Because you came and turned my life around
No one could take your place

You came
You came, turned my life around
No one could take your place
I watch you sleep in the still of the night
You look so pretty when you dream
So many people just go through life
Holding back, they don't say what they mean
But it's easy for me
Since you came
No one could love you more
Because you came and turned my life around
No one could take your place
You came
And you turned my life around
And you came and turned my life around
No one could take your place"
50,Fat Boys & ,The Twist (Yo Twist),1988,"Hee hee hee hee, twist, ahh, we're back

Come on, baby, let's do the twist, come on, baby, let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand and go like this

The party was packed, I'm talking back to back
There was a rapper that was rapping to a beat that was wack
They was going through the motions out on the dance floor
And when the rapper was done, they wasn't yelling encore
The people were tired of the same old groove
They wanted something def, something new and improved
Something easy to do but hard to resist
""I got something for y'all, what do you call it the twist""

Come on, baby, let's do the twist
Chubby Checker and The Fat Boys, we're doing the twist
Take us by our little hand and go like this

We, we, we broke into the booth and the record stacks
Came up with ""The Twist"" and we were scratching the track
People started jamming hard to the funky sound
Did the twist down and up, then up and down
Then I heard somebody yell, yo, Chubby's here
The people took a little pause, just to stop and stare
He said ""I'll show you people, how to twist with style
Cause I've been doing the twist for a long, long while""

Oh, you should see Prince Markie Dee
Check out that Kool Rock, he's rocking like me
Here comes B-Beat Box, come on, do it, Buffy

Come on, baby, come, come, come, come, come on, baby
Do, do, do, do the twist, do, do, do, do the twist

Come on, baby, let's do the twist
Chub and the Fat Boys, we're doing the twist
Take the world by the hand and do the twist

Chubby took my sister down to the dance floor
Did the twist so def, the crowd yelled for more
So I Ponyed with my mother, did the Fly with my goil
And when Buff did the Limbo, we was rocking the world

Come on, baby, let's do the twist
Chubby Checker and the Fat Boys, we're doing the twist
Take the world by the hand and go like this
Hey, the West coast and on the East coast
And in the South, and in the North
And all over the world, what time is it?
Come on, baby (Twist to the left, twist to the right)
Let's do the twist (Twist up and down, twist all night)
Chubby Checker (Come on, come on)
And the Fat Boys (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
We're doing the twist (Come on, come on, come on)
Take us by our little hands and go like this
Oh, yeah, and do the twist, yeah, just like me
Ooh, yeah, and do the twist, oh, yeah."

Still I can't figure what went wrong
I'd still do anything for you

I'll play your game

That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me crying
You know inside I feel like dying
And I'd do anything for you

In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong
But don't you ever think that I don't love you

That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye
I hope you find someone to please you

Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to
And I'd do anything for you

I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy
I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me crying
Don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye"

There is a new place

It started the day when I left you

I could never love again the way I loved you
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh, the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart

I could never love again now that we're apart

When I was sorry
It was too late to turn around and tell you so

There was no reason, there was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart

I could never cry again like I did when I left you

Just left me beside myself without your heart

Don't you see the tears are falling down my face, since you went away
Break my heart, you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong never meant to hurt you now you're gone

57,George Michael,Kissing a Fool,1988,"You are far, when I could have been your star
You listened to people, who scares you to death
And from my heart
Strange that you were strong enough to even make a start
But you'll never find peace of mind, till you listen to your heart

People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will, for they will
If you let them steal your heart from you
People, will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So goodbye
But please don't take my heart

You are far, I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough, I don't know where to start
But I'll never find peace of mind while I listen to my heart

People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will, for they will
If you let them steal off your heart
And people, will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all

But remember this, every other kiss that you'll ever give
Long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you, like I always do
But something there that can't compare with any other

You are far, when I could have been your star
You listened to people, who scared you to death
And from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough to think you'd love me too
I guess you were kissing a fool
You must have been kissing a fool"

I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high post but you play me close
And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast
Girl, I work so hard for you from 9 to 5
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied
Ohhhh, girl
As long as I've been giving my heart to you
You should be giving me your heart too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool
Don't be cruel
Cuz' I would never be that cruel to you
Oh no, oh oh nooo
Don't be cruel
Girl you need to change your attitude
Oh no, oh
Don't be cruel
From,
Fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you 12 yellow roses and candy too
I like to be up front, and never play the back
But the way you treat me girl it's like a heart attack
I'm a real troop-trooper aiming for the top
And with you by my side big dollars I'll clock
Ohhhh, girl
As long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool
It just ain't cool
Don't be cruel...
Oh no, oh
We used to hang out tough
Just kickin' around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find
Although I want you bad, I can let you go
Cuz' there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
Roll to the fact that I want you Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see
But you had to start illin', tryin' to make a killin'
Though about the dollars I make,
And you were willin'
To be with me, Bobby B.
But with a bad attitude I can't compete
Now you know my name, now I know your game
You wanna be with me,
You gotta be the same way that another girl would be
And if you wanna be with me
Don't be cruel
(Don't be, don't be)
Cuz' I would never be that cruel to you
(Don't be, don't be)..."

They talk about me and they'll talk about you
Something happens to the pledges of trust
Down through the years they begin to rust

Now here we are amid the tears and the laughter
Still waiting for our happily ever after
We'll keep on dreamin' as long as we can
Try to remember and you'll understand

Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but, oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion, yeah
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you

I cry just a little when he plays piano in the dark

He plays a melody, born to tear me all apart

I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
  (I promise you)
But if you wait around a while I'll make you fall for me
  (I promise you)
I promise, I promise you, I will

When your day is through
And so is your temper
You know what to do
I'm gonna always be there

Sometimes if I shout
It's not what's intended
These words just come out
With no cross to bear

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
  (I promise you)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
  (I promise you)
But if you wait around a while I'll make you fall for me
  (I promise you)
I promise, I promise you

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
  (I promise you)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
  (I promise you)
And if I had to walk the world I'd make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will

Gotta tell you
Need to tell you
Gotta tell you
I've gotta tell you

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
  (I promise you)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
  (I promise you)
But if you wait around a while I'll make you fall for me
  (I promise you)
I promise, I promise you

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
  (I promise you)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
  (I promise you)
And if I had to walk the world I'd make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will
I will, I will"
98,Rod Stewart,Forever Young,1988,"May the good Lord be with you, down every road you roam
And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you're far from home
And may you grow to be proud dignified and true
And do unto others as you'd have done to you
Be courageous and be brave and in my heart you'll always stay

Forever young
Forever young

May good fortune be with you, may your guiding light be strong
Build a stairway to heaven with a prince or a vagabond
And may you never love in vain and in my heart you will always remain

Forever young
Forever young

Forever young
Forever young
Forever young

And when you finally fly away, I'll be hoping that I served you well
For all the wisdom of a lifetime no one can ever tell
But whatever road you choose, I'm right behind you, win or lose

Forever young
Forever young

Forever young
Forever young

Put A Little Love In Your Heart
Annie Lennox & Al Green

Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart

You see it's getting late
Oh please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see

Another day goes by
And still the children cry
Put a little love in you heart
If you want the world to know
We won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see
Wait and see

Take a good look around
And if you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide
Kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your
Love in your heart

100,Gipsy Kings,Bamboleo,1988,"Ese amor llega asi de esta manera
No tiene la culpa
Caballo de danza vana
Porque es muy despreciado por eso
No te perdona llorar

Ese amor llega asi esta manera
No tiene la culpa
Amor de compra y venta
Amor de en el pasado

Bem, bem bem bem, bem bem bem
Bem, bem bem bem, bem bem bem

Bamboleo bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi
Bamboleo bambolea
Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi

No tienes perden de Dios
Tu eres mi vida la fortuna del destino
En el destino del desamparado
Lo mismo ya que ayer
Lo mismo soy yo

No te encuentro l'abandon
Eres imposible no te encuentro de verdad
Por eso un dia no encuentro si de nada
Lo mismo ya que ayer
Lo pienso en ti
