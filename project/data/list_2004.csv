Yeah, okay, Usher, a Lil' Jon
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, let's go

In the club with my homies tryin' to get a little V-I
Keep it down on the low key 'cause you know how it feels
I saw Shorty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' in my ear
Thank that she knew me, so we decided to chill

Conversation got heavy
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
Watch out, oh, watch out, she's sayin', ""Come get me""
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, ""Baby lets go"", when I told her, I said

Yeah yeah, Shorty got down, sayin', ""Come and get me""
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew, she was all up on me screamin'

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

So she's all up in my head now, got me thinkin'
That it might be a good idea to take her with me
'Cause she's ready to leave but I gotta keep it real now
'Cause on a one-to-ten she's a certified twenty but that just ain't me, hey

'Cause I don't know if I take that chance, just where it's gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Makes Shorty alright with me, the way she gettin' low
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She asked for one more dance and I'm like, yeah
""How the hell am I supposed to leave"" and I said

Yeah yeah, Shorty got down, sayin', ""Come and get me""
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew, she was all up on me screamin'

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

Ludaa, watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And wow! These women all on the prowl
If ya hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow

And forget about the game, I'm spit the truth
I won't stop till I get 'em in their birthday suits
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
So bend over to the front and touch your toes

I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin' then I put 'em on foot patrol, ooh, aow
How ya like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand

Let's drank you to one to please
Ludacris, fill cups like double D's
Me and Ush once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say

Yeah yeah, Shorty got down, sayin', ""Come and get me""
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew, she was all up on me screamin'

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

Take that and rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go
Take that, rewind it back, Usher got the voice to make your booty go
Take that, rewind it back, Ludacris got the flow to make your booty go
Take that, rewind it back, Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go"

To put it on me deep in the right direction

OOOh
You understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you

5,Eminem,Just Lose It,2004,"Down, down, down!

Okay,
Guess who's back?
Back again.
Shady's back,
tell a friend

Now everyone report to the dance floor

Alright stop,
pajama time.
Come here little kiddies, on my lap.
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusates
Ah ah ah ah ah,
No worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor,
I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide

Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung hole

And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's okay
(Poot)
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance,
it's your chance

Yeah boy, shake that ass,
whoops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl you know you're my world,

It's Friday
And it's my day
Used to party

All the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday,
I don't know what day
Everyday's just a holiday

Cruisin' on the freeway,
feelin' kind of breezy
Get the top down, lettin' my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin',

all I know is when I get there someone's gonna
Touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?

Spit on me,
maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's ya name girl, what's ya sign?
Man you must be up out yo mind
Dre, ah, ah, beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

Man, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt naked
Down the street screamin' ""Ah ah ah ah""
Well I'm sorry,
I don't remember
All I know is this much,
I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body""
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It's real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's '8 Mile' now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit
Oh you signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba
I don't have any lines to go right here so tubba Tellytubby fellas,
(what?)
Fellas. (what?) Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous
(What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm callin' all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for
a little romance or
butt squeezin'
It's my season,

6,D12,My Band,2004,"I don't know dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'Cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everybody's got a fuckin problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right, drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
""Waasup ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12 baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God it's him!
Becky oh my fucking God! It's Eminem!
I swear to fucking God, dude you fucking rock!
Please, won't you please, let me suck your cock?""

And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Specially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry

'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're trying to steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

My band my band my band my band
My band my band my band my band
My band baby

You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on proto?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, youse a liar
And no I'm Swift oh I thought you were Kuniva
What the hell is wrong with our dressing room?

'Cause our shit is lookin smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doing jumpin jacks whiling get whipped on my back
Look at 'em little punk ass thinking he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No I had an interview, not you two

You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't gonna soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man, I'm a say something
You got somethin to say?
Man nothing I thought you 'bout to tell him off man, what's up?
Man I'm a tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be a crew
Man I was bout to talk right after you, I swear
Man whatever I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to the amusement parks
I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear,""Hey dude I love your band""
We ain't a band bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get ninty and we only get ten percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
Proof carry my bag, bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?

Goddamn it, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artis slipped me some crack
'Lose yourself' video, I was in the back
'Superman' video, I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall! Ask us the questions

Like who's D12? How we get started?
But what about Eminem?
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute, ""Hey sexy!""
Fifty told me to do situps to get buff
Did two and a half and then couldn't get up
Fuck D12! I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

Girl why cant you see you're the only one for me?
And it just tears my ass apart to know
That you don't know my name man fuck this!

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands, fuck Marshall
'Cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

My band my band my band my band
My band my band my band my band
My band baby
The hottest boy band in the world D12!

I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
And the lead singer of my band, my Salsa
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My Salsa, look out for my next single it's called ""My Salsa""
My Salsa, Salsa, Salsa, Salsa, my Salsa
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants

13,Evanescence,My Immortal,2004,"I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time can not erase

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time can not erase
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Me...
Me..."

You in my dreams
I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

I make-believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

Please, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry

At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away

Recited it over a Hip-Hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean

With dead poets and drum machines
You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find a killer book

Now you've gone & raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes

23,Band Aid 20,Do They Know It's Christmas?,2004,"It's Christmas time there's no need to be afraid At Christmas time – we let in light and we banish shade And in our world of plenty we can spread our smile of joy
Feel your arms around the world at Christmas time
But say a prayer and pray for the other ones
At Christmas time its hard but while you're having fun
There's a world outside your window and it's a world of dread and fear
Where a kiss of love can kill you
Where there's death in every tear
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight we're reaching out and touching you
Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa
A song of hope where there's no hope tonight (ooh)
Why is comfort to be feared, Why is to touch to be scared
How can they know it's Christmas time at all
Here's to you
Raise a glass to everyone
Here's to them
And all there is to come
Can they know it's Christmas time at all
Feed the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Feel the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Feel the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Heal the world let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world let them know it's Christmas time again

And the darkness is a clear view
Cuz you've come to rescue me

Fall... With you, I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts

It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels

It's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody, messy
I get restless, and it's senseless
How you never seem to care

When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy it's your mission
And you won't stop til I'm there

Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom
Crash, you're all I have

It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels

It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know everything I'm about to say?
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face...
I hope it never goes away... yeah

On a Monday, I am waiting
And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms...

Lord help me get away
Cause only you can save me now
From this misery
Cause I've been lost in my own place
And I'm getting' weary
How far is heaven
And I know I need to change
My ways of livin'
How far is heaven, Lord can you tell me

I've been locked up way too long
In this crazy world, how far is heaven
And I just keep on prayin' Lord
Just keep on livin', how far is heaven
Lord can you tell me, how far is heaven
I just got to know how far, how far is heaven
Lord can you tell me

Tu que estas en alto cielo,
Echame tu bendiciòn

Cause I know there's a better place
Than this place I'm livin', how far is heaven
So I just got to show some faith
And just keep on giving, how far is heaven

I just wanna know how far, how far is heaven,
Lord can you tell me, how far is heaven,
'cause I just gotta know how far,
I just wanna know far"

I think it's amazing, I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing

Said, ""Darling, kiss as many as you want
My love's still available and I know you're insatiable""

Look at your Big Bad Daddy and your mom
And your mom was always acting crazy

72,The Streets,Dry Your Eyes,2004,"In one single moment, your whole life can turn round
I stand there for a minute, staring straight into the ground
Looking to the left slightly, then looking back down
The world feels like it's caved in, proper sorry frown

Please let me show you where we could only just be for us
I can change, and I can grow, or we could adjust
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
We can even have an open relationship if you must

I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me
But her eyes glaze over, like she's looking straight through me
Her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
When they open up she's looking down at her feet

Dry your eyes mate
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

So then I move my hand up and down by my side
It's shaking; my life is crashing before my eyes
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies
Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh

'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me
There's things I can't imagine doing
Things I can't imagine seeing
It weren't supposed to be easy, surely
Please, please, I'm begging, please

She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested
She wraps her fingers around mine with the softness she's blessed with
She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures
By pushing my hand away to my chest, from hers

Dry your eyes mate
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

And I'm just standing there
I can't say a word
Because everything is just gone
I've got nothing
Absolutely nothing

Trying to pull her close out of bear desperation
Put my arms around her, trying to change what she's saying
Pull my head level with hers so that she might engage in
Look in to her eyes to make her listen again

I'm not gonna fucking just fucking leave it all now
'Cause you said it'd be forever, and that was your vow
And your gonna let our things simply crash and fall down
You're well out of order now, this is well out of town

She pulls away my arms, tightly clamped round her waist
Gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face
Takes one step forward, looks back, then walks away

Dry your eyes mate
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

I know in the past I've found it hard to say
Telling you things, but not telling straight
But the more I pull on your hand and say
The more you pull away

I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up

92,D12,How Come,2004,"So I changed huh?
You got a phone, pick it up, call me

How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

We were so young, so full of life and vivrance side by side
Wherever you was ridin' I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side with a shoulder to cry on
A tissue to wipe my eyes,
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succumb to yours?

And mine I survived it, you ran the streets, I 9 to 5'd it
We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then I blew up
To both yours and mine surprises
Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it
As much as your pride tries to hide it
Your cold to touch it's just like ice
In your eyes is the look of resentment
I can sense it, and I don't like it

How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

It was my dream at first to be on spittin' a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
So I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
Before I let him disrespect me and check me over some worst
Some bitch that I wasn't with I would hit her then quit
But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved wit her, you was smokin' the chron with her
Comin' out of the bar with her stumblin' half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or somethin'

But me catchin' her fuckin' other niggers
Must've hurt you pride or somethin'
'Cuz you went off at the mouth with people like you wanted with me
When all I tried to do was show your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You actin' like I ain't ya man and lyin' like she can't be loose
But I am really you friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth
Don't hate the game or the player
The one that is changing is you

How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

Its gettin' only at the top 'cuz my homie had to stop
Now we actin' like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch get to speakin' all rude
Fools I used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snappin and 'poof' it just happen
But Proof is just actin' out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my baby's ain't starvin' at home

See the devil in your grin since the ghetto we been friends
Forever real intelligence thats forever till the end
I keep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wastin' my times with these snakes in disguise
How come, when you talk its with bitter respite?
And how come, it's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you and play you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face

How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true
