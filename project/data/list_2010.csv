2,Bruno Mars,Just the Way You Are,2010,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say...

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile

The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me

Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say...

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change

'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are... yeah..."
3,Katy Perry,California Gurls,2010,"Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey.

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (and then)
Boys break their necks
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world,
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oooh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo
Oh oh

Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (ah)

The girl's a freak
She drives a Jeep
In Laguna Beach

I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love LA,
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summer time is everything

Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, tankinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie

4,Katy Perry,Firework,2010,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag?
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin?
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a wasted space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

7,Katy Perry,Teenage Dream,2010,"You think I'm pretty
Without any make-up on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down, down

Before you meet me
I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my valentine, valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me
Feel like
I'm living a Teenage Dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and
Built a floor out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I
We'll be young forever

You make me
Feel like
I'm living a Teenage Dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I might get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

You make me
Feel like
I'm living a Teenage Dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away
And don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops

11,BoB & Hayley Williams,Airplanes,2010,"Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now

I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
Cause after all the partying and smashing and crashing
And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time when you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at the phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane airplane sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and
I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now

Yeah somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah back when I was trying to get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rapping for the hell of it
But nowadays we rapping to stay relevant
I'm guessing that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I'd go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur what's up Bobby Ray
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hoping we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, a wish right now, a wish right now

I could really use a wish right now
I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shootin stars
I could really use a wish right now
A wish a wish right now"

I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

You see, I can be myself now finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be

22,Eminem,Not afraid,2010,"Yeah, It's been a ride...
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehhhh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road"

Tryin' to get my Usher on but I can't let it burn

For, moreover, I miss her, when will I learn?

Didn't give her all my love, guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club, thinkin' all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough

I'm goin' through it every time that I'm alone
And now I miss her and wishin' she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gonna be
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream

So I traveled back down that road
Wish she'd come back, no one knows
I realized, yeah
It was only just a dream

And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

43,Taylor Swift,Mine,2010,"You were in college working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward & we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets & you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parent's mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2: 30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying & you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now

51,Paramore,The Only Exception,2010,"When I was younger,
I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that
She would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised

I'd never sing of love if it does not exist
But darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception
Maybe I know, somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
Or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself

that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
But you are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here

I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof, it's not a dream, oh
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes
and I see Mindfreak like
'What's up man, what's happenin'? '
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, no Ghost or Poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I've never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on Cloud 9

(Rivers Cuomo)
I got the magic in me
(I got the magic, baby)
Everytime I touch that track it turns into gold
(Yes it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me
(I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the flo' the girls come snappin' at me
(They be snappin' baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic

Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me!

(Two)
Well take a journey into my mind
You'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd

See, see, when I rhyme I flow on the beat like
pidda-dow-dow
See I deceive you with my intergalactic ether
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm
Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave you with
amnesia

I break all the rules like Evel Knievel
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you saying, it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

(Rivers Cuomo)
I got the magic in me
(I got the magic, baby)

Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems that you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my...

Tremble for yourself, my man,
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble, little lion man,
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face,
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother or else spend your days biting your own neck

And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun

Yeah, we gotta start lookin' at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinkin'
If every second counts on a clock that's tickin'
Gotta live like we're dying

We only got 36 400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying

And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we left out of our lives
And when we long for absolution, there will be no one on the line

Yeah, we gotta start lookin' at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinkin'

You never know a good thing 'til it's gone

How low can you go? (8x)

[Ludacris:]
Luda!
She could go lower than I ever really thought she could,
Face down, ass up!
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans,
Baby pull your pants up,
I like it when I see you do it,
Better then I ever seen it done before,
A lot of women drop it to the ground,
But how low can you go?
Lower then your mama’s ever seen it in her life time,
Never would’ve imagined did not even in her right mind,
Practice in front of that mirror,
Now you doing it on the dance floor,
Mad cause I can’t get wit ya ya just show me how to dance (OH!)
I may not wanna get low so I post it up kinda like a playa do,
But if you come to the crib,
Then I might show you girls a thang or 2,
Yea I think you a superstar wit a ass like that you gotta blow,
Before you make it big,
There's just 1 thing I gotta know

[Repeat Chorus:]

How low can you go? (8x)

I could go low, (Go low) lower than you know,

Go low, (go low) lower than you know,
Go low, (go low) lower than you know,

I be like Nick-nac-paddywac,
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone,
How many licks does it takes till i get to the center and let a realer n-gga take you home,
I could make me show stop,
Soon as you hear this flow pop,
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your drop,
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin low then I'mma shoot a video and put it all on TV,
Cos I like that French vanilla and the caramel,
But when it comes to chocolate,
I know that very well,
Asian persuasion,
No discrimination,
I love how they seen to please us,
I wanna taste them butterican pican peanut buttercups like reeses pieces,
Cause I think you a superstar,
With a ass like that you gotta blow,
Before you make it big,
Well there just 1 thing I gotta know,

[Repeat Hook:]

Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it,
Don’t stop, (Get it, get it)
Put it on reverse just to rack it up,
Let me put some Luda in it,
Show me what you workin wit,
I’ll show you some of this bank roll,
Yea you a superstar but theres 1 thing I gotta know though,

Shine like gold, buzz like a bee

Somehow you come along just like

Mixin’ vodka with caffeine
We’ve got strangers stopping by
And though you’re out of tune
Girl you blow my mind, you do
And I’ll say as I don’t wanna say good night

There’s no quiet corner
To get to know each other
And there’s no hurry
I’m a patient man is your discover

And it goes...

Life's too short to be livin' with stress
I'm too young to be all depressed
I can't complain, I'm highly blessed
And there's one thing that I want to get off my chest
I'm free as a bird, I'm high as a kite
I could do what I want, and I'm doing alright
That's why I just might celebrate tonight
And if you ain't down with it, then get on your bike
To sank elsewhere, who the hell cares
I'm in great shape, you need health care
If you can't say something nice, then keep quiet
Or come to the club, there's girls there
I'm goin' to rave 'til six in the mornin'
I can already hear the baseline callin'
Just make up your mind, stop stallin'
And don't be half assed, 'cause I'm all in
So if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it
Your car don't work, we can go without it
We don't need wheels, just the will to party
I'll take you there, don't doubt it

(Dance, I'll take you there)
Disco, disco, disco, disco
(Dance, I'll take you there)
(Dance, I'll take you there)
Disco, disco, disco, disco
(Dance, I'll take you there)
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

You wanna drink? It's on me
Coca-cola, JD
I don't care about VIP
'Cause the middle of the dance floor's cool with me
I wanna shock tonight
I wanna rock tonight
Come love, let me be the robot tonight
So many damn girls lookin' hot tonight
So before I leave here, I wanna cop tonight
So I can't just stand up against the wall
Try'na play it cool, feelin' like a fool
Like I'm scared to dance, 'cause I ain't scared at all
So there's no point lookin' all miserable
So I've got a big grin on my face
And my hands on a pretty girl's waist
Beer budget and champagne taste
But I feel like I'm running this place
So if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it
Your car don't work, we can go without it
We don't need wheels, just the will to party
I'll take you there, don't doubt it

(Dance, I'll take you there)
Disco, disco, disco, disco
(Dance, I'll take you there)
(Dance, I'll take you there)
Disco, disco, disco, disco
(Dance, I'll take you there)
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

I'm feelin' myself right now
Really revealin' myself right now
I'm actin' a fool, and I think it's all good
I wouldn't be nowhere else if I could
I don't ever wanna go home, let's stay
Party all night and party all day
What do you say? Tell me you're on it
Drink 'til we can't stand up, then vomit
Quicker than a comet, I feel like a star
Everyone waves, they know who we are
So much love, so much dread
Tell me you don't feel like a tomboy
In fact don't tell me nothing, just skank
'Cause I got a shawty and shizz in the bank
No need to thank, the pleasure is mine
We should try do this again some time
And if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it
Your car don't work, we can go without it
We don't need wheels, just the will to party
I'll take you there, don't doubt it

She watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show end, she all on my skin
Lotion, slow motion, roller coasting like back forth, hold it
She pose like it's for posters and I poke like I'm supposed to
Take this photo if you for me, she said, ""Don't you ever show this""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless, when I spoke this, she rejoiced it
Said your words get me open, so I closed it
Where your clothes is, I'm only loving for the moment
Uh, she ain't got a man but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, I mean flawless, well, that's what you are

And now we separated in two

See, we was like the dynamic duo

Yeah you did

Put us together
And you have to hit the rewind

Didn't know I was from the Virgin Islands to the U.K.

My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused

I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path but got on different shoes
Live in the same building but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use

Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down the road
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find the pole
Plus I be sipping so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl that tell a friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it

If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker

And I don't bust back because I shoot first

And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussy, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains

Women are possessive and they wanna possess Wayne

Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my Advance in Advance, Amen

As the world spinning, dancing in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy

I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yea, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Some days you know I wanna just give up

When it doesn't matter who's right
Fight about it all night
Had enough, you give me that look
I'm sorry baby let's make up

You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it, do it one time?

There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue
You and me baby, we're stuck like glue

Just a spoon full of sugar make it better real quick

I say, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whatcha gonna do with that?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, come on over here with that
Sugar sticky sweet stuff, come and give me that stuff
Everybody want some

Melodies that get stuck up in your head

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, up in your head

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Stuck like glue
You and me together, say it's all I wanna do

Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it, do it one time?

There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in

92,Rihanna,Te Amo,2010,"Te amo, te amo
She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

Then she said te amo, then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over

Then she said te amo, then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Listen, we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night, I'm moving through the light because I understand
That we all need love
And I'm not afraid
To feel the love, but I don't feel that way

Then she said te amo, then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away

93,Plain White T's,Rhythm Of Love,2010,"My head is stuck in the clouds, she begs me to come down
Says, ""Boy, quit foolin' around""
I told her, ""I love the view from up here, warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above as it turns to the rhythm of love""

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine, all mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

Well, my heart beats like a drum, guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes, deep like the sea that roll back when she's laughin' at me
She rises up like the tide the moment her lips meet mine

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine, all mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

And long after I've gone, you'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind, the way to make love so fine

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine, all mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

Play the music low
And sway to the music of love
Yeah, sway to the music of love"

96,Taylor Swift,Back To December,2010,"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while

You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping

Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind

You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I'd go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming

If we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I'd go back to December all the time
All the time"

98,Drake,Over,2010,"I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over

'Til it's over
But it's far from over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it

Never drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?

You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas

All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either

Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds

One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'

I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up
Ebert and Roper
I really can't see the end getting any closer

But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on

If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?

And nobody's ever done it like I did it

This is not the end
This is not the beginning

Rocking every revision

But you listen to the tone
And the violet rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within 'em

We say, yeah
With fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there

Until we dead it, forget it

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I wanna do is trade
This life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I wanna do is trade
This life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Yeah, yeah
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on

And I don't even know what kind of things I've said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So picking up the pieces, now where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

All I wanna do is trade
This life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got
