1,Whitney Houston,I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me),1987,"Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away

I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
I've been in love and lost my senses

Spinning through the town

Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last

So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody

Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody

Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Somebody oo Somebody oo
Somebody who loves me yeah

Somebody oo Somebody oo
To hold me in his arms oh

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Don'tcha wanna dance with me baby
Dontcha wanna dance with me boy
Hey Don'tcha wanna dance with me baby
With somebody who loves me
Don'tcha wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don'tcha wanna dance
Don'tcha wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don'tcha wanna dance
Don'tcha wanna dance, say you wanna dance
With somebody who loves me
Dance"
2,Rick Astley,Never Gonna Give You Up,1987,"We're no strangers to love

You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling

Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up

You're too shy to say it

We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you

Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up

4,George Michael,Faith,1987,"Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you

But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh but I
Need some time off
From that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor

Oh, and that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door

Because I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith

Baby
I know you're asking me to stay
Sayin' please, please, please, don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues

Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to lover boy rules

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back
On the floor

Oh, baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Yes I've gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith

Because I got to have faith
Oh yeah, faith
Got to have faith

Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back
On the floor

Oh, baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Because I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith"
5,U2,With Or Without You,1987,"See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

With or without you

With or without you

Through the storm, we reach the shore

You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live with or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give

And you give yourself away

My hands are tied, my body bruised
She's got me with nothing to win

And nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you"
6,Bill Medley & Jennifer Warnes,(I've Had) the Time of My Life,1987,"Now I've had the time of my life
No I never felt like this before
If I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you
'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you

I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone
To stand by me
We saw the writing on the wall
As we felt this magical
Fantasy

Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it
Secretly
So we take each other's hand
'Cause we seem to understand
The urgency just remember

You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love because

I've had the time of my life
No I never felt this way before
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you

With my body and soul
I want you more than you'll ever know
So we'll just let it go
Don't be afraid to lose control, no
Yes I know what's on your mind
When you say ""Stay with me
Tonight."" Just remember

You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love because

'Cause I had the time of my life
And I've searched through every open door
Till I've found the truth
And I owe it all to you"
7,U2,I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,1987,"I have climbed highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run
I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
Burning like a fire
This burning desire

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I believe in the kingdom come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes I'm still running

You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross
Of my shame
Oh my shame
You know I believe it
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for"
8,Jefferson Starship,Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now,1987,"Looking in your eyes I see a paradise
This world that I've found is too good to be true
Standing here beside you, want so much to give you
This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you

Let 'em say we're crazy, I don't care about that
Put your hand in my hand baby don't ever look back
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart

And we can build this thing together
Stand this storm forever
Nothings gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothings gonna stop us,
Nothings gonna stop us now

I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes I will stay here with you
Take it to the good times, see it through the bad times
Whatever it takes here's what I'm gonna do

Let 'em say we're crazy, what do they know
Put your arms around me baby don't ever let go
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart

And we can build this thing together
Stand this storm forever
Nothings gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothings gonna stop us,
Nothings gonna stop us now

Oh, all that I need is you
All that I ever need
And all that I want to do
Is hold you forever, and ever and ever

(break)

And we can build this thing together
Stand this storm forever
Nothings gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothings gonna stop us,
Nothings gonna stop us now"
9,Bon Jovi,Livin' On a Prayer,1987,"Once upon a time not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike

He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man

She brings home her pay for love
For love

She says: We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love -
We'll give it a shot

Wooah
We're half way there
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it
I swear, livin' on a prayer

Tommy got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers: Baby
It's okay, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got
Wooah
We're half way there
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer
We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
Wooah
We're half way there
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer
Wooah
We're half way there
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer
Wooah
We're half way there
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer"
10,Madonna,Who's That Girl?,1987,"Who's that girl?
who's that girl?

When you see her, say a prayer and kiss your heart goodbye
She's trouble, in a word get closer to the fire
Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
You're spinning round and round
You can't get up, you try but you can't

Quién es esa niña?
who's that girl?
Señorita, más fina
who's that girl?
Quién es esa niña?
who's that girl?
Señorita, más fina
who's that girl?

You try to avoid her, fate is in your hands
She's smiling, an invitation to the dance
Her heart is on the street, tu corazón es suyo
Now you're falling at her feet
You try to get away but you can't

Quién es esa niña?
who's that girl?
Señorita, más fina
who's that girl?
Quién es esa niña?
who's that girl?
Señorita, más fina
who's that girl?

Light up my life, so blind I can't see
Light up my life, no one can help me now

Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
You're spinning round and round
You can't get up, you try but you can't

11,Madonna,La Isla Bonita,1987,"Como puede ser verdad

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te diso te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where girl loves a boy and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby"

Come on
Lay it on me
All right

I'm giving you
On count of three

I know your game
What you're about

But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad come on
You know I'm bad, I'm bad come on, you know
You know I'm bad, I'm bad come on, you know

You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands

But they say the sky's the limit

You've been using me
I'm surprised you
Let me stay around you

One day I'm gonna lift the cover

We gotta level before we go
And tear this love apart

There's no fight you can't fight this battle of love with me
You win again, so little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth, no other could see me through
You win again, some never try but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be following you
Following you, oh girl

Oh baby, I shake you from now on
I'm gonna break down your defenses, one by one
I'm gonna hit you from all sides, lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you

You better beware, I swear
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all

There's no fight you can't fight this battle of love with me

And we both know they'll take us
Where we want to go

Hold me now
Touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you

16,Crowded House,Don't Dream It's Over,1987,"There is freedom within
There is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
Many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're travelling with me

Hey now, Hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, Hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car
There's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion But there's no proof
In the paper today
Tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V page

Hey now, Hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again
To the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead
Barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

Hey now, Hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, Hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
You know they won't win

Don't let them win
Hey now, Hey now
Hey now, Hey now
Hey now, Hey now
Don't let them win (They come, They come)
Don't let them win (Hey now, Hey now)"
17,The Pet Shop Boys,It's a Sin,1987,"When I look back upon my life
it's always with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

At school they taught me how to be
so pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything I long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

Father forgive me
I tried not to do it
Turned over a new leaf
then tore right through it
Whatever you taught me
I didn't believe it
Father you fought me
'cause I didn't care
and I still don't understand

So I look back upon my life
forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
no matter when or where or who
has one thing in common too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to I
It's a sin

18,George Michael,I Want Your Sex,1987,"There's things that you guess*
And things that you know
There's boys that you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where my ends

I want your sex
I want you
I want your.....sex

It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go
I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO!

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long baby
Out in the cold
I can't take much more girl
I'm losing control

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your.....sex

It's natural
It's chemical (let's do it)
It's logical
Habitual (can we do it?)
It's sensual
But most of all.....
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you

Sex is natural - sex is good
Not everybody does it
Not everybody should
Sex is natural - sex is fun
Sex is best when it's....one on one
one on one

I'm not your father
I'm not your brother
Talk to your sister
I am a lover

C-c-c-c-come on

What's your defintion of dirty baby
What do you consider pornography
Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me

What's your defintion of dirty baby
What do you call pornography
Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby

Underneath the sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me

Slowly but surely
Yours appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly, softly
I'm falling in love with you

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tear
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers

Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler
Erotic images float through my head
I wanna be your midnight rambler

Quickly but quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly, loudly
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers

Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tear, come on
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers

I feel like going on
I feel like going on
Come on, come on
Erotic images float through my head
Your midnight rambler, baby

Take it
For you anywhere
I don't know I don't care
But all those years
I wanna be your midnight rambler, baby"
20,Aretha Franklin,I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me),1987,"Like a warrior that fights and wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights consumed by the shadows
And was crippled emotionally

Somehow I made it through the heartache
I escaped
I found my way out of the darkness, kept my faith
Kept my faith

And the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting for me

With an endless desire, I kept on searching
Sure, in time our eyes would meet
And like the bridge is on fire, the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

I don't regret a single moment
Looking back, when I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh, I just laugh

And the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we share was meant to be"

Now you left me with nothing, can't take it

Such pretty flowers, so tell me

What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?

You always wanted too much
Now I can do what I want to forever
How am I gonna get through?

They talk too fast and walk too slow
Chasing time from hour to hour
I pour the drinks and crush the flowers

We would walk on the side walk
Innocent, remember?

We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun

What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun

No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh I hope that it won't end though
Alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was going to tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

Somewhere Out There
Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me and loving me tonight
Somewhere out there someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another in that dream somewhere out there

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishin' on the same bright star
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there if love can see us through (love can see us through)
Then we'll be together somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true"

How could I hurt you

And you know, I'd never, never hurt you

67,Paul Simon,Graceland,1987,"The Mississippi Delta was shining
Like a national guitar
I am following the river
Down the highway
Through the cradle of the Civil War
I'm going to Graceland, Graceland
In Memphis, Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland

Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But I've reason to believe
We both will be received
In Graceland

She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead

And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow
I'm going to Graceland
Memphis, Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland

Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
And my traveling companions
Are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But I've reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland

There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
Oh so this is what she means

She means we're bouncing into Graceland
And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody feels the wind blow

In Graceland, in Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see Graceland

And I may be obliged to defend
Every love, every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've got a reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland

In Graceland, in Graceland, in Graceland
I'm going to Graceland"

Closed in on all sides, nothing doing
I feel resistance as I open my eyes
Someone's fooling

I've found a way to break through
This cellophane line

In my own mind

Am I living in a box
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box
Am I living in a cardboard box?

Around and around, circulating

What's moving underground, I'm escaping

Lost in emotion

Some guys will promise you a marriage made in heaven
But I'm gonna stick to my guns
Like waiting for that love that I might be getting
My dreams have yet begun, oh baby

Am I a fool 'cause I don't know
Just how you feel?
And is my love for you?
Oh, I can't conceal

About the crush you have on me?
Oh baby, I'm blind 'cause I just don't see it
But I wanna believe what they see

I find myself telling you things
I don't even tell my best friend
I keep showing emotions not knowing
Just where it all stands for us

From time to time I wonder
What I am in your heart
And even though I don't live there yet
I'm afraid, it will be cold and dark

What are those words whispered baby just as you turn away
I saw you last night out on the edge of town
I wanna read your mind and know just what i've got in this new thing i've found
So tell me what i see when i look in your eyes
Is that you baby or just a brilliant disguise

I heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow
Well i've tried so hard baby but i just can't see
What a woman like you is doing with me
So tell me what i see when i look in your eyes
Is that you baby or just a brilliant disguise

Now look at me baby struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart when out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim i walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you i don't trust 'cause i damn sure don't trust
Myself

Now you play the loving woman i'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close into the palm of my hand
We stood at the alter the gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours maybe baby the gypsy lied
So when you look at me you better look hard and look twice
Is that me baby or just a brilliant disguise

Tonight our bed is cold
I'm lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man
Who doubts what he's sure of"
73,Genesis,In Too Deep,1987,"All that time I was searching, nowhere to run to, it started me thinking,
Wondering what I could make of my life, and who'd be waiting,
Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,
Crying at the top of my voice, and no one listening,
All this time, I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
Ooh you must believe me,
I can feel your eyes go thru me,
But I don't know why.

Ooh I know you're going, but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving,
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,
All this time, I still remember everything you said, oh
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
I can feel your eyes go thru me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself - oh
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring bout somebody else.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

74,New Order,True Faith,1987,"I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
Our valued destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there's just no way of knowing

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time, and you took my money
Now, I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun

He said that we would thank him later
All day he was solid as a rock
But by eight o'clock
We'd be crumbling

One night, my brother Joe and me
Climbed down the family tree
That grew outside our bedroom window
We ran though we knew it couldn't last
Running from the past
From things that we were born to be

Looking back it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
On the back seat of the car
With Joseph and Emily
We only see so far
And we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back it's so bizarre

Dad rang the officer in charge
A man so large
He barely fit his circumstances
He said, ""Two kids out on the street
Were picked up on the beat
And in the station""

So there's me with Emily and Joe
Daddy driving home
All heading in the same direction
He knew no matter what the breaks
We'd make the same mistakes
Couldn't take his eyes of Joe and me

Looking back it's so bizarre

Like a father like a son
And your gonna have to face the music, oh yeah
Face the music

Hey hey
We keep it running in the family
Hey hey
We keep it coming in the family

Looking back it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
On the backseat of the car
With Joseph and Emily
We only see so far
'Cause we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back it's so bizarre, oh yeah
Running in the family
Running in the family
And we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back it's so bizarre, oh yeah

97,LL Cool J,I Need Love,1987,"When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names
Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn
'Coz I said to myself look what you've done to her
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal

Playing make believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amor, kissing you on the ear
Whispering I love you and I'll always be here
Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
And half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy

I need love
I need love

Romance sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say ooo girl you're so sweet
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do

But where you at you're neither here or there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen
Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean
Fantasy's can run but they can't hide
And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside

I need love
I need love

I wanna kiss you, hold you never scold you just love you
Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice, I need love bad
I've got money but love's something I've never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's ten feet tall

I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream land, I can't lie I never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget

I need love
I need love

See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer
A play boy on the run I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust honor respect admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It's taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch of your hand

And understand I'll be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally find you watch our love unfurl

I need love
I need love

Girl, listen to me
When I be sittin' in my room all alone, staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind
And I've come to realize that I need true love
And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen
I'll be waiting, I love you"
