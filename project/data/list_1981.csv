1,Kim Carnes,Bette Davis Eyes,1981,"Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn the music on you
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
She's got Greta Garbo stand-off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
(It whets her appetite)
She'll lay you on the throne
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come up blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you
When she snows you off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll tease you
She'll unease you
Just to please you
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you
When she snows you
She knows you
She's got Bette Davis eyes..."

4,Diana Ross,Endless Love,1981,"My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right

My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I, I want to share
(I)
All my love with you
No one else will do

And your eyes
(Your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Oh yes, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun

Forever
(For)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love
(Oh love)
I'll be a fool for you I'm sure
You know I don't mind
(Oh you know I don't mind)

'Cause you
You mean the world to me
Oh, I know I found in you
My endless love

Oh, and love
(Oh, love)
I'll be that fool for you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind, oh I don't mind
  (Oh you know I don't mind)

And yes, you'll be the only one
'Cause no one can't deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love, my endless love
  (My love, my love)"
5,Soft Cell,Tainted Love,1981,"Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears, and that's not nearly all
Tainted love (Oh oh)

Tainted love

Now I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away, you don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight

And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you

Take my tears, and that's not nearly all
Tainted love (Oh oh)
Tainted love

Don't touch me, please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go

Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love
Tainted love"
6,John Lennon,Woman,1981,"Woman
I can hardly express
My mixed emotion at my thoughtlessness
After all I'm forever in your debt
And woman I will try to express
My inner feelings and thankfullness
For showing me the meaning of succsess
oooh well, well
oooh well, well
Woman I know you understand
The little child inside the man
Please remember my life is in your hands
And woman hold me close to your heart
However, distant don't keep us apart
After all it is written in the stars
oooh well, well
oooh well, well
Woman please let me explain
I never mean(t) to cause you sorrow or pain
So let me tell you again and again and again
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever
I love you (yeah, yeah)..."
7,Phil Collins,In the Air Tonight,1981,"I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it comin' in the air tonight? Oh Lord, oh Lord

Well if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am

And I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack o' lies

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well I remember, I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up

No you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show
But the pain still grows
Some stranger to you and me

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord,oh Lord, oh
I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord"

10,Sheena Easton,Morning Train (Nine to Five),1981,"I wake up every mornin', I stumble out of bed
Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly

'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant
To go slow dancing, anything I want
Only when he's with me, I catch light
Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me)
When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

(My baby takes the morning train)
He's always on that morning train
(He works from nine to five and then)
He works so hard
(He takes another home again)
To find me waiting for him

(My baby takes the morning train)
(He works from nine to five and then)
(He takes another home again)
(To find me waitin' for him)"
11,Christopher Cross,Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do),1981,"Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's master's choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
He's showing himself a really good time
He's laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do is fall in love"
12,Dolly Parton,9 to 5,1981,"Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawnin', stretchin', try to come to life

Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me

They let your dream, just watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away

In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship 'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll you away

Workin' 9 to 5 what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game, no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his wallet

Workin' 9 to 5, oh what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use you mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game, no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his wallet"
13,Blondie,Rapture,1981,"Toe to toe, dancing very close
Body breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night, in Rapture

Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sightless solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty four hour shopping in Rapture

Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly
D.J. spinning, I said, ""My my""
Flash is fast, flash is cool
Francois, c'est pas flashe non due

And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light

And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes the man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head

And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eating cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru

And you don't stop, you keep on eating cars
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars, where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek

One to one, man to man, dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars, is through with cars
He's eating bars,yeah, wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall, he's gonna eat 'em all, Rapture, be pure

Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain
Paint a train, you'll be singing in the rain
Said don't stop to the punk rock

Back to back, body muscular
Spinless movement, bite the jugular
One to one, tea time technology
And a  digital ardour, no sign of saviour in Rapture

Well now you see what you wanna be, just have your party on T.V
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the T.V's on
And now he's gone, back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race

And you hip hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eating cars
And eating bars, and now he only eats guitars, get up"
14,Sheena Easton,For Your Eyes Only,1981,"For your eyes only can see me through the night
For your eyes only, I never need to hide
You can see so much in me, so much in me that's new
I never felt till I looked at you

For your eyes only, only for you
You'll see what no-one else can see and now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The love I know you need in me, the fantasy you've freed in me
Only for you, only for you

For your eyes only, the nights are never cold
You really know me, that's all I need to know
Maybe I'm an open book because I know you're mine
But you won't need to read between the lines

For your eyes only, only for you
You see what no-one else can see and now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The passions that collide in me, the wild abandoned side of me
Only for you, for your eyes only"
15,REO Speedwagon,Keep On Loving You,1981,"You should have seen by the
Look in my eyes baby
There was something missin'
You should have know by the
Tone of my voice maybe
But you didn't listen
You played dead
But you never bled

Instead you laid still in the grass
All coiled up and hissin'
You know I know
All about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us baby
Way before them
And we're still together

And I meant every word I said
When I said that I loved you
I meant that I love you forever
And i'm gonna keep on lovin' you

Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you
And I meant every word I said

When I said that I love you
I meant that I love you forever
And i'm gonna keep on lovin' you

16,The Rolling Stones,Start Me Up,1981,"If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop
If you start me up
And start me up I'll never stop
I've been runnin' hot
You got me tickin' gonna blow my top
If you start me up
I'll never stop

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk smooth, ride in a mean
Mean machine
Start it up

If you start me up
Kick on the starter give it all you got
I can't compete
With the riders in the other heats
If you tough it up
If you like it you can slide it up
If you start me up
I'll never stop

Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
I walk smooth, ride in a mean
Mean machine
Start it up

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen

Start me up I'll never stop
Start me up I'll never stop
Start me up I'll never stop
Never stop, never, never, never stop
Start me up

You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man cum
You, you make a grown man cry
Start me up"
17,Foreigner,Waiting For a Girl Like You,1981,"So long
I've been looking too hard, I've waiting too long
Sometimes I don't know what I will find
I only know it's a matter of time
When you love someone
When you love someone

It feels so right, so warm and true
I need to know if you feel it too

Maybe I'm wrong
Won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong
This heart of mine has been hurt before
This time I want be be sure

I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life

A love that will survive
I've been waiting for someone new
To make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life

You're so good
When we make love it's understood
It's more than a touch or a word we say
Only in dreams could it be this way
When you love someone
Yeah, really love someone

Now, I know it's right
From the moment I wake up till deep in the night
There's no where on earth that I'd rather be
Than holding you, tenderly

I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you
A love that will survive

18,The Police,Every Little Thing She Does is Magic,1981,"Well I've tried before to tell her
All the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Well I had to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolve to call her up
A thousand times in day
And ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way

But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
And before my tongue has tricked me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing she does is magic
The everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

The every little thing she does is magic
The everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

And every little thing
Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing, every little
Every little every little

Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
This is the little magic

Every little thing every little thing
Every little thing she do is magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic, magic"

I don't care what they say

I'm gonna beg you to stay

I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

Honey don't go, don't leave this scene
Be out of the picture and off of the screen
Don't let them say ""we told you so""
They tell me you'll love me and then let me go

I've heard the warning voice
From friends and my relations
They tell me all about your heart-break reputation

I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say. no
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay

I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

People can change, they always do
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be, that like love I am blind?
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?

One thing I know for sure
Is really really real
I never felt before the way you make me feel

I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay

I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do

Being with you

I don't care about anything else

I wanna Be with you

Haunting notes, pizzicato strings

There's no need to take a stand
for it was I who chose to start.
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn.
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.

Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Then slowly turn away from me.
Maybe the sun's light will be dim
and it won't matter anyhow.

If morning's echo says we've sinned
well, it was what I wanted now.
And if we're the victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light.
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.

Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
through the tears of the day
of the years, baby.
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, Darling.
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, Darling."

I can't believe it myself.
Suddenly I'm up on top of the world

Believe it or not, I'm walking on air.
I never thought I could feel so free.
Flying away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me.

Looks like the light of a new day
Hit me from out of the blue.
Breaking me out of the spell I was in
Making all of my wishes come true.

Believe it or not, I'm walking on air.
I never thought I could feel so free.
Flying away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me.

This is too good to be true,
Look at me
Falling for you.
Believe it or not,
Believe it or not,
Believe it or not,
Believe it or not.
Believe it or not,
I'm walkin' on air,
I never thought I could feel so free;
Flyin' away on a wing and a pray'r,
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me.

But hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one

What I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover
When you say you're only in it for fun

From her head down to her toenails;
Yet she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends,
In a limousine.

Three's not a crowd to her, she said;
""Room 714, I'll be waiting.""
When I get there she's got incense, wine and candles;
It's such a freaky scene.

And talk is cheap when the story is good
And the tales grow taller on down the line
But I'm telling you, babe, that I don't think it's true, babe
And even if it is keep this in mind

You take it on the run baby
If that's the way you want it baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it, not for a minute
You're under the gun so you take it on the run

You're thinking up your white lies
You're puttin' on your bedroom eyes
You say you're coming home but you won't say when
But I can feel it coming if you leave tonight keep running
And you need never look back again

You take it on the run baby
If that's the way you want it baby

Will you change your mind will you wander back
Again or have you found yourself a new love

Hearts could cry when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way

To tell the world how I miss you

And your record collection

For next year's old age pension!

The clumsy boots, peekaboo roots

So what's the point of robbery
When nothing is worth taking?

The big mistake he's making

Of deep meaning philosophies
Where only showbiz loses

Throw your safety overboard
And join our insect nation!

I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter, it's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
You're like an angel and you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We Kill The World (don't Kill The World)
I see mushrooms, atomic mushrooms.
I see rockets, missiles in the sky.
Day by day, more and more,
Where will this lead to
And what is this good for?
Poor world, poor world.

Concrete's rising up,
Where yearerday was park
You heard the robin's song
Heavy tractor runs
Where air was clean and cool
Make money, bringing fuel.

Where will this lead to
And what is this good for?
A poor world, poor world.

Fishes doomed to die
As people live close by
And oaktree falls with moon
Parking lots will come
With flowerfields were bright
As junkyard covers sight!

Where will this lead to
And what is this good for?
Poor world, is hurting bad,
Poor world, is doomed to die.

We kill the world
Kill the world
We surely do
In peace we do!
We kill the world
Kill the world
'cause we don't know
What we are doing!

We kill it
One by one
Don't realize!

And nuclear piles stand like monuments
Of destruction throughout over the country

Promenades must go
So cars can drive in row
New fact'ry towers tall
Farmhouse had to fall
No flowers in the air
Pollution everywhere.

Where will this lead to
And what is this good for?
A poor world, poor world.

Oceans in despair
There's rubbish everywhere
The seaweed chokes in mud
Nature's had her lot
With nuclear waste and rot
And mushrooms bloom as clouds.

Where will this lead to
And what is this good for?
Poor world, is hurting bad,
Poor world, is doomed to die.

We kill the world...

Don't kill the world
Don't let her down.
Do not destroy basic ground.
Don't kill the world
Our means of life.
Lend ear to nature's cry.

Don't kill the world
She's all we have,
And surely is worth to save.
Don't let her die,
Fight for her trees,
Pollution robs air to breathe.

Don't kill the world
Help her survive
And she'll reward you with life
And don't just talk,
Go on and do the one, who wins is you.

Cherish the world,
A present from god
On behalf of all creatures,
Made by the lord
Care for the earth,
Foundation of life
Slow progress down help her survive"

89,Barbra Streisand,Comin' in & Out of Your Life,1981,"I still can remember
The last time I cried
I was holding you and loving you
Knowing it would end

I never felt so good
Yet felt so bad
You're the one I love
And what makes it sad
Is you don't belong to me

And I can remember
The last time I lied
I was holding you and telling you
We could still be friends

Tried to let you go
But I can't, you know
And even though I'm not with you
I need you so
But you don't belong to me


Chorus:
Comin' in and out of your life
Isn't easy,
When there are so many nights
I can't hold you and I've told you
These feelings are so hard to find
Comin' in and out of your life
Will never free me
'cause I don't need to touch you
To feel you, it's so real with you

I just can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember the last time we tried
Each needing more than we could give
And knowing all the time
A stronger love
Just can't be found
Even though at times this crazy world
Is turning up-side-down
You'll always belong to me

Chorus"
90,Billy Squier,The Stroke,1981,"Now everybody have you heard
If you're in the game, then the stroke's the word
Don't take no rhythm, don't take no style
Got a thirst for killin', grab your vile

You put your right hand out, give a firm hand-shake
Talk to me about that one big break
Spread your ear-pollution both far and wide
Keep your contributions by your side, stroke has struck me

Could be a winner, boy, you move quite well
Stroke has struck me, stroke has struck me
You got your number down, stroke has struck me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

You put your left foot out keep it all in place
Work your way right into my case
First you try to bed me you make my backbone slide
But when you found you bled me, skip on by, keep on
Stroke has struck me

Give me the business all night long
Stroke has struck me, stroke has struck me
You're so together boy, stroke has struck me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

Better listen now, it ain't no joke
(Said)
Let your conscience fail ya, just do the stroke
Don'tcha take no chances, keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances, you can't stop you just
Stroke has struck me, stroke has struck me

Better listen now, it ain't no joke

Let your conscience fail ya, just do the stroke
Don'tcha take no chances, keep your eye on top

91,Talking Heads,Once in a Lifetime,1981,"And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself
Well... How did I get here?

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
After the money's gone
Once in a lifetime
Water flowing underground

And you may ask yourself
How do I work this?
And you may ask yourself
Where is that large automobile?
And you may tell yourself
This is not my beautiful house
And you may tell yourself
This is not my beautiful wife

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down

There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Under the water, carry the water at the bottom of the ocean
Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
Into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones
There is water underground

Letting the days go by
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
Water flowing underground
Into the blue again
After the money's gone
Once in a lifetime
Water flowing underground

What is that beautiful house?
And you may ask yourself
Where does that highway go to?
And you may ask yourself
Am I right?...Am I wrong?
And you may say to yourself
My God!...What have I done?!

Letting the days go by

Voice too rough with cigarettes

You better shove me back into line now
You better love me all the time now
You better shove me back into line now

I showed up late one night
With a neon light for a visa
But knowing I'm so eager to fight
Can't make letting me in any easier

I know I've been wearing crazy clothes
And I look pretty crappy sometimes
But my body feels so good
And I still sing a razor line every time

And when it comes to all night living
I know what I'm giving
I've got it all down to a tee and it's free

That once turned all my gray skies blue
But you've disappeared, now my eyes are filled with tears
I'm wishin' you were here with me

Soft with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone I don't know what to do

If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine and once again you'd be mine, all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
