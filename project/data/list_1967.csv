Miscellaneous
A Whiter Shade Of Pale
We skipped the light fandango
And turned cartwheels across the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
The crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
Whe we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
Would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
At the moment my eyes were open
They might just as well have been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale"
2,The Monkees,I'm a Believer,1967,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
I thought love was more or less, a givin' thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
Whats the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried.
Solo
A Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed.
Disappointment haunted all my dreams.
Then i saw her face, not I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
I'm in love, I'm a believer!
I couldn't leave her if I tried.
Yes I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
Then I'm a believer! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye
Then I'm a believer!"

5,The Beatles,Penny Lane,1967,"In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Here beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back in

Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
For a fish and finger pie
In summer meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane"
6,Bee Gees,(The Lights Went Out In) Massachusetts,1967,"Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts
Something is telling me I must go home
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own

Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco
Gotta do the things I wanna do
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you

Talk about the life in Massachusetts
Speak about the people I have seen
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen

I will remember Massachusetts"
7,Scott McKenzie,San Francisco (Wear Some Flowers in Your Hair),1967,"If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet some gentle people there

For those who come to San Francisco
Summertime will be a love-in there
In the streets of San Francisco
Gentle people with flowers in their hair

All across the nation such a strange vibration
People in motion
There's a whole generation with a new explanation
People in motion people in motion

For those who come to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you come to San Francisco
Summertime will be a love-in there

If you come to San Francisco
Summertime will be a love-in there"
8,The Monkees,Daydream Believer,1967,"Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise wipe the sleep out of my eyes
The shavin' razor's cold, and it stings

Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen?

You once thought of me as a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, and our good times start and end without dollar one to spend
But how much baby do we really need?

11,Nancy Sinatra,Somethin' Stupid,1967,"I know I stand in line until you think
You have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two...
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you

I can see it in your eyes that you despise
The same old lines you heard the night before...
And though it's just a line to you for me it's true...
And never seemed so right before
I practice everyday to find some clever lines
To say to make the meaning come true...
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume fills my head...
The stars get red and on the nights so blue...
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you

Puppet On A String

Like a puppet on a string

Love is just like a merry-go-round

Then I'm up in the air
Are you leading me on?
Tomorrow will you be gone?

If you love me madly, I'll gladly, be there

In or out, there is never a doubt
Just who's pulling the strings
I'm all tied up to you

15,Tom Jones,The Green Green Grass of Home,1967,"The old home town looks the same as I step down from the train,
and there to meet me is my Mama and Papa.
Down the road I look and there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries.
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
Yes, they'll all come to meet me, arms reaching, smiling sweetly.
It's good to touch the green, green, grass of home.
The old house is still standing, tho' the paint is cracked and dry,
and there's that old oak tree that I used to play on.

Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary, hair of gold and lips like cherries.
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
Yes, they'll all come to meet me, arms reaching, smiling sweetly.
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.

Then I awake and look around me, at the four grey walls that surround me
and I realize, yes, I was only dreaming.
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre -
arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak.
Again I touch the green, green grass of home.
Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
as they lay me neath the green, green grass of home."
16,Engelbert Humperdinck,The Last Waltz,1967,"I wondered should I go or should I stay
The band had only one more song to play
And then I saw you out the corner of my eyes
A little girl alone and so shy
I had the last waltz with you
Two lonely people together
I fell in love with you
The last waltz should last forever
But the love we had was goin' strong
Through the good and bad we'd get along
And then the flame of love died in your eye
My heart was broke in two when you said goodbye
I had the last waltz with you
Two lonely people together
I fell in love with you
The last waltz should last forever
It's all over now
Nothing left to say
Just my tears and the orchestra playing
La la la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la.
I had the last waltz with you
Two lonely people together
I fell in love with you
The last waltz should last forever

How could she tell he deceived her so well
Pity she'll be the last one to know

Silence is golden,
But my eyes' still see
Silence is golden, golden
But my eyes still see

How many times did she fall for his line?
Should I tell her or should I keep cool?
And if I tried I know she'll say I lied
Mind your business, don't hurt her, you fool

Or in the darkest night
No one knows

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you smile with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost
There's no time to lose, I heard her say
Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind.
Ain't life unkind?
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you smile with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you..."

Hey there, Georgy girl
Swingin' down the street so fancy-free
Nobody you meet could ever see the loneliness there inside you
Hey there, Georgy girl
Why do all the boys just pass you by?
Could it be you just don't try or is it the clothes you wear?

You're always window shopping but never stopping to buy
So shed those dowdy feathers and fly a little bit

Hey there, Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide and, oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see a new Georgy girl

Hey there, Georgy girl
Dreamin'; of the someone you could be
Life is a reality, you can't always run away
Don't be so scared of changing and rearranging yourself
It's time for jumping down from the shelf a little bit

It isn't easy, but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To Sir, with love

And long last looks must end
And as I leave I know
That I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That's a lot to learn, what
can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a star
But I, would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love"
24,Bobbie Gentry,Ode To Billie Joe,1967,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""Y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar

To call Alice
When she was just small

Get up and tell you where to go

Snoopy Vs The Red Baron
After the turn of the century
In the clear blue skies over Germany
Came a roar and a thunder men had never heard
Like the scream and the sound of a big war bird
Up in the sky, a man in a plane
Baron von Richthofen was his name
Eighty men tried, and eighty men died
Now they're buried together on the countryside

 Chorus:
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more
The Bloody Red Baron was rollin' out the score
Eighty men died tryin' to end that spree
Of the Bloody Red Baron of Germany

In the nick of time, a hero arose
A funny-looking dog with a big black nose
He flew into the sky to seek revenge
But the Baron shot him down--""Curses, foiled again!""

 (chorus)

Now, Snoopy had sworn that he'd get that man
So he asked the Great Pumpkin for a new battle plan
He challenged the German to a real dogfight
While the Baron was laughing, he got him in his sight

That Bloody Red Baron was in a fix
He'd tried everything, but he'd run out of tricks
Snoopy fired once, and he fired twice
And that Bloody Red Baron went spinning out of sight

Never My Love
(Don Addrisi/Dick Addrisi)

You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love
Never my love

You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never my love
Never my love

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends on you

You say you fear I'll change my mind
I won't require you
Never my love
Never my love

How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life with me
Never my love

Built a world all around her""

Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years

My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years

I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, ah
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her
Yeah hey, hey, hey
Ah, I was made to love her

lyrics by Keith Reid

Your multilingual business friend
Has packed her bags and fled
Leaving only ash-filled ashtrays
And the lipstick, unmade bed
The mirror, on reflection
Has climbed back upon the wall
For the floor she found descended
And the ceiling was too tall

Your trouser cuffs are dirty
And your shoes are laced up wrong
You'd better take off your Homburg
'Cause your overcoat is too long

Town clock in the market square
Stands waiting for the hour
When its hands they both turn backward
And on meeting will devour
Both themselves and also any fool
Who dares to tell the time
And the sun and moon will shadow
And the signpost cease to sign

Your trouser cuffs are dirty
And your shoes are laced up wrong
You'd better take off your Homburg
'Cause your overcoat is too long"

While suspended from a throne

Reflections of the way life used to be
Reflections of the love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now, no love to shield me
Trapped in a world that's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone with only memories
Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control

'Cause although you're gone, I keep holding on
To the happy times, oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
All the love that I've waisted
All the tears that I've tasted, all in vain

Through the hollow of my tears I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt that you have caused
Everywhere I turn, seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put all my faith and trust
Right before my eyes, my world has turned to dust
After all the nights I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises are all that's left of loving you

'Cause when you got a tender love
You don't take care of then you better beware of the happening

One day you're up, then you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me and it can happen to you
I was sure, I felt secure, until love took a detour
Yeah, I'm riding high on top of the world
It happened, suddenly it just happened

I saw my dreams fall apart when love walked away from my heart
And when you lose that precious love you need to guide you
Something happens inside you, the happening
Now I see life for what it is
It's not all dreams, ooh it's not all bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you once

Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened

Is it real, is it fake, is this game of life a mistake
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine
For certain, suddenly I started hurting
I saw the light too late, when that fickle finger of fate
Yeah came and broke my pretty balloon
I woke up, suddenly I just walked up to the happening

So sure, I felt secure, until love took a detour
'Cause when you got a tender love
You don't take care of, then you better beware of the happening"

Oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now, now you're gone

You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness
That was waiting there

You close the door to your heart
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh, my darling, now you're gone

You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away

You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then took my hope
Look at me now

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left it's trace

After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone

don't understand - he's never been known to miss his round.
It's ten o'clock, the housewives yell
""When Jack turns up, we'll give him hell"".
Husbands moan at breakfast tables, no milk, no eggs, no marmalade labels.
Mothers send their children out, to Jack's house to scream and shout.

It's Sunday morning, bright and clear,
lovely flowers decorate a marble square.
People cry and mourn away, think about the fateful day,
Now they wish they'd given Jack more affection and respect,
The little children, dressed in black, don't know what's happened to old Jack.

I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la"

94,The Animals,When I Was Young,1967,"The rooms were so much colder then
My father was a soldier then
And times were very hard
When I was young
When I was young

Smoked my first cigarette at ten
And for girls, I had a bad aim
Oh, I meant so very much
When I was young
When I was young

When I was young, it was more important
Pain more painful, the laughter much louder, yeah
When I was young
When I was young

Don't you know, I met my first love at thirteen?
She was brown, and I was pretty green
I learned so very much
When I was young

Love, my love, my love
Love, my love
Love, my love
Yeah, yeah

When I was young, it was more important
Pain more painful, laughter much louder, yeah
When I was young
When I was a baby

My faith was so much stronger then
I believed in my fellow men
I was really so much older then
When I was young
When I was young

When I was a baby, baby, baby, love
When I [Incomprehensible], yeah
Just got to [Incomprehensible] with no shoes

95,The Beatles,I am the Walrus,1967,"I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob.

Mister City Policeman sitting pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye

Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you been a naughty girl you let your knickers down
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun

If the sun don't come, you get a tan from standing in the English rain
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob
Expert textpert choking smokers don't you thing the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snied

I'm crying
Semolina pilchard, climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hari Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob g'goo..."
96,Bee Gees,New York Mining Disaster 1941,1967,"In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew

Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones

I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
Or have they given up and all gone home to bed
Thinking those who once existed must be dead

Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones

97,James Brown,Cold Sweat,1967,"Ha
I don't care ha, about your past
I just want ho, our love to last, uh
I don't care darlin', about your faults, huh
I just want to satisfy your pulse

Ohh

98,Royal Guardsmen,Snoopy's Christmas,1967,"The news it came out in the First World War
The bloody Red Baron was flying once more
The Allied Command ignored all of its men
And called on Snoopy to do it again



Was the night before Christmas and forty below
When Snoopy went up in search of his foe
He spied the Red Baron and fiercely they fought
With ice on his wings, Snoopy knew he was caught

Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ring out from the land
Asking peace of all the world
And good will to man



The Baron had Snoopy dead in his sights
He reached for the trigger to pull it up tight
Why he didn't shoot, well, we'll never know
Or was it the bells from the village below

{Refrain}
Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ringing through the land
Bringing peace to all the world
And good will to man

The Baron made Snoopy fly to the Rhine
And forced him to land behind the enemy lines
Snoopy was certain that this was the end
When the Baron cried out ""Merry Christmas, mein friend!""

The Baron then offered a holiday toast
And Snoopy our hero saluted his host
And then with a roar they were both on their way
Each knowing they'd meet on some other day

{Refrain twice}"
99,The Move,Flowers in the Rain,1967,"Woke up one morning half asleep
With all my blankets in a heap
And yellow roses scattered all around
The time was still approaching four
I couldn't stand it anymore
Saw marigolds upon my eiderdown

I'm just sitting watching flowers in the rain
Feel the power of the rain making the garden grow
I'm just sitting watching flowers in the rain
Feel the power of the rain keeping me good

So I lay upon my side
With all the windows open wide
Couldn't pressurize my head from speaking
Hoping not to make a sound
I pushed my bed into the grounds
In time to catch the sight that I was seeking

(repeat)

If this perfect pleasure has to be
Then this is paradise to me
If my pillow's getting wet
I don't see that it matters much to me

I heard the flowers in the breeze
Make conversation with the trees
Relieved to leave reality behind me
With my commitments in a mess
My sleep has gone away depressed
In a world of fantasy you'll find me

(repeat)

Watching flowers in the rain
Flowers in the rain
Power flowers in the rain
Flower power in the rain

100,Petula Clark,Don't Sleep in the Subway,1967,"You wander around
on your own little cloud
when you don't see the why
or the wherefore.

Ooh, you walk out on me
when we both disagree
'cause to reason is not what you care for.

I've heard it all a million times before.
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door.

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
Don't stand in the pouring rain.
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
The night is long.
Forget your foolish pride.
Nothing's wrong,
now you're beside me again.

You try to be smart
then you take it apart
'cause it hurts when your ego is deflated.
um-m-um-um-um-um
You don't realize
that it's all compromise
and the problems are so over-rated.

Good-bye means nothing when it's all for show.
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go?

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
Don't stand in the pouring rain.
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
The night is long.
Forget your foolish pride.
Nothing's wrong,
now you're beside me again.

Oh, oh, oh.
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
Don't stand in the pouring rain.
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.
The night is long.
Forget your foolish pride.
Nothing's wrong,
now you're beside me again.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
(repeat chorus and fade out)"
