1,Coolio,Gangsta's Paradise,1995,"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's not much left
coz I've been blastin and laughin so long, that
even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
but I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of
you better watch how you're talking, and where you're walking
or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but i gotta, loc
As I Grow I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
on my knees in the night, saying prayers in the streetlight

been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise

They got the situation, they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the stripes
so I gotta be down with the hood team
too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
got my 10 in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin' banger
and my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool
death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
I'm living life, do or die, what can I say
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24
the way things are going I don't know

Tell me why are we, so blind to see
That the one's we hurt, are you and me

been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
minute after minute, hour after hour
everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
what's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's kickin'
they say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
if they can't undersstand it, how can they reach me
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Tell me why are we, so blind to see
That the one's we hurt, are you and me
Tell me why are we, so blind to see
That the one's we hurt, are you and me"
2,Take That,Back For Good,1995,"I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup, oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion, got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back, want you back, want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back, want you back, I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined I figured out this story
Wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me?

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back, want you back, see I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back, want you back, I want you back for good

And we'll be together, this time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back, want you back, want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back, want you back, see I want you back for good

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back, want you back, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back, I want you back, see I want you back for good

Oh yeah
I guess now it's time that you came back for good"
3,Mariah Carey,One Sweet Day,1995,"Sorry, I never told you
All I wanted to say
Now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away

Never, had I imagined
To living without your smile
Feelin' and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

Picture a little scene from Heaven

Darling, I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

Picture a little scene from Heaven

Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Yeah Lord, I know when I lay me down to sleep
You'll always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

Sorry, I never told you
All I wanted to say"
4,Bryan Adams,Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?,1995,"To really love a woman
To understand her - you gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - see every dream
And give her wings - when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman
When you love a woman you tell her
that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
Cause she needs somebody to tell her

that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
- really really ever loved a woman?
To really love a woman
Let her hold you -
Til you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her

Til you can feel her in your blood

When you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
Cause she needs somebody to tell her

That you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really -

really really ever loved a woman?
You got to give her some faith - hold her tight
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right
She will be there for you, taking good care of you
You really gotta love your woman...

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman
When you love a woman you tell her

that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
Cause she needs somebody to tell her
that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
- really really ever loved a woman?
Just tell me have you ever really
really, really, ever loved a woman?
Just tell me have you ever really
really, really, ever loved a woman?"
5,TLC,Waterfalls,1995,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.

Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

But I think you're moving too fast.

Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.

Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.

Don't go chasing waterfalls.

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.

Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.
I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain

You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind

Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast."
6,Mariah Carey,Fantasy,1995,"Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I'm not sleeping

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby"
7,Michael Jackson,You Are Not Alone,1995,"Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said good-bye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone

I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone

I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

All alone, why, oh...
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear

But first I need your hand, then forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

You are not alone
Oh... whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
Fly... and girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

You are not alone

I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone
That you are not alone (That you are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away)
I am here to stay (I am here to stay)
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone..."

There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah

Living like a tart

In a suitcase

Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me

You don't know how you got here
You just know you want out
Believing in yourself almost
As much as you doubt

You're a big smash
You wear it like a rash
Star

Oh no, don't be shy
It takes a crowd to cry
Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me

They want you to be Jesus
They'll go down on one knee
But they'll want their money back
If you're alive at thirty-three

And you're turning tricks
With your crucifix
You're a star
Oh child

Of course you're not shy
You don't have to deny love
Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me"

Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents

There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I, I just wanna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for St. Nick

I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click

Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding onto me so tight

What more can I do
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of childrens'
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me
The one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me, quickly
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know

Oh Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you, baby"

Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other,
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind

How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind
You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind"

The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades

Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father and that means something to me
Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later

But love
I believe in love

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone

Without love
I believe in love

Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here
Without love I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you
And I wouldn't believe in me

It's Friday night, and I feel all right
The party is here on the Westside
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, ""Monty, yo we made it!""
It feels so good, in my hood, tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani

South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna be player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lowercase G
But now I'm a big G, the girls see I got the money
A hundred dollar bills y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64

And some just don't know how to change

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives

Now, now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
'Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other?
Why do we push love away?

Heaven For Everyone
While you are imagining, imagine for instance,
The sights that you can take advantage of
Look at the beautiful cloud formations below you and above you
This could be heaven
Think of the colour of the sun as it shines off the clouds
In these days, in these days, in these days of cool reflection
You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free, this world could be one,
In this world of cool deception
Just smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind
Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be one
We should bring love to our daughters and sons
Love, love, love, love
(This could be heaven for everyone)
So take a seat and sit by my side a while
You know I like your style
(This could be heaven for everyone)
So what can we do to clean up this mess
Just feel so helpless
This could be heaven for everyone
So lift up your voice at least you'll have cared
At least you'll have dared
Listen. What people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone etc.

You give me just a taste so I want more and more
Now my hands are bleeding and my needs are raw
Now you've got me crawlin', crawlin' on the floor
And I've never met a girl like you before

You've made me acknowledge the devil in me
I hope to God I'm talkin' metaphorically
Hope that I'm talkin' allegorically
Know that I'm talkin' about the way I feel

And I've never met a girl like you before
Never, never, never, never, never met a girl like you before

50,2Pac,Dear Mama,1995,"You are appreciated.

When I was young me and my mama had beef
17 years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breakin' all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary
One day, runnin' from the police that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama
You always was a black queen mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed, a poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it, there's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand.

You are appreciated.

Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin' home after work, late
Your in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate
Just workin' with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, your alone
Tryin' to raise 2 bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand.

You are appreciated.

Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (And dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I got to thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand.

You are appreciated.

Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama)

But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success, we've had good times
But remember this

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there

With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

Just then I realized what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

I understand the meaning of 'I can't explain this feeling' now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made
The fact of reality

The more it shows you really care, right? Yeah

That happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score

Found a note standin' by the phone
Saying ""baby, maybe I'll be back someday""
I wanted to look for you
You walked in; I didn't know just what I should do
So I sat back down and had a beer
And felt sorry for myself, sayin'

Cried so much, I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
She went in the back to get high
I sat down on my couch and cried, yellin'
""Oh mama, please help me!
Won't you hold my hand and...?""

Warm against life's bitter cold... these are the days
The sweetest days we'll know

There are times that scare me, that rattle the house like wind
Both of us so unbending, we battle the fear within
All the while, life is rushing by us hold it now and don't let go
These are the days, the sweetest days we'll know

So we whisper a dream here in the darkness
Watching the stars til they're gone
And when even the memories have all faded away
These days go on and on

Now my eyes are filled with tear
And I'm wishing you were here with me

Soaked with love

Now that you're gone
I just don't know what to do

If only you were here
You wash away my tears
The sun would shine
And once again you'll be me mine, oh, mine

You and I will never be

To make you leave me but what I do know
Is that since you've been gone

As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist

On the last day, I took her where the wild roses grow
She lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
And I kissed her goodbye, said, ""All beauty must die""

The Memory Of Trees
Anywhere Is
I walk the maze of moments
but everywhere I turn to
begins a new beginning
but never finds a finish
I walk to the horizon
and there I find another
it all seems so surprising
and then I find that I know 

Chorus:
You go there you're gone forever
I go there I'll lose my way
if we stay here we're not together
Anywhere is 

The moon upon the ocean
is swept around in motion
but without ever knowing
the reason for its flowing
in motion on the ocean
the moon still keeps on moving
the waves still keep on waving
and I still keep on going 

Chorus 
I wonder if the stars sign
the life that is to be mine
and would they let their light shine
enough for me to follow
I look up to the heavens
but night has clouded over
no spark of constellation
no Vela no Orion 


The shells upon the warm sands
have taken from their own lands
the echo of their story
but all I hear are low sounds
as pillow words are weaving
and willow waves are leaving
but should I be believing

Chorus 
To leave the thread of all time
and let it make a dark line
in hopes that I can still find
the way back to the moment
I took the turn and turned to
begin a new beginning
still looking for the answer
I cannot find the finish
It's either this or that way
it's one way or the other
it should be one direction
it could be on reflection
the turn I have just taken
the turn that I was making
I might be just beginning
I might be near the end."
76,Tina Arena,Chains,1995,"Your arms are warm but they make me feel
As if they're made of cold, cold steel
A simple kiss like a turnin' key
A little click and the lock's on me
Can't move my arms, can't lift my hands
I won't admit to where I am
But I know baby, I'm in chains
I'm in chains

I pretend I can always leave
Free to go whenever I please
But then the sound of my desperate calls
Echo off these dungeon walls
I've crossed the line from mad to sane
A thousand times and back again
I love you baby, I'm in chains
I'm in chains
I'm in chains
I'm in chains

Should have known passing through the gate
That once inside I could not escape
I never thought this could happen to me
Never thought this is where I'd be

I can tell a million lies, I would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger
It hits you right between the eyes

There's a time and a place and a reason
And I know I got a love to believe in
All I know, got to win this time

I... Oh... No, No, No, No, No

Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to the promised land
Hold my hand
Maybe we can't change the world but
I wanna love you the best that, best that I can
Oh, The best that I can"
91,Blues Traveler,Run Around,1995,"Once upon a midnight, dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies, yeah humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up?
When all it does is slow me down

And shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing ""Hey babe, let's keep in touch"", hey baby, let's keep in touch

But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up?
When all it does is slow me down

Tra la la la la bombardier, this is the pilot speaking
And I've got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full, yeah I will drink in and always be full

Oh I like coffee and I like tea
I'd like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well all right okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Oh you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?"

96,Pulp,Common People,1995,"She came from Greece she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's college
That's where I caught her eye
She told me that her dad was loaded
I said, ""In that case I'll have a rum, Coca Cola""
She said, ""Fine""
And then in thirty seconds time she said

I wanna live like common people
I wanna do whatever common people do
Wanna sleep with common people
I wanna sleep with common people like you
Oh, what else could I do
I said, ""I'll, I'll see what I can do""

I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why
But I had to start it somewhere
So it started there

I said, ""Pretend you've got no money""
And she just laughed and said, ""Oh you're so funny""
I said, ""Yeah?
I can't see anyone else smiling in here""

Are you sure you want to live like common people
You wanna see whatever common people see
Wanna sleep with common people
You wanna sleep with common people like me
But she didn't understand
And she just smiled and held my hand

Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school

But still you'll never get it right
'Cos when you're laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you call your dad he could stop it all, yeah

You'll never live like common people
You'll never do whatever common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
And the dance and drink and screw
Because there's nothing else to do

Sing along with the common people
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along even though they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do
Because you think that boy is cool

Like a dog lying in a corner
They will bite you and never warn you
Look out they'll tear your insides out
'Cos everybody hates a tourist
Especially one who thinks it's all such a laugh
Yeah and the chip stains grease
Will come out in the bath

You will never understand
How it feels to live your life
With no meaning or control
And I'm with nowhere left to go
You are amazed that they exist
And they burn so bright
While you can only wonder
Why rent a flat above a shop

Cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'Cos when you're laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all, yeah

Never live like common people
Never do what common people do
Never fail like common people
Never watch your life slide out of view
And dance and drink and screw
Because there's nothing else to do

Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you

97,Gin Blossoms,Til I Hear It From You,1995,"I didn't ask
They shouldn't have told me
At first I'd laugh, but now
It's sinking in fast
Whatever they've sold me

Well baby I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you

It gets hard
The memory's faded
Who gets what they say
It's likely they're just jealous and jaded

Well maybe I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you
Until I hear it from you

I can't let it get me off
Or break up my train of thought
As far as I know, nothing's wrong
Until I hear it from you

Still thinking about not living without it
Outside looking in
Til we're talking about it, not stepping around it
Maybe
I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you (hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you (hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you (hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you
Until I hear it from you
Until I hear it from you (won't take advice from fools)
Ooh (I'll figure everything is cool)
Until I hear it from you (won't take advice from fools)

99,Live,Lightning Crashes,1995,"Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
Her placenta falls to the floor
The angel opens her eyes
The confusion sets in
Before the doctor can even close the door

Lightning crashes, an old mother dies
Her intentions fall to the floor
The angel closes her eyes
The confusion that was hers
Belongs now, to the baby down the hall

Oh now feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it

Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
This moment she's been waiting for
The angel opens her eyes
Pale blue colored iris
Presents the circle
Puts the glory out to hide, hide

Oh now feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it
I can feel it

100,Green Day,When I Come Around,1995,"Oh I heard you cryin' loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone
And it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

Well don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment
Sleazing my backyard so don't get so uptight
You've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and the user
So I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right

So it go, do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that yourself doubt
Means nothing was ever there
You can't come forcing somethin' if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, when I come around
Oh, when I come around
When I come around"
