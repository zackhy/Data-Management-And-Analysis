Hey, teacher, leave 'em kids alone

Miscellaneous
A Woman In Love
Life is a moment in space 
When the dream is gone 
It’s a lonelier place 
I kiss the morning goodbye 
But down inside you know 
We never know why 
The road is narrow and long 
When eyes meet eyes 
And the feeling is strong 
I turn away from the wall 
I stumble and fall 
But I give you it all... 

Chorus: 
I am a woman in love 
And I do anything 
To get you into my world 
And hold you within 
It’s a right I defend 
Over and over again 
What do I do? 
With you eternally mine 
In love there is 
No measure of time 
We planned it all at the start 
That you and I 
Would live in each other's hearts 
We may be oceans away 
You feel my love 
I hear what you say 
No truth is ever a lie 
I stumble and fall 
But I give you it all 

Repeat Chorus 
I am a woman in love 
And I'm talking to you 
Do you know how it feels? 
What a woman can do 
It’s a right 
That I defend over and over again......"
3,John Lennon,(Just Like) Starting Over,1980,"Our life together is so precious together
We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well darling

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere...
Starting over"

The brim pulled way down low
And ain't no sound but the sound of his feet

Without you, when you're gone?

How long can you stand the heat?

8,Queen,Crazy Little Thing Called Love,1980,"This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
This thing (this thing)

Called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby)
In a cradle all night

It swings (woo woo)

It jives (woo woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n roll

She drives me crazy

She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip

Get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

Get on my tracks

11,Abba,The Winner Takes it All,1980,"I don't wanna talk about the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The winner takes it all, the loser standing small
Beside the victory that's her destiny

I was in your arms thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense building me a fence
Building me a home thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The Gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here loses someone dear
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain

But tell me does she kiss like I used to kiss you
Does it feel the same, when she calls your name
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you
But what can I say rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide, the likes of me abide
Spectators of the show always staying low
The game is on again, a lover or a friend
A big thing or a small the winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad
And I understand you've come to shake my hand
I apologize if it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

But you see the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
So the winner takes it all and the loser has to fall
Throw a dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall
Yes it's plain, no complain"

Autoamerican
The Tide Is High
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that oh no
It's not the things you do, that tease and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things, you do to me
Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear 'till it's my turn"
13,Sugarhill Gang,Rapper's Delight,1980,"I said-a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock
It to the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow

But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the riddle that will make your body rock

Well, so far youve heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank: come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out: I'm the C-a-s-an-the-o-v-a, and the rest is f-l-y
Y'see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons, I'll tell ya why:
Y'see I'm six-foot-one and I'm tons of fun, and I dress to a T
Y'see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars that definitely ain't the wack
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac

So after school, I take a dip in the pool which really is on the wall
I got a color TV, so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talkin' 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the rucker, not a dime till I made it again

Y'go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? [(Say what?)]
Y'say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spankin', drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend

Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so what you gonna do?

Well, it's on n on n on on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said m-a-s, t-e-r, a g with a double e
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee

Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin down in history
As the baddest rapper there could ever be

Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat

And then, damn, ya start doin' the Freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sure shot MCs for the affair

Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize

Singin' on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on n n on n on on n on
Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, ya don't dare stop
Come alive, y'all, gimme what ya got

I guess by now, you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind

Singin' on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on n n on n on on n on
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor

I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna feak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind

I said 1-2-3-4, come on girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike, what are you waitin' for?

I said-a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock
It to the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Skiddlee beebop-a we rock a scoobie doo
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast

Rock it up, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie, da bang bang da boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody and dance to the beat

I said-a hip hop, the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop-a you dont stop
Rock it out, baby bubbah, to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie da beat

I said I can't wait till the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak

And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called The Freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak

I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on, Hank, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong

Well, I'm imp the dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies

And when you come inside into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint

A-from sun-to-sun and from day-to-day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic till you can't resist
Everybody, I say, it goes like this:

Well, I was comin' home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables

This young reporter, I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you!
The Cassanova legend must have been true!""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by the name of Lois Lane

And you could be my boyfiend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose

He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit""
I said, ""You need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest

He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party till the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""

I gon' do it, I gon' do it
I gon' do it, do it, do it
And I'm here, and I'm there
I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere

Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop y'all
A-tick a-tock, y'all, you don't stop!

Go hotel, motel, what you gonna do today? [(Say what?)]
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You say, if your girl starts actin' up then you take her friend

I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before

And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons

She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, ""It's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece""

And now, people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya somethin', we're a helluva crew

Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
For you to party, ya got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove

For you to dance, you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rockin affair

But let me tell ya somethin', there's still one fact:
That to have a party, ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn

And while ya sleepin', ya start to dream
And thinkin' how ya danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time

It was phase two, just a-doin' a do
Rockin' ya down 'cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive, girls, get on your feet

To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
On n on into the break of dawn

Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like

Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet

Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood

Like goin' up and not comin' down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, ya do The Freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat

Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood

So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Momma, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh uh, that's bull!""

So your heart starts pumpin', and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says, ""Man, there's plenty of food!""
So you pile some more on your plate

While the stinky foods steamin' your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese

Oh so, you say, ""That's it, I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks!""

So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate

And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food, baby bubbah
But we're still friends""

With a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip-a hop-a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie the beat

I say, Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?
I said, come on make the, make the people move

I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A big bang, I got clientele

And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad

He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now, there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die

A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Y'never let a MC steal your rhyme!""

So from sixty-six to this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile

I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality

Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a Goddamn word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night

A-tick a-tock y'all, a-beat beat y'all
A-let's rock y'all, ya don't stop
Ya go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? [(Say what?)]
Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spankin'
Drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends

A-like that y'all, to the beat y'all
Beat beat ya'll, ya don't stop
A-Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on The Late Show
A-like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well, like The Bar-Kay's singin' Holy Ghost
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most

It's like my man, Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet

A-like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like The Bar-Kays on the mic
Like gettin' right down for you tonight

Like movin' your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously

I said, the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two, I was doin the' do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee

At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five, I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee, it's all the way live

At the age of six, I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Dontcha know I went off?

I got right on down to the beat, you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak

At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night, I had a party rhyme

Goin' on n n on n on on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A-sayin' on n n on n on on n on...
Like a hot buttered de pop de pop de pop
A-saying on n n on n on on n on
'Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
'Cause I'm a helluva man when i'm on the miC
I am the definite feast delight
Come to the Master Gee, you see

Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you 
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you 
would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

Didn't know that you

24,Kenny Rogers,Coward of the County,1980,"Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong.
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow,
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong.

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison;
I took care of Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son.
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy,
""Son my life is over, but yours has just begun"".

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can.
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand,
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man.""

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky.
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man.
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, (and there was three of them).

Tommy opened up the door, and saw Becky crying.
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand.
He reached above the fireplace, and took down his daddy's picture.
As the tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can.
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand,
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man.

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom;
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor.
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! old yeller's leaving,""
But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door.

Twenty years of crawling were bottled up inside him.
He wasn't holding nothing back -- he let 'em have it all.
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing.
He said, ""This one's for Becky, as he watched the last one fall. (And I heard him say,)

""I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek,
And papa, I should hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man"".

looking out for you
But you're not here
What's another year?

I've been waking such a long time,
reaching out for you
But you're not near
What's another year?

to someone who's lost everything that he owns?
to someone who's getting used to being alone?

I've been praying such a long time
It's the only way to hide the fear
What's another year?

to someone who's lost everything that he owns?
to someone who's getting used to being alone?

I've been crying such a long time
With such a lot of pain in every tear

What's another year?
to someone who is getting used to being alone
What's another year?
For someone who is getting used to being alone
What's another year?
to someone who is getting used to being alone"
29,Christopher Cross,Sailing,1980,"Well it's not far down to paradise, at least's not for me
If the wind is right you can sail away and find tranquility
Oh the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see, believe me
It's not far to never, never land, reason to pretend

And if the wind is right you can find the joy of innocence again
Oh the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see, believe me
Sailing, takes me away
To where I've always heard it

Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
Fantasy, it gets the best of me when I'm sailing

All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony, won't you believe me?
Sailing, takes me away
To where I've always heard it

Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
It's not far back to sanity at least it's not for me

And when the wind is right you can sail away and find serenity
Oh the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see, believe me
Sailing, takes me away
To where I've always heard it
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free"

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh Jeannie, you were always someone's fool

Little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years, you still retain the fears of youth
Oh little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
But you're burning it up so fast, searching for some lasting truth

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others who would treat you cruel

But oh oh Jeannie, I'm still in love with you

You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh Jeannie, I'm so in love with you

You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh Jeannie, I'm so in love with you

You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new

32,Goombay Dance Band,Sun Of Jamaica,1980,"Long time ago, when I was a young boy
I saw that movie ""Mutiny on the Bounty""
Starring my idol, Marlon Brando
And I felt a yearning for that great adventure
So many nights I woke up out of a dream
A dream of blue seas, white sands,
Paradise birds, butterflies and beautiful warm-hearted girls

Sun of Jamaica, the dreams of Malaika
Our love is my sweet memory

Sun of Jamaica, Blue Lady Malaika
Some day I'll return, wait and see
Walk in the sand and I'm happy with you
We shall be loving and true
Oh I sure love Malaika
With all of my heart
I will always be faithful and true, yeah true

But now as I grew older
This buring desire became so strong

That I bought me a ticket to fly over there
And then I found you
And we found an eternal love right from the beginning
Stars falling down from the sleepy lagoon
Palms swaying under the moon
We were swimming out into the calm, crystal sea
In that fateful night I thought to myself
I'll do everything I can, save every dime
And one day I'll return, come back home to you
And then I'll stay forever, forever

Sun of Jamaica, the dreams of Malaika
Our love is my sweet memory

Sun of Jamaica, Blue Lady Malaika
Some day I'll return, wait and see
Walk in the sand and I'm happy with you
We shall be loving and true
Oh I sure love Malaika
With all of my heart
I will always be faithful and true, yeah true"
33,George Benson,Give Me the Night,1980,"Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party
Starts to come alive

Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues
And hit the city lights

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night

You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine
A little late romance

It's a chain reaction
You'll see the people of the world
Coming out to dance

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night

So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise

And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see
That starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly?

Just give me the night
Give me the night

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night

So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise

And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see
That starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly?

And if we stay together
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening
Taking us up high

Never mind the weather
We'll be dancing in the street
Until the morning light

And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night

34,Air Supply,All Out of Love,1980,"I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too but what else can we do?
Tormented and torn apart

I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right, believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too?
Does the feeling seem oh so right?

And what would you say if I called on you now
Saying that I can't hold on?
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right, believing for so long

35,David Bowie,Ashes to Ashes,1980,"Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumor from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message from the action man
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following""

The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again

I'm stuck with a valuable friend
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too""
One flash of light but no smoking pistol

I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

My mother said, ""To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom""
My mother said, ""To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom""

36,Rupert Holmes,Escape (The Pina Colada Song),1980,"I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long
Like a worn-out recording of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed
And in the personals column there was this letter I read

""If you like Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape
I'm the lady you've looked for, write to me and escape""

I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half-bad

""Yes, I like Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's, where we'll plan our escape""

So I waited with high hopes then she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady and she said, ""Oh, it's you""
And we laughed for a moment and I said, ""I never knew""

""That you liked Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape
You're the love that I've looked for, come with me and escape""

""If you like Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain

Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise
Pour me a drink
And I'll tell you some lies
Got nothin' to lose
So you just sing the blues
All the time
Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here

With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile
First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
When they know they have you

Then they really have you

Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave,
Just get away
We all know the song

You need what you need
You can say what you want

Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold
When you love's on the rocks
First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave
Just get away
We all know the song
Love on the rocks
Ain't no big surprise
Pour me a drink
And I'll tell you my lies

And now all I want is a smile"

46,Frank Sinatra,Theme From 'New York New York',1980,"Start spreadin' the news
I'm leavin' today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York.
These vagabond shoes

Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York.
I want to wake up
In a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill

Top of the heap...
These little-town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York.

If I can make it there

I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York.
New York, New York

I want to wake up in a city
That never sleeps

And find I'm A number one
Top of the list
King of the hill, A number one...
These little town blues

Are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it
In old New York
And If I can make it there
I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New Yoooooooooork...
New Yooork!"

49,Donna Summer,On The Radio,1980,"Someone found a letter you wrote me, on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant.

Whoa I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered, too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa oh oh oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh

Now, now
Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I want to hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah
And it made me feel proud when I heard you say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa oh oh
On the radio

If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Well tune right in you made find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud, they said it really loud

Whoa, oh, oh
On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh

Comfort me through all this madness

Come give me your sweetness
Now there's you, there is no weakness
Lying safe within your arms, I'm born again

Reaching through this world
In need of one

51,Joy Division,Love Will Tear Us Apart,1980,"When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads

Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold turned away on your side?
Is my timing that flawed our respect run so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Do you cry out in your sleep all my failings exposed?
And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Is it something so good just can't function no more?

When love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again"
52,Bette Midler,The Rose,1980,"Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger an endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower and you, it's only seed

It's the heart, afraid of breaking that never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking that never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dying that never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love, in the spring becomes the rose"

57,The Pointer Sisters,He's So Shy,1980,"When I first saw him standing there
I longed to speak but did not dare
Something inside whispered to me
You'd better move in carefully
And then he smiled and turned away
That told me all he could not say
That's when I knew he wanted me too
But I had to do some breaking through

()
He's so shy(so good lookin'), he's so shy (really got me goin')
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy (one in a million), he's so shy (really got me spinnin')
And he's much too good to let get by
Oh oh oh yes he is

Now holding him gently through the night
Nothing has ever felt so right
And I'm so glad I took the time
That I had to take to make him mine
He can still do things to my heart
Just like he did right from the start
Each time I see that quality
That never stops attracting me

That I'll love him 'till the day I die

Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive! Eh!

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now! - and be loved?

It couldn't have been
You couldn't have seen him yesterday.

I hate it when he's away.

You must be mistaken, I'm sure that you are.
There's more that one care with stickers on
And lots of young guys wear corduroy shirts,
And I'd know if he hadn't gone.

Take that look off your face.
I can see through your smile.
You would love to be right.
I bet you didn't sleep good last night,
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door.
Well, I've got news for you: I knew before.

If I'm not mistaken, I know when it came,
In fact I can name the very day.
When we started to plan the future and all,
Joe started to pull away.

No, I didn't dig deep.
I did not want to know.
Well, you don't interfere
When you're scared of the things you might hear.
Bet you think I should end this
Right now as you would do.
Well, my hard bitten friend,
I am not you.

Take that look off your face!
I can see through your smile.

Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that may be we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
Oh but seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night

There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours, you were late

Since then I've been runnin' around tryin' to find you
I went to the places that we always go
I rang your house but got no answer
Jumped in my car, I went round there
Still don't believe it, he was just leavin'

73,The Village People,Can't Stop the Music,1980,"Everyone you meet, the children in the street
Are swayin' to the rhythm, there's somethin' movin' in them.
There's no place to hide, so, why even try?
Can't you hear it coming your way, it's here to stay.
Music in our walk, music when we talk.
It's really something magic, to lose it would be tragic.
Can't you feel the sound movin' through the ground?
Music makes the world go around.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the cold from snow, tell the trees, don't grow,
Tell the wind don't blow, 'cause it's easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the spark from love, make the rain fall up
'cause that's easier to do.

Movin' with the wind since the world began,
The beat is gonna getcha, beat is gonna getcha.
Music for the blues, for your dancin' shoes,
There's music in the way that we kiss, you can't resist.
Movin' through the trees, buzzin' with the bees,
The sound is gettin' louder, sound is gettin' louder.
Music when we play, when we kneel to pray.
There's music in the sound of the wind.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the heat from flame, try not feeling pain,
Though you try in vain it's much easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Change the master plan, take the hope from man
'cause that's easier to do.

On the radio, on every TV show
For each and every reason, each and every season.
Music when we love for the moon above,
Music for the show of life that never ends.
Music on a plane, music on a train,
Sailing on the ocean, music in the motion.
Music in your car, at your local bar.
There's music when you look at a star.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Keep two loves apart, mend a broken heart,
Catch a fallin' star that's much easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Tell the sun don't shine, stop Old Father Time
'cause that's easier to do.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the cold from snow, tell the trees, don't grow,
Tell the wind, don't blow, 'cause it's easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the spark from love, make the rain fall up
'cause that's easier to do."

Leave her alone, they say
Separated by fools
Who don't know what love is yet
But I want you to know

If I could fly, I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Like you've never seen, ever seen

It's like having a dream
Where nobody has a heart
It's like having it all
And watching it fall apart

And I would wait till the end of time for you
And do it again, it's true
I can't measure my love
There's nothing to compare it to
But I want you to know

If I could fly, I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night

Caught like a wildfire out of control

Searching for shelter again and again

My body's weak
I'm on the run

I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico

And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife, she's out of my life

It's out of my hands, it's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands, she's out of my hands

So I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I've learned too late and

She's out of my life, she's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife, she's out of my life"

And I heard the sound of a cappella groups, yeah

I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a ""J""

Everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and began to play
And it was late in the evening

I said, ""I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do""
