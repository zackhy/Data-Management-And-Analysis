1,Rihanna & Calvin Harris,We Found Love,2011,"Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

3,Adele,Rolling In The Deep,2011,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

I can't help feeling
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat."
4,Bruno Mars,Grenade,2011,"Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Should have known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open,
Why were they open?

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked 'cause
What you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah)

Oh oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue,
Beat me 'til I'm numb,
Tell the devil I said 'hey' when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are,
Yeah you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah)

Oh oh, I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby,
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire,
Oh you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me you're a liar 'cause you never,
Ever, ever did baby

But darling I'll still catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah)

Oh oh I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same
No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Oh, you'll never do the same
No, no, no, no"

6,Maroon 5,Moves Like Jagger,2011,"Just shoot for the stars if it feels right
Then aim for my heart if you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid, my ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue, and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes, and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Maybe it's hard when you feel like
You're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I make you believe
That I've got the key

Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you want to steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue, and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes, and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

You want to know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
But if I share my secret
You gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this

So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh, baby, roll me right
But if I share my secret
You gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue, and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you

8,Adele,Someone Like You,2011,"I heard that you're settled down, That you found a girl, And you're married now.

I heard that your dreams came true, Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you.

Old friend, why are you so shy, Ain't like you to hold back, Or hide from the light.

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited, but I, couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me- it isn't over.

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too,
Don't forget me I beg I'll remember you said: ""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah.

You know how the time flies. Only yesterday was the time of our lives. We were born and raised, In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days.

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded, that for me, it isn't over.

Never mind I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you too.

Don't forget me I beg I'll remember you said, ""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""

Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes they're memories made. Who would have known how bitter-sweet this would taste.

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me I beg I'll remember you said, ""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.""

Never mind how I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you two. Don't forget me I beg I'll remember you said, ""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.""
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah yeah."""

10,Katy Perry,E.T.,2011,"You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?

Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing

You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and

And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all
All

You ready?

Seems like everybody's got a price,
I wonder how they sleep at night.
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second,
Just stop for a minute and smile.

Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious.
Got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time.

We need to take it back in time,
When music made us all unite.
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only one gettin' tired?

Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness.
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feelin' alright.

Yeah, yeah.
Well, keep the price tag,
And take the cash back.
Just give me six streams and a half stack.
And you can keep the cars,
Leave me the garage.
And all I...
Yes, all I need are keys and guitars.
And guess what, in thirty seconds, I'm leaving to Mars.
It's like this man, you can't put a price on the life.
We do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice every night.
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never,
So we gon' keep everyone moving their feet,
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing.

A message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I'm on my way

Let's go, yeah, you're listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fucking hits than a disciplined child

So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I'm like a young gun fully black Barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with the racket and bat

Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk, so down to earth, I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed

Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malory Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at? Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

Oh, written in the stars a million miles away
A message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I'm on my way

Yeah, I needed a change, when we ate we never tip
'Cause we needed the change, I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying
I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray

They say the money is the route to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave 'em amazed, great

It feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man

I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming 'til they hear you out
Oh, written in the stars a million miles away
A message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I'm on my way
Ishi, Eric Turner, let's go
Oh, written in the stars a million miles away

And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong, but my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

When laying with you I could stay there
Close my eyes, feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better
'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you's play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touch your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop

It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me, forgave me
For all of my shortcomings, welcome to my homecoming

Lot of fights, lot of scars
Lot of bottles, lot of cars
Lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog

And here I stand, a better man

Thank you Lord

You don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

And who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
Tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?"
37,Pink,F**kin' Perfect,2011,"Made a wrong turn, once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss, no way it's all good, it didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated, look, I'm still around

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're perfect to me

You're so mean when you talk
About yourself, you are wrong
Change the voices in your head
Make them like you instead

So complicated, look how big you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, see you do the same

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're perfect to me

The whole world stares while I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
So cool in lying and we tried, tried, tried
But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time

Done looking for the critics 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Strange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that? Why do I do that? Why do I do that?

Ooh, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're perfect to me
You're perfect, you're perfect

Pretty, pretty please if you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than perfect
You're perfect to me"

And I think I like him better with the fitted cap on
He ain't even gotta try to put the mac on
He just gotta give me that look, when he give me that look
Then the panties comin' off, off, uh
Excuse me, you're a hell of a guy you know I really got a thing for American guys

50,Bad Meets Evil & ,Lighters,2011,"This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be

With my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this
I would've already spiraled up
I would never do nothing
To let you cowards fuck my world up

If I was you I would duck
Or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin'
Put your lighters up, point them skyward

Had a dream I was king, I woke up still king
Rap game's nipple is mine for the milkin'
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music

There is, or there ever will be, disagree, feel free
But from now on I'm refusin' to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's usin', no more excuses
Excuse me, if my head is too big for this buildin'

And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick
But you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped
Your life around, crock of shit

Who you dicks tryin' to kid?
Flip dick you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause cock
Backwards is still cock, you pricks

I love it when I tell them shove it 'cause it wasn't that
Long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, lustered
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzzin'

Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it?
Wasn't 'cause he has buzzards
Circlin' around his head
Waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?

Or was it 'cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy ass fusses
Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?
What difference it make?

What's it take to get it through your thick skulls
That this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way

From a place that was dark
As I was in just to get to this place
Now these words be like
A switchblade to a hater's ribcage

And let be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks
'Cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bic's raise 'cause I came with 5'9""
But I feel like I'm 6'8""

This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be

With my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see

A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this I probably already be outty
I advance like goin' from totin' iron
To goin' and buyin' four or five of the homies
To Iron Man Audi

My daddy told me, slow down boy, you're gonna blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way
That he did Dr. Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it

I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right, that I write till he can march right
In to that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in twenty years

I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
There's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up, must come down
You goin' down on something
You don't wanna see, like a hairy box

Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, ow, I'm classic now
Always down for the catch weight, like Pacquiao

Y'all are doomed, I remember
When T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes

'Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from havin' my city locked up
To gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick

And now I'm fantastic, compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams
Starin' at a bee hive and how real is that?

I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass
Without the MTV awards gag

You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight we're alright
So hold up your light, let it shine

'Cause this one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be

Lift my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters"

A penny for my thoughts, oh no I'll sell them for a dollar

Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love

When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love

Ooohh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'

64,Mumford & Sons,The Cave,2011,"It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck

And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck

And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck

And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"

I couldn't listen to a joke or rock and roll
And muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart

With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time, I'm not leaving without you

In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time

Still want my lipstick all over your face

Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real,
No, it's never felt so right

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

No, I don't want to say goodnight
I know it's time to leave, but you'll be in my dreams
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, oh, let's do this right
With just a kiss goodnight
With a kiss goodnight, kiss goodnight"

I wear a demeanor made of bright pretty things
What she wears, what she wears, what she wears
Birds singing on my shoulder in harmony it seems
How they sing, how they sing, how they sing

Give me nights of solitude, red wine, just a glass or two
Reclined in a hammock on a balmy evening
I'll pretend that it's no thing that's skipping my heart when I think
Of you thinking of me, babe, I'm crazy over you

Aaah Aaah Aaah
there's something in the water, something in the water
Aaah Aaah Aaah
There's something in the water that makes me love you like

I've got halo's made of summer, ribbons made of spring
What she wears, what she wears, what she wears
I got crowns of words a woven each one a song to sing
Oh I sing, oh I sing, oh I sing

Give me long days in the sun
Preludes to the nights to come
Previews of the mornings laying in all lazy
Give me something fun to do, like a life of loving you
Kiss me quick now baby I'm still crazy over you

84,"Dr Dre, ",I Need A Doctor,2011,"I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

I told the world one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Y'all starting to creep in, everyday it's just so gray and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em
They just say it's whack, they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathing life in me, I owe my life to you
but for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
See this light in you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick, you gon' either wanna fight me
When I get off this fucking mic or you gon' hug me
But I'm not an option, there's nothing else I can do 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy but you're either getting lazy
Or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinion's not one you can form

Can't make a decision, you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are

It was you who believed in me
When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy Dre
I'm crying in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith, and you ain't giving up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
Bring me back to life, bring me back to life, bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jumpsuit, whole room, cracked jokes
But once you got inside the booth, told you like smoke

Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said they was riding to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, fagots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots, and the cracker's ass

Little crackerjack beat, making wack mass
Backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they scream, Dre don't leave us like that man 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life"

There's bullets flying through the air
and they still carry on.
We watch it happened over there
and then just turn it off
We must stand together
There's no giving in
Hand in hand forever
That's when we all win
That's that's that's when we all win
That's that's that's when we all win
They tell us everything's alright
and we just go along
How can we fall asleep at nigth?
when something's clearly wrong
When we could feed at starving world
with what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same
We must stand together

There's no giving in

Hand in hand forever

That's when we all win
That's that's that's when we all win
That's that's that's when we all win
The right thing to guide us
Is right here, inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heartbeat
The drumbeat carries on
The drumbeat carries on
-just like a hearbeat-
We must stand together
There's no giving in
Hand in hand forever
That's when we all win
That's that's that's when we all win
That's that's that's when we all win."

94,caro emerald,A night like this,2011,"From where you are,
you see the smoke start to arise,
where they play cards.
And you walk over softly moving passed the guards.
The stakes are getting higher.
You can feel it in your heart.
He calls you bluff.
He is the ace you never thought he played that much.
And now it's more than all this cards you want to touch.
You never know if winning this could really be enough.

Take a look, beyond the moon you see the stars.
And when you look around, you know the room by heart.

I have never dreamed it.
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it.
I may never see a night like this.
When everything you think is incomplete.
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek.
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this.

How many times,
have I been waiting by the door to hear these chimes?
To hear that some one debonaire has just a arrived.
And opened up to see my world before my eyes.
That silhouette creates an image on the night I can't forget.
It has the scent of something special, I can't rest.
If I resist temptation, oh I know for sure that I will lose the bet.

I walk away and suddenly it seems I'm not alone.
In front of me he stands -- I stop, before he goes.

I have never dreamed it.
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it.
I may never see a night like this.
When everything you think is incomplete.
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek.
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this.

I have never dreamed it.
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it.
I may never see a night like this.
When everything you think is incomplete.
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek.
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this."
95,James Morrison,I Won't Let You Go,2011,"Now you were standing there right in front of me,
I hold on it's getting harder to breathe.
All of a sudden these lights are blinding me.
I never noticed how bright they would be.

I saw in a corner there is a photograph,
no doubt in my mind it's a picture of you.
It lies there alone in its bed of broken glass.
This bed was never made for two.

I'll keep my eyes wide open,
I'll keep my arms wide open.

Don't let me, Don't let me, Don't let me go.
Cause i'm tired of feeling alone.

Don't let me, Don't let me go.
Cause i'm tired of feeling alone.

I promised that one day i'd bring you back a star.
I caught one and it burned a hole in my hand oh
Seems like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying to make you understand,
I'll keep my eyes wide open yeah
I'll keep my eyes wide open yeah

Don't let me, Don't let me, Don't let me go.
Cause i'm tired of feeling alone.

Don't let me, Don't let me go.
Cause i'm tired of feeling alone

Don't let me, Don't let me, Don't let me go.
Cause i'm tired of sleeping alone."

98,Florence + The Machine,Shake It Out,2011,"Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play

And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues strong
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around

All of these questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
So I like to keep my issues strong
But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, ooh whoa

Tonight I'm done with my graceless heart
Tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues strong
It's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, ooh whoa

And given half the chance would I take any of it back
  (Shake it out)
It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
  (Shake it out)
It's always darkest before the dawn
  (Shake it out, ooh whoa, ooh whoa)

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat

'Cause looking for heaven for the devil in me
Looking for heaven for the devil in me
Well, what the hell I'm gonna let it happen to me?

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, ooh whoa

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa

100,Jason Aldean,Dirt Road Anthem,2011,"Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road,
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.
Memory lane up in the headlights,
It's got me reminiscing on them good times.
I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.

Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go.
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road.
Jump the barbwire, spread the word.
Light the bonfire, then call the girls.
The king in the can and the Marlboro man.
Jack'n'Jim were a few good men.
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too.
Better watch out for the boys in blue.

And all this small town he said, she said,
Ain't it funny how rumors spread.
Like I know something ya'll don't know,
Man that talk is gettin' old.
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth,
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out.
Im tired of talkin, man, ya'll ain't listenin',
Them old dirt roads is what ya'll missin'.

I'm chillin' on a dirt road.
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.

Memory lane up in the headlights,
It's got me reminiscing on them good times.
I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.

I sit back and think about them good ole days.
The way we were raised, and our southern ways,
And we like cornbread, and biscuits,
And if it's broke round here we fix it.
I can take ya'll where ya need to go,
Down to my hood, back in them woods.

We do it different 'round here, that's right,
But we sure do it good, and we do it all night.
See, if you really wanna know how it feels,
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels,
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends,
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends.

I'm chillin' on a dirt road.
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.
Memory lane up in the headlights,
It's got me reminiscing on them good times.
I'm turning off of real life, driving that's right,
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.
Thats right.
