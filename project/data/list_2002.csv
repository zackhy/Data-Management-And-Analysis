1,Eminem,Lose Yourself,2002,"Look
If you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!
Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody

He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better

The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water

His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada

So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher

Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go

I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better

Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

You can do anything you set your mind to, man"
2,Eminem,Without Me,2002,"Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside

Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating

When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms.Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, ""This looks like a job for me""
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

Little Hellions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me? Well I'm back
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting

Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, ""This looks like a job for me""
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno

Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene

No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, ""This looks like a job for me""
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy

3,Shakira,"Whenever, Wherever",2002,"Lucky you were born that far away, so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence

Baby, I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

Ledo lo le lo le, ledo lo le lo le
Can't you see?
I'm at your feet

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there, and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear

There over, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains

Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave, will cry a river

Ledo lo le lo le, ledo lo le lo le
At your feet
I'm at your feet

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there, and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear

There over, hereunder
Or up above, don't wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

Ledo lo le lo le, ledo lo le lo le
Think out loud
Say it again

Ledo lo le lo le lo la
Tell me one more time
That you'll live lost in my eyes

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there, and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear

There over, hereunder
You've got me head over heels
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the way I feel

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there, and you'll be near

And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

It's always times like these
When I think of you
And wonder if you ever think of me
Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, oh, oh

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonight"
11,Shakira,Underneath Your Clothes,2002,"You're a song written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
Right under your clothes
Is where I find them

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a...

I love you more than all that's on the planet
Moving, talking, walking, breathing
You know it's true
Oh, baby, it's so funny
You almost don't believe it

As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

Underneath your clothes
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl"

She turns on TV
Guess who she sees

They already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

Haven't you heard
How we rock each others world

18,The Calling,Wherever You Will Go,2002,"So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to youI

f I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind

I'll stay with you for all of time
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go"

21,Usher,U Got it Bad,2002,"Oh, no, no, no, no...

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know

And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that - this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone

If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby...

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about

U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

When you say that you love 'em
And you really know
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars
(You can have it all back)
Flowers, cards, and candy
(I do it just cause I'm...)
Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know
I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song

Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm you gIrl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best i can

See I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that - this is what i found
Everyone of ya'll are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad... hey

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone

22,Robbie Williams,Feel,2002,"Come on hold my hand
I wanna contact the living
Not sure I understand
This role I've been given

I sit and talk to God
And he just laughs at my plans
My head speaks a language
I don't understand

I just wanna feel real love
Feel the home that I live in
'Cause I got too much life
Running through my veins, going to waste

I don't wanna die
But I ain't keen on living either
Before I fall in love
I'm preparing to leave her

I scare myself to death
That's why I keep on running
Before I've arrived
I can see myself coming

I just wanna feel real love
Feel the home that I live in
'Cause I got too much life
Running through my veins, going to waste

And I need to feel
Real love
And a life ever after
I cannot give it up

I just wanna feel real love
Feel the home that I live in
I got too much love
Running through my veins, to go to waste

I just wanna feel real love
In a life ever after, there's a hole in my soul
You can see it in my face
It's a real big place

Come and hold my hand
I want to contact the living
Not sure I understand
This role I've been given

Not sure I understand
Not sure I understand
Not sure I understand
Not sure I understand"

27,No Doubt,Hey Baby,2002,"Doubt - Hey baby Song Lyrics
I'm the kinda girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Takin it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watchin all the sin
Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty ways

I'm just sippin on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

All the boys say
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Girls Say, Girls Say
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Hey Baby Baby
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Boys Say, Boys Say
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
All the boys get the girls in the back

I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you had enough you'll get the pass
And you can tell your friends how you made it back
No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

All the boys say
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Girls Say, Girls Say
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Hey Baby Baby
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
Boys Say, Boys Say
Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey
All the boys get the girls in the back

Check it out, it's Bounty Killer, and No Doubt

Jump on the stage makes me goin crazy
Afterwards myself and one of them gorgeous ladies
There is no need to be actin shady
Comon baby, hey hey baby

Jump on the stage makes me goin crazy
Afterwards myself and one of them gorgeous ladies
There is no need to be actin shady
Comon baby, hey hey baby

When you rock your hips you know that it amaze me
Got me off the hook and nothing else don't phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
If no, no maybe, Hey Baby

I'm just sippin on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

I'm just sippin on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

Way I'm lookin at you whatever
keep lookin at me
Gettin' scared now, right?
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good right?
Listen

I kind of noticed something wasn't right
In your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face'll change...

If you smilin', that should set the tone
Just be limber
And If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Just remember
Sing this song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

People are so phony
Nosy cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hating
When it doesn't matter anyway
Cause we're here tonight

If you smiling, that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
And If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Baby just remember
Sing this song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance
To be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance
To be your man
Here baby, put on my jacket
And then ...

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl
Maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you baby)
Girl ...

Ma, what you wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
From them you heard ""wow, it's the same glow""
Look at me, I say ""yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my air of life
You have me sleeping in the same bed, every night

Go rock with me, you deserve the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down
Pumping N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play this free, joint called ""brain""
(I just love your, Brain)
Ma, take a hint
Make me suerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl
Maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you baby)
Girl ...

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
(Can't love you like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
(Trust ya like I do)
Late at night, I talk to you
(Hey)
You will know the difference when I

Break this down

You know, I used to dream about this when I was a
little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, Drums
(Hey)
It's kind of special right? yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now everybody dance."

Temperature's up, can you feel it?
About to erupt, gonna get my girls

And that's when we take it to the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Uh ohs, here we go, here we go

Yo, hot damn, Doc and Jam like a summer show
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll

Doc the one that excite ya divas
If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina, better hop in here
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair

The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up

Baby it's Brick City, you heard of that
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB, the way I'm freaking

Gonna get rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty

You give me something 
to believe in
Everytime that I got 
you near me
I don't believe that 
I want it to be 
But you know that
I'm gonna take 
my chance now
I'm gonna make
 it happen somehow
And you know I can 
take the pressure
A moment's pain for
a lifetime pleasure

32,Five for Fighting,Superman (It's Not Easy),2002,"I can't stand to fly

I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane
I'm more than some pretty face beside a train
And it's not easy to be me

I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie? Bout a home I'll never see
It may sound absurd but don't be naive

Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed but won't you concede
Even heroes have the right to dream?
And it's not easy to be me
Up up and away away from me

Well it's all right
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything
I can't stand to fly

I'm not that naive
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees
I'm only a man in a silly red sheet

Digging for kryptonite on this one way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Looking for special things inside of me
Inside of me, inside of me, yeah
Inside of me, inside of me

I'm only a man looking for a dream

Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear
So through darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you
Hush now
I see a light in the sky
Oh it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel
With love
Let the rain come down
And wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul
And drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls
For a new sun
A new day has come
A new day has come
Where it was dark now there is light
Where there was pain, now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy
Hush now
I see a light in the sky
Oh it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel

I have no snare on my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you mama? I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time

I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin out my closet, ha""

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye
No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work wit her
At least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today

What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show

I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time

I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha""

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Screw this song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in Hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Spralled out on the bed while I'm yankin' your braids

Baby but you're always on time
Checkin' for one time

You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone

Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy

58,POD,Youth of the Nation,2002,"Last day of the rest of my life I wish I would have known cause i'd have kissed my
momma goobye. I didn't tell her that I loved her or how much cared or thank my
pops for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared. Unaware I just did what I
always do. Everyday the same routine before I skate off to school but who knew
that
this day wasnt like the rest, instead of takin the test I took two to the chest.
Call me blind but I didn't see it comin and everybody was runnin but I couldn't
hear nothin, except gun blast, it happened so fast I didn't really know this kid
though I sat by him in class. Maybe this kid was reachin out for love or maybe
for a moment he forgot who he was or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged,
whatever it was I know its because

CHORUS
We are We are the youth of the nation (repeat)x4

Little Suzzy she was only twelve she was given the world with every chance to
excel
Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell she might act kinda proud
but no respect for herself

She finds love in all the wrong places the same situations but different faces.
Changed up her pace since her daddy left her too bad he never told her she
deserved much better.
Johnny boy always played the fool, he broke all the rules so you would think he
was cool.
He was never really one of the guys no matter how hard he tried, with the
thought of suicide
It's kinda hard when you ain't got no friends, he put his life to an end they
might remember him then.
You cross a line and there is no turnin back he told the world how he felt with
the sound of a gat.

CHORUS x4

Whos to blame for the life that tragedies claim no matter what you say it won't
take away the pain, that I feel inside I'm tired of all the lies don't nobody know
why it's the blind leadin the blind.
Guess that's the way that the story goes, will it ever make sense somebody's
gotta
know, there's gotta be more to life than this, there's got to be more to everything
I thought exists

63,Mariah Carey,Through the Rain,2002,"When you get caught in the rain with nowhere to run
When you are distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes and you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone it's okay once you say

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend

And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain

And if you keep falling down
Don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound
So keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you'll need to prevail
Once you say

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend

And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain

And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say

I, I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend

And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain

I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I'll live one more day
And I, I can make it through the rain

Oh yes you can
You're gonna make it through the rain"

Well I could say, ""Everything's all right""
And I could pretend and say, ""Goodbye""

Got your ticket, got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
Oh, I could say, ""That's the way it goes""
And I could pretend and you won't know that I was lying

'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

We took a taxi to the station
Not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time, I don't know

Feeling humble, heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear the whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know that I'll be crying

'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

He breaks, me down, he builds, me up
He fills, my cup, I like, it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes, in late, but it's, ok
He do, I do, he knows, the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream

(Chorus: Truth Hurts)
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady

(Verse 2: Truth Hurts)
Oh! Tonight he's waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm takin, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I got

He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for

Thinkin of a masterplan, you know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a grand
Now it's kelos to c notes and how fast your grands
We ball like we own the world, your only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathin hard when I'm squeezin your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you try to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill and I'm a quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail will get you boot out
Just me and you high off sex I'm twisted
You OG'd and you OD addicted

(Chorus: Truth Hurts)
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady"

Continue dreaming of our everlastin' friendship
I still believe in me and you, my friends are all, perdono

Look at the joy I'm feeling with my heartbeat
I'm trying to find a way to tell you that I'm crazy
If you don't understand what you mean to me
I know I hurt you so but honey I'm here to let you know

I love you, so to let you know

And now I dedicate to you my song
'Cause if I live without you I'm not strong

I'm your hitting sun and you're my moon
Select me shine just that you know
Believe it's you who I adore
Although your contradictions and defects
I still want your sweet caresses

Perdono, for everything

Here it's cold like at Christmas time
Here it's darker without your smile
All my deeper dreams here are dying
Mars and Venus, here, I'm just crying

Take my glow and give me your moonlight
What I can I do, I don't know
Please come back, I swear that it will last
We'll be dancing flying space

77,John Mayer,No Such Thing,2002,"She said to me condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white

Well, I never lived the dream of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls
Take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits and maybe transfers

They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories tiny tragedies

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for"

Did you meet your fortune teller?
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's always stellar
What a way to finally smell her

Pick it up it's not to strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on

Fly away on my Zephyr

We'll find a place together, fly on my wing

Felt the night you said
That love had come to you

I thought you were not my kind
I thought that I could never feel for you
The passion and love you were feeling
And so you left for someone new
And now that you're far and away
I'm sending a letter today

From Sarah with love
She'd got the lover she is dreaming of
She never found the words to say
But I know that today
She's gonna send her letter to you

From Sarah with love
She took your picture to the stars above
And they told her it is true
She could dare to fall in love with you
So don't make her blue when she writes to you
From Sarah with love

So maybe the chance for romance
Is like a train to catch before it's gone
Maybe it's just an illusion to hold behind
The clouds you'll find the sun

But I'll keep on hoping and praying
There will be a day when we meet again
And I'll keep on waiting and dreaming
You're strong enough to understand
As long as you're so far away
I'm sending a letter each day

She's gonna send her letter to you

From Sarah with love
She took your picture to the stars above
And they told her it is true
She could dare to fall in love with you
So don't make her blue when she writes to you
From Sarah with love

From Sarah with love
She'd got the lover she is dreaming of
She never found the words to say
But I know that today
She's gonna send her letter to you

From Sarah with love
She's gotta know what you are thinking of
'Cause every little now and then
And again and again
I know her heart cries out for you

From Sarah with love
She'd got the lover she is dreaming of
Never found the words to say, ahh
But today, but today

From Sarah with love
She took your picture to the stars above
And they told her it is true
She could dare to fall in love with you
So don't make her blue when she writes to you
From Sarah with love

And they told her it is true
She could dare to fall in love with you
So don't make me blue when I write to you
From Sarah with love"
98,Herbert Gronemeyer,Mensch,2002,"Momentan ist richtig, 
momentan ist gut 
nichts ist wirklich wichtig 
nach der Ebbe kommt die Flut 

am Strand des Lebens 
ohne Grund, ohne Verstand 
ist nichts vergebens 
ich bau die Träume auf den Sand 

und es ist, es ist o.k. 
alles auf dem Weg, 
und es ist Sonnenzeit 
unbeschwert und frei 

und der Mensch heißt Mensch 
weil er vergisst, 
weil er verdrängt 
und weil er staunt und stählt 
weil er wärmt, wenn er erzählt 

und weil er lacht, 
weil er lebt 
du fehlst... 

das Firmament hat geöffnet, 
wolkenlos und ozeanblau 
Telefon, Gas, Elektrik 
unbezahlt, und das geht auch 

teil mit mir deinen Frieden, 
wenn auch nur geborgt 
ich will nicht deine Liebe, 
ich will nur dein Wort 

und es ist, es ist o.k. 
alles auf dem Weg 
und es ist Sonnenzeit 
ungetrübt und leicht 

und der Mensch heißt Mensch 
weil er irrt und weil er kämpft 
und weil er hofft und liebt, 
weil er mitfühlt und vergibt 

und weil er lacht 
und weil er lebt 
du fehlst... 

oh, weil er lacht, 
weil er lebt 
du fehlst... 

es ist, es ist o.k. 
alles auf dem Weg 
und es ist Sonnenzeit 
ungetrübt und leicht 

und der Mensch heißt Mensch 
weil er vergisst, 
weil er verdrängt 

und weil er schwärmt und glaubt, 
sich anlehnt und vertraut 

und weil er lacht 
und weil er lebt 
du fehlst... 

oh, es ist schon o.k. 
es tut gleichmäßig weh 
es ist Sonnenzeit 
ohne Plan, ohne Geleit 

und der Mensch heißt Mensch 
weil er erinnert, weil er kämpft 
und weil er hofft und liebt 
weil er mitfühlt und vergibt 

und weil er lacht, 
und weil er lebt, 
du fehlst... 

oh, weil er lacht, 
weil er lebt, 
du fehlst..."

100,Scooter,Nessaja,2002,"Pitched voice:] Always lived my life alone,
Been searching for the place called home.
I know that I've been cold as ice,
Ignored the dreams, too many lies.
Somewhere deep inside, Somewhere deep inside me,
I found ... the child I used to be
And I know that it's not too late
Never too late...

3 AM!
The painted cow!
Hiaaaaa!!
You ain't stoppin' us now!
Wonderful human beings
Yeah! I am the Junglist souldier.

Come On! The rocket launcher stops ya.
It's not a bird, it's not a plane
It must be Dave who's on the train
Wanna wanna get'cha, gonna gonna get'cha
Tell them that I told ya
YEAH!

Always lived my life alone,
Been searching for the place called home.
I know that I've been cold as ice,
Ignored the dreams, too many lies.
Somewhere deep inside,
Somewhere deep inside me,
I found ... the child I used to be
And I know that it's not too late
Never too late...

Allright
Are you ready? It's not a game.
I chant so much, I turn you insane.
Wanna wanna get'cha, gonna gonna get'cha
Messing up the area
YEAH!

Come On!
I am the freshman
Messing up the jam!
Turning up the stereo
Join the caravan

Skippy, the rain won't come!

Somewhere deep inside,
Somewhere deep inside me,
I found ... the child I used to be
And I know that it's not too late
Never too late..."
