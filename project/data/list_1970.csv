1,The Beatles,Let it Be,1970,"When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be
Ah, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music,
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be"
2,Mungo Jerry,In the Summertime,1970,"In the summertime when the weather is high
You can stretch right up and touch the sky

3,Shocking Blue,Venus,1970,"A Goddess on a mountain top

4,Simon & Garfunkel,Bridge Over Troubled Water,1970,"When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all (all)
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you (ooo)
I'll take your part, oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind"

Goin' up to the spirit in the sky
That's where I'm gonna go when I die
When I die and they lay me to rest

7,The Kinks,Lola,1970,"I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola
C-O-L-A, Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L-O-L-A, Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine, oh my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man, oh my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said ""Dear boy, won't you come home with me?""
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me

Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, sup world, except for Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Well, I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said ""Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man""

Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

8,B J Thomas,Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head,1970,"Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothin's worryin' me

It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothin's worryin' me"
9,Creedence Clearwater Revival,Up Around the Bend,1970,"There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the gettin's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Come along, come along with me

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do

10,Carpenters,(They Long to Be) Close to You,1970,"Carpenters

	and the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust

And starlight in your eyes of blue.

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around

Close to you.

15,The Partridge Family,I Think I Love You,1970,"I was sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread.
I think I love you

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room.
I think I love you

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for
I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way.

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for
I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way.

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

Now honey, that's quite a different subject

But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Really I'm sad, sadder than sad
You're gone and I'm hurtin' so bad
Like a clown, I pretend to be glad

Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around

Oh yeah baby

Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride I try
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness

But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you
Decided to go, oh, I need you so
I'm hurt and I want you to know
But for others I put on a show

Ooh, oh there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around, oh yeah

Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid, smiling in the public eye
But in my lonely room I cry the tears of a clown
When there's no one around

Oh yeah baby

Now if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care
Really I'm sad, hurtin' so bad"

All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me

You took me from the shelter of my mother
I had never known or loved any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold

In the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom

People think I'm insane, because I am frowning all the time.

All day long I think of things, but nothing seems to satisfy.
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah.

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find.
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind.

Make a joke, and I will sigh, and you will laugh, and I will cry.
Happiness I cannot feel, and love to me is so unreal.

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state.
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late."

To come

Clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground.
Good men through the ages tryin' to find the sun.
And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain.

I went down Virginia seekin' shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable I watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals wrapped in golden chains.
And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain.

Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more.
The crowd had rushed together tryin' to keep warm.
Still the rain kept pourin', fallin' on my ears
And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain."

All the children of the world
Pretty yellow, black and white
They are precious in his sight

Everything is beautiful in it's own way

On a snow covered winter's day
And everybody's beautiful in an own way
Under God's Heaven
The world's gonna find the way

There is none so blind
As He who will not see
We must not close up minds
We must let our thoughts be free

For every hour that passes by
You know the world gets a little bit older
It's time to realize that people lies
In the eyes of the beholder

And everything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day, sing it children
Everybody's beautiful in an own way
Under God's Heaven
The world's gonna find a way

We shouldn't care about the length of His hair
Of the color of His skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives within

And we're gonna get old again now
Everything is gonna work out fine
Just take a little time to the look on the good side my friend
And spittle in out in your mind

And everything is beautiful in it's own way

On a snow covered winter's day, sing it children

41,Eric Burdon & ,Spill the Wine,1970,"Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
in a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face

And I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind, the fact that me,
an overfed, long-haired leaping gnome
should be the star of a Hollywood movie

But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones...

Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear something crazy
She said:

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

(spoken:)
I thought to myself what could that mean
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream
Now, wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
so it's all in my head
and then. I heard her say one more time:

(sung:)
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

(spoken:)
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said:

(sung:)
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl"

45,Clarence Carter,Patches,1970,"(Spoken:)
I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it 'Course deep down inside
He was hurt 'cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
He said ""Patches, I'm depending on you son,
To pull the family through,
My son, it's all left up to you""

(Spoken:)
Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was daddy's strictest rule

So every morning 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best,
It's up to you to do the rest""

(Spoken:)
Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through, 'cause

Everyday I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray
""Lord, give him strength to make another day""
Though years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took mama to a brand new home
Lord knows people, I shed a tear
My daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son,
To pull the family through,
My son, it's all left up to you""

Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin'
""Patches, I'm depending on you son,
I tried to do my best,
It's up to you to do the rest"".

I could still hear papa when he's sayin'
""Patches, I'm depending on you son,
To pull the family through,
My son, it's all left up to you""

I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
Lose the the love I knew, could safely lead me through

Between the silence of the mountains
And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me

But in the grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead and the sleeping
And the road that I must choose

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew, could safely lead me to
The land that I once knew
To learn as we grow old the secrets of our souls

When you do those things to me
It's more the way you really mean it
When you tell me what will be

I really think that we could make it girl

No, you don't know me well
And every little thing only time will tell
If you believe the things that I do
And we'll see it through

Life can be short or long
Love can be right or wrong
And if I choose the one
I'd like to help me through

I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it girl

Baby you know that dreams they're for those who sleep
Life is for us to keep
And if I choose the one
I'd like to help me through

I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it girl"
56,Tom Jones,Without Love (There Is Nothing),1970,"I awakened this morning, I was filled with despair
All my dreams turned to ashes and gone, oh yeah
As I looked at my life it was barren and bare

Without love I've had nothing at all
Without love I've had nothing
Without love I've had nothing at all
I have conquered the world
All but one thing did I have
Without love I've had nothing at all

Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me
There was nothing, oh that she would not give, oh no
But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see
That a heart without love cannot live

Without love I've had nothing
Without love I've had nothing at all
I have conquered the world
All but one thing did I have
Without love I've had nothing at all"

59,Chicago,25 Or 6 to 4,1970,"Waiting for the break of day
Searching for something to say
Flashing lights against the sky
Giving up I close my eyes
Sitting cross-legged on the floor
Twenty-five or six to four

Staring blindly into space
Getting up to splash my face
Wanting just to stay awake
Wond'ring how much I can take
Should I try to do some more
Twenty-five or six to four

Feeling like I ought to sleep
Spinning room is sinking deep
Searching for something to say
Waiting for the break of day

Twenty-five or six to four
Twenty-five or six to four"
60,Shocking Blue,Never Marry a Railroad Man,1970,"Have you been broken-hearted once or twice
If it's yes how did you feel at his first lies
If it's no you need this good advice

Never marry a Railroad man
He loves you every now and then
His heart is at his new train.
No, no, no
Don't fall in love with a Railroad man
If you do forget him if you can
You're better off without him

ah...
Have you ever been restless in your bed
And so lonely that your eyes became wet
Let me tell you then one thing mmm...
mmm...

mmm...

No, no, no
Never marry a Railroad man
He loves you every now and then
His heart is at his new train. No, no, no
Don't fall in love with a Railroad man
If you do forget him if you can
You're better off without him
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no"

62,Brook Benton,Rainy Night in Georgia,1970,"Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
Heavy rain fallin', seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
It seems like it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a-flashin'
Taxi cabs and buses passin' through the night
A distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life and you just got to play the game

I find me a place in a box car
So I take my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest and I feel fine

But it's a rainy night in Georgia
Baby, it's a rainy night in Georgia
I feel it's rainin' all over the world
Kinda lonely now and it's rainin' all over the world

Oh, have you ever been lonely, people?
And you feel that it was rainin' all over this man's world
You're talking 'bout rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin'
Rainin', rainin' rainin', rainin', rainin' rainin' rainin' over the world
I said now, rainin', rainin' rainin'"
63,Brian Hyland,Gypsy Woman,1970,"From nowhere through a caravan around the campfire light
The big woman in motion with hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love

She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round to a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow, how she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman

All through the caravan, she was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun, everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go knowing she'll never know
That I love her, I love her

Gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman"
64,Fifth Dimension,One Less Bell To Answer,1970,"One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy

But all I do is cry
(Cry, cry, no more laughter)
I should be happy
(Oh, why did he go)
Since he left my life's so empty

Though I try to forget it just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him

'Cause I still love him so
I spend each day the way I start out
Crying my heart out
One less man to pick up after

No more laughter, no more love
Since he went away
(He went away, one less bell to answer)
Why did he leave me?
(Why, why, why did he leave?)

Now I've got one less egg to fry
(One less bell to answer)
One less egg to fry
(Why, why, why did he leave?)
And all I do is cry
(One less bell to answer)

Because a man told me goodbye
(Why, why, why did he leave?)
(One less bell to answer)
Somebody tell me please
Where did he go, why did he go?
(Why, why, why did he leave?)
How could he leave me?"
65,Tom Jones,Daughter of Darkness,1970,"Woman, I can remember a woman
Warm were her kisses and tender was she lying there in my arms
Why
Why, did you deceive me so?
What devil inside made you go when I needed you most of all-ll
Oh Daughter of Darkness
Stay out of my life, my life
You took my heart and broke it apart, you daughter of darkness
Daughter of darkness
Please, leave me alone forever
Daughter of darkness, gone is the love that we shared together
Heaven, we had our own kind of heaven
Sharing together the magic of love in a world of our own
Then oh so suddenly you were gone
The love I depended upon disappeared when you weren't away-ay

Stay on the scene like a sex machine
You got to have the feeling sure as you're born
Get it together right on, right on

Get up, get on up

I said the feeling you got to get
Give me the fever in a cold sweat
The way I like it is the way it is
I got mine and don't worry 'bout his

Get on up and then shake your money maker
Shake your money maker"
67,Sly & The Family Stone,Thank You (Falettinme be Mice Elf Again),1970,"Lookin' at the devil grinnin' at his gun

Bullets start chasin', I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle, I was on the top

I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin

Stiff all in the collar, fluffy in the face
Chit chat chatter tryin', stuffy in the place
Thank you for the party but I could never stay
Many thangs is on my mind, words in the way

I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin

Dance to the music all night long
Everyday people, sing a simple song
Mama's so happy, mama starts to cry
Papa's still singin', you can make it if you try

I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin

Flamin' eyes of people fear burnin' into you
Many men are missin' much, hatin' what they do
Youth and truth are makin' love, dig it for a starter, now
Dyin' young is hard to take, sellin' out is harder

Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin

And our love will surely grow
Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow

Life's too short to make a mistake
Let's think of each other and hesitate
Young and impatient we may be
There's no need to act foolishly
If we part, our hearts won't forget it
Years from now we'll surely regret it

Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow

You're young, and you're in a hurry
You're eager for love, but don't you worry
We both want the sweetness in life
But these things don't come overnight
Don't give up 'cause love's been slow
Girl, we gonna succeed with another blow

Just give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Baby, please, baby
Baby, please, baby

Love is that mountain we must climb
Let's climb it together, your hand in mine
We haven't known each other too long
But the feeling I have is oh so strong
I know we can make it, there's no doubt
We owe it to ourselves to find it out

Just give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow, brr

You'll always have me

And if you should miss my lovin
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close, or the lips
That used to touch you so tenderly

The day I set you free

Took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged all the people a dollar and a half, just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go?
You don't know what you've got till it's gone

Hey farmer, farmer, put away that DDT now
Give me spots on my apples, leave me the birds and the bees
Please, don't it always seem to go?
You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and they put up a parking lot

Late last night, I heard that scream door slam
And a big yellow tractor come and pushed around my house
Pushed around my land
I said, ""Don't it always seem to go?""
You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and they put up a parking lot

Late last night, I heard that scream door slam again
And a big yellow taxi come and took away my old man, again
Don't it always seem to go?
You don't know what you've got till it's gone
They paved paradise and they put up a parking lot
Oh they paved paradise and they put up those parking lots

Could this be love that's calling?
The door is always open wide.Knock knock - who's there?

Take off your coat and come inside.

Climb the stair and then I say a prayer,
For someone who could share my situation.
But instead as I lay down my head,
I have to leave it all to my imagination
