1,Abba,Dancing Queen,1976,"You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh see that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat
From the tambourine, oh yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh see that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat
From the tambourine, oh yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh see that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
Dig in the dancing queen"
2,Queen,Bohemian Rhapsody,1976,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy

Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time

Goodbye everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth

Mama, ooh
(Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
(Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Figaro)
Magnifico

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go!
(Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go!
(Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go!
(Let me go!)
Will not let you go!
(Let me go!)
(Never never never never let me go!)
Will not let you go!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside
For me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows"
3,Chicago,If You Leave Me Now,1976,"If you leave me now you'll take away the biggest part of me
No baby please don't go
And if you leave me now you'll take away the very heart of me
No baby please don't go, no I just want you to stay

A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away?
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way?
When tomorrow comes and we both regret
The things we said today

A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away?
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way?
When tomorrow comes and we both regret
The things we said today

And if you leave me now you'll take away the biggest part of me
No baby please don't go, no baby please don't go
Oh girl, I just got to have your lovin, yeah
No baby please don't go, don't go, don't go"

5,Abba,Fernando,1976,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando, you were humming to yourself
And softly strumming your guitar, I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando, we were young and full of life
And none of us prepared to die and I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night, the stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me for liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose, there's no regret
If I had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and gray Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night the stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me for liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose, there's no regret
If I had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night, the stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me for liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose, there's no regret
If I had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando
Yes if had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando
If had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando"
6,The Four Seasons,December 1963 (Oh What a Night),1976,"Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I
I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
Hey, my
As I recall, it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night

Oh, I
Got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
Hey, my
As I recall, it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night (Do do do do do, do do do do)
Oh, what a night (Do do do do do, do do do do)
Oh, what a night (Do do do do do, do do do do)
Oh, what a night (Do do do do do, do do do do)
Oh, what a night (Do do do do do, do do do do)
Oh, what a night (Do do do do do, do do do do)
Oh, what a night (Do do do do do, do do do do)"
7,The Manhattans,Kiss & Say Goodbye,1976,"This has got to be the saddest day of my life
I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you anymore
Because of my obligations, and the ties that you have
We've been meeting here everyday
And since this is our last day together
I wanna hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away, don't look back
I wanna remember you just like this
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me 'til I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done, oh was wrong
Please darlin', don't you cry

Let's just kiss and say goodbye (Goodbye)
Many months have passed us by
(I'm gonna miss you)
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)
I've got ties, and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet, you'll meet another guy

Understand me, won't you try, try, try, try, try, try, try

Let's just kiss and say goodbye (Goodbye)
(I'm gonna miss you)
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)
Understand me, won't you try
(I'm gonna miss you)
It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)
Take my hankerchief, wipe your eyes
(I'm gonna miss you)
Maybe you'll find, you'll find another guy
(I'm gonna miss you)
Let's kiss and say goodbye, pretty baby
(I'm gonna miss you)
Please, don't you cry
(I'm gonna miss you)
Understand me, won't you try
(I'm gonna miss you)
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye"
8,Rod Stewart,Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright),1976,"Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door too
Disconnect the telephone line
Relax baby and draw that blind

Kick off your shoes and sit right down
Loosen off that pretty French gown
Let me pour you a good long drink
Ooh baby don't you hesitate cause

Tonights the night
It's gonna be alright
Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

C'mon angel my hearts on fire
Don't deny your man's desire
You'd be a fool to stop this tide
Spread your wings and let me come inside

Tonights the night
It's gonna be alright
Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

Don't say a word my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild
The secret is about to unfold
Upstairs before the night's too old

Tonights the night
It's gonna be alright
Cause I love you woman
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now"
9,Wings,Silly Love Songs,1976,"You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
I look around me and I see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

I can't explain the feeling's plain to me; can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me now can't you see?
What's wrong with that?
I need to know
'Cause here I go again
I love you, I love you

Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, love isn't silly, love isn't silly at all

How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
""I love you"" over Paul's ""How can I tell you about my loved one?""
""I love you"" over Paul's ""How can I tell you about my loved one?""

I love you
I love you
""I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?""
""I love you""

11,Bellamy Brothers,Let Your Love Flow,1976,"There's a reason for the sun shiny sky
And there's a reason why I'm feelin' so high
Must be the season
When that love light shines all around us
So let that feelin' grab you deep inside
And send you reelin' where your love can't hide
And then go stealin'
Through the summer nights with your lover

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean, it's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on the wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean, that's the reason

There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candle lights
Must be the season
When those love rites shine all around us
So let the wonder take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face
You can't hold back
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams and let your love show
And you'll know what I mean, it's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on the wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean, that's the reason

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams

To pay the bills I have to pay

A single penny left for me
That's too bad

In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world

Ah, all the things I could do
If I had a little money

A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad

So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life would never be the same

15,Pussycat,Mississippi,1976,"Where you can hear a country song from far
and someone plays the honky-tonk guitar
Where all the lights will go out one by one
the people join the sun
and the wind takes it away

Where the Mississippi rolls down to the sea
and lovers found the place they'd like to be
how many times before the song was ending
love and understanding
everywhere around

Mississippi, I'll remember you
whenever I should go away
I'll be longing for the day

Mississippi, you'll be on my mind
everytime I hear this song
Mississippi roll along

Now the country song for ever lost its soul

I always will be calling dreams of yesterday

16,Nazareth,Love Hurts,1976,"Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds, and marks
Any heart, not tough
Or strong enough

To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain

Love hurts
Love hurts

I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I learned, from you

I really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot

Love hurts
Love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not foolin' me

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue

Love hurts
Love hurts
Love hurts

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue

Love hurts
Love hurts
Love hurts"

And colour you in

We could frame it
And put you on a wall

And it's so hard to say it
But i've been here before
Now i'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down

Driver take away my worries of today
And leave tomorrow behind

Fly me high through the starry skies
Maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy
Help me to forget today's pain

Ooh, dream weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, dream weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Though the dawn may be coming soon
There still may be some time
Fly me away to the bright side of the moon
And meet me on the other side

I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, dream weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Giving you what you hadn't planned

I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I'd come there for

Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways

69,Bob Dylan,Hurricane,1976,"Pistol shots ring out in the ballroom night Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall She sees the bartender in a pool of blood Cries out, ""My God, they've killed them all!"" Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand.
I saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops"" And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked likemiddleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates""
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head Cop said: ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men

Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, ""Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!""
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame.
""Remember that murder that happened in a bar?""
""Remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""You think you'd like to play ball with the law?""
""Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?""
""Don't forget that you are white""

Arthur Dexter Bradley said:""I'm really not sure""
Cops said:""A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
You'll be doin' society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no gentleman jim""

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder ""one,"" guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
That's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name And give him back the time he's done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world"

74,The Real Thing,You to Me Are Everything,1976,"I would take the stars out of the sky for you
Stop the rain from falling if you asked me to
I'd do anything for you, your wish is my command
I could move a mountain when your hand is in my hand

Words cannot express how much you mean to me
There must be some other way to make you see
If it takes my heart and soul you know I'd pay the price
Everything that I possess I'd gladly sacrifice

Oh, you to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby
To you I guess I'm just a clown
Who picks you up each time you're down
Oh baby, oh baby

You give me just a taste of love
To build my hopes upon
You know you've got the power girl
To keep me holding on
So now you've got the best of me
Come on and take the rest of me, oh baby

Though you're close to me we seem so far apart
Maybe given time you'll have a change of heart
If it takes forever, girl, then I'm prepared to wait
The day you give your love to me won't be a day too late

Oh, you to me are everything
The sweetest song that I can sing
Oh baby, oh baby
To you I guess I'm just a clown
Who picks you up each time you're down

75,Eagles,Take it to the Limit,1976,"All alone at the end of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman
Who might have loved me, and I never knew

You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?

And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
One more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
One more time

76,Billy Ocean,Love Really Hurts Without You,1976,"You run around town like a fool and you think that it's groovy
You're givin' it to some other guy who gives you the eye
You don't give nothin' to me
You painted a smile and you dress all the while to excite me
But don't you know you're turning me on? I know that it's wrong
But I can't stop the pain inside me

Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart but what can I do?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart but what can I do?

You walk like a dream and you make like you're Queen of the action
You're using every trick in the book, the way that you look
You're really something to see
You cheat and you lie to impress any guy that you fancy
But don't you know I'm out of my mind? So give me a sign
And help to ease the pain inside me

Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart but what can I do?

77,Keith Carradine,I'm Easy,1976,"It's not my way to love you just when no one's looking.
it's not my way to take your hand if i'm not sure,
it's not my way to let you see what's going on inside of me,
when it's a love you'll not be needing, you're not free.
please stop pulling at my sleeve if you're just playing,
if you'll not take the things you make me want to give,
i never cared too much for games and this one's driving me insane.
you're not half as free to wander as you claim.
i'm easy, i'm easy. say the word, i'll play your game,
as though that's how it ought to be. i'm easy.
don't lead me on if there's nowhere for you to take me,
if loving you will have to be a sometime thing.
i can't put bars on my insides; my love is something i can't hide
i still hurt when i recall the times i've tried. i'm easy, i'm easy.
take my hand and pull me down.
i won't put up any fight, because i'm easy.
don't do me favors, let me watch you from a distance,
cause when you're near, it's hard for me to keep my head.
when your eyes throw light at mine, it's enough to change my mind
make me leave my cautious ways and world behind.
i'm easy. i'm easy."

85,Gordon Lightfoot,The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,1976,"The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called 'Gitche Gumee'
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy

With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned

Concluding some terms with a couple steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
When a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'

The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When supper time came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya
At seven pm a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good t'know ya

The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searches all say they'd have made whitefish bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her

They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen

And farther below lake Ontario
Takes in what lake Erie can send her
The iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call 'Gitche Gumee'
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early"

Yellow
red
black or white
add a little bit of moonlight
For this intercontinental romance.
Shy girl
sexy girl
they all like that fancy world
Champagne
a gentle song and a slow dance.
Who makes it fun to spend your money

Who calls you honey
most every day.
Girls, girls, girls (2x)
Well
they made 'em up in Hollywood
and put them into the movie
Those lovely photographic splendors;
In and out of magazines
Miss World and beauty queens
Falling in love with the real big spenders.
But although their world may be frantic
They're still romantic
in their own way.

refrain:
So hop on
the world is swinging.
Don't sit and twiddle your thumbs.
Get up and meet those pretty
Girls, girls, girls
Step on
the world keeps swinging.
Put on the dazzling charm.
Get up and find those pretty girls.
But don't rush
keep it nice and gentle
And sentimental
for that certain moment.

Moonlit oceans
girls full of emotions
Stepping on that slow boat to China;
And next door
in Japan
they know how to please a man
Dropping in for tea with my geisha.
They've got that old-fashioned feeling
When it comes to pleasing
they know their way.

refrain

When you draw back the curtain.
Hop on
the world is swinging.
Don't sit and twiddle your thumbs.
Get up and meet those pretty girls."
92,Smokie,I'll Meet You At Midnight,1976,"A summer evening on Les Champs Elyses
A secret rendezvous they planned for days.
A sea of faces in a crowded cafe
A sound of laughter as the music plays.

...
Jean-Claude was a student at the University
Louise-Marie is just a world away.
...

He recall the night they met was warm with laughter
The words were music as she turned away.
...
I'll meet you at midnight

Under the moonlight
I'll meet you at midnight...
But Jean-Claude, Louise-Marie will never be...
...

Each cigarette would light a thousand faces
...
Each hour that pass seem like a thousand years.
...

Midnight was turning into empty spaces
The sound of laughter disappeared.
...
I'll meet you at midnight

Under the moonlight
I'll meet you at midnight...
Oh, but Jean-Claude, Louise-Marie will never be...

...
A summer morning on Les Champs Elyses
The empty table in the street cafe.
...
The sunlight melting through an open doorway
Jean-Claude has left to face another day.
...
I'll meet you at midnight
Under the moonlight
I'll meet you at midnight...
...
I'll meet you at midnight
Under the moonlight
I'll meet you at midnight...
Oh, but Jean-Claude, Louise-Marie will never be ...

93,The Beatles,Got to Get You Into My Life,1976,"I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You know I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do? What can I be?
When I'm with you I wanna stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you

And now the marriage vow is very sacred
The man has put us together now
You ought to make it stick together
Come on, come on, let's stick together
You know we made a vow to leave one another never
But now you never miss your water 'til your well runs dry
Come on now baby give our love a try
Let´s stick together, c´mon c´mon let´s stick together
You know we made a vow to leave one another never
Then if you´re stuck for a while consider our child
How can it be happy without its ma and pa
Let´s stick together, c´mon c´mon let´s stick together
You know we made a vow to leave one another never"

99,Bee Gees,Love So Right,1976,"She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me, we were free
She moved in like a friend, started loving me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up, I was here and she was gone
Now I'm hanging on, maybe you can tell me

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong?

Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on, on the chance that you'll come back to me

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?

I could take it in my stride, start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
It isn't really fair

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?"
