1,Adele,Hello,2015,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Oooooh, anymore
Oooooh, anymore
Oooooh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore"
2,The Weeknd,Can't Feel My Face,2015,"And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

She told me, ""Don't worry about it""
She told me, ""Don't worry no more""
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come

All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know, girl, I know
She told me, ""Don't worry about it""
She told me, ""Don't worry no more""

We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
She told me, ""Don't worry about it""
She told me, ""Don't worry no more""
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh"
3,Wiz Khalifa & Charlie Puth,See You Again,2015,"It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
About another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different
See the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

Oh
How could we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turned into a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

How could we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home
Home

It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

When I see you again
See you again
When I see you again"
4,Justin Bieber,What Do You Mean?,2015,"What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive, what I'm saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know…

What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You want to make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know…

What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
(I wanna know)
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
(Oh baby)
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

Oh, oh
(This is ours baby, yeah)
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
(You're so confusing baby)
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
(Be more straight forward)
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?"
5,Taylor Swift,Bad Blood,2015,"'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (hey!)

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood (hey!)

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shining now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where
I'm weak, baby, I couldn't breathe
I rubbed it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (hey!)

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood (hey!)

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you come in my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (hey!)

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood (hey!)

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts, ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey!)
You say sorry just for show (hey!)
You live like that, you live with ghosts (hey!)
Hm, if you love like that blood runs

(Bad) 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (bad)

(Blood) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood

('Cause now we got bad blood) 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done (look at what you've done)
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (woah)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood (hey!)"

34,Sekai no Owari,SOS,2015,"For you, I'll sing this song
Please stay, it won't last long
Years after we are long gone
The meaning will stay strong

Silence is what this song's about
Numb to the world all around
But I will sing of this place
Hoping it finds you some way

People needing to be saved
Scream out for help every day
But we grow numb to the sounds
And feelings slowly start to drown

The first time, we can hear a voice
But soon it all becomes noise
Fading to silence in the end
I know it doesn't make sense…

When sound all ceases to exist
People think that means happiness
And all the sounds that used to be
Are all just noise to you and me

The cries of help disappear
The silence numbs all of our ears
And when we stop listening
Those screams stop meaning anything

Don't you let your heart grow numb to everyone
Oh child, listen to the ""sound of silence""
Saving someone else means saving yourself
It's true, and I'm sure you know it too

When you hear an ""SOS""
Answering it becomes a test
It can give the life you lead
A meaning that you'd never seen

So don't resist a call for help
Cause in the end it will tell you
How to treasure yourself
And not be alone

It might seem a little strange
To share this song this way
But I know what I must do
Is share the meaning with you

All this I learned from someone
Who spent his life among
People screaming out for help
Doing everything to reach out
Don't you let your heart grow numb to everyone
Oh child, listen to the ""sound of silence""
Saving someone else means saving yourself
It's true, and I'm sure you know it too
Don't you let your heart grow numb to everyone
Oh child, listen to the ""sound of silence""
Saving someone else means saving yourself
It's true, and I'm sure you know it too
Now I'd like to thank you for staying by my side…"

I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

52,Meghan Trainor & John Legend,Like I'm Gonna Lose You,2015,"I found myself dreaming in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone

I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

In the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything, the truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer baby, any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret

So let's take our time to say what we want
Use what we got before it's all gone
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you"
53,Justin Bieber,Love Yourself,2015,"For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"
54,Major Lazer & DJ Snake,Lean On,2015,"Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other

But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on"

56,Justin Bieber,Sorry,2015,"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh

59,Rihanna,FourFiveSeconds,2015,"I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', ""How could I be so selfish?""
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' ""How could I be so reckless?""
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand

If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

60,OMI,Cheerleader,2015,"When I need motivation
My one solution is my Queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah

She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone

And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really, 'cause

Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

She is always right there when I need her

She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle

She gives me love and affection
Baby, did I mention you're the only girl for me?
No, I don't need a next one

Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection

We've put us to the test
And we've failed each one
So i'm cleaning out the back seat
Getting my stuff
Please stop me when I leave
But I know that you won't
And this is inside out
I want the best but our love is lost
And this is inside out
I want you here but all we have is gone
And this is inside out
I want the best but our love is lost
And this is inside out
I want you here but all we have is gone
One move and my hat keeps dragging me down
I'm tryin speak but the words gets stuck in my hands
And i've been dreaming if the lies
Would stay as I could
But i'm never coming home
Could just so you know
And this is inside out
I want the best but our love is lost
And this is inside out
I want you here but all we have is gone
And this is inside out
I want the best but our love is lost
And this is inside out
I want you here but all we have is gone

And this is inside out
I want the best but our love is lost
