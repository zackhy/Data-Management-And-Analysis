Somethin' tells me, I'm into something good

She danced close to me like I hoped she would

Somethin' tells me, I'm into something good

Can I be fallin' in love
She's everything, I've been dreamin' of
She's evertyhing, I've been dreamin' of

I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could

54,Lorne Greene,Ringo,1964,"He lay face down in the desert sand
Clutching his six-gun in his hand
Shot from behind, I thought he was dead
But under his heart was an ounce of lead
But a spark still burned so I used my knife
And late that night, I saved the life of Ringo

Ringo, Ringo

I nursed him till the danger passed
The days went by, he mended fast
Then from dawn till setting sun
He practiced with that deadly gun
And hour on hour, I watched in awe
No human being could match the draw of Ringo

Ringo, Ringo

One day, we rode the mountain crest
And I went east and he went west
I took to law and wore a star
While he spread terror near and far
With lead and blood, he gained such fame
All thought the West they feared the name of Ringo

Ringo, Ringo

I knew someday, I'd face the test
Which one of us would be the best
And sure enough the word came down
That he was holed up in the town
I left the posse out in the street
And I went in alone to meet Ringo

Ringo, Ringo

They said my speed was next to none
But my lightning draw had just begun
When I heard a blast that stung my wrist
The gun went flying from my fist
And I was looking down the bore
Of the deadly .44 of Ringo

Ringo, Ringo

They say that was the only time
That anyone had seen him smile
He slowly lowered his gun and then
He said to me, ""We're even, friend""
And so at last, I understood
That there was still a spark of good in Ringo

Ringo, Ringo

I blocked the path of his retreat
He turned and stepped into the street
A dozen guns spit fire and lead
A moment later, he lay dead
The town began to shout and cheer
Nowhere was there shed a tear for Ringo

Ringo, Ringo

The story spread throughout the land
That I had beaten Ringo's hand
And it was just the years, they say
That made me put my guns away
But on his grave they can't explain
The tarnished star above the name of Ringo

Ringo, Ringo
Ringo, Ringo"
55,Jay & the Americans,Come a Little Bit Closer,1964,"In a little cafe
Just the other side of the border
She was just sitting there givin' me looks
That made my mouth water

She belonged to bad man, Jose

When I heard her say, yeah

Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long

So we started to dance
In my arms, she felt so inviting
And I just couldn't resist
Just one little kiss, so exciting

Then I heard the guitar player say
""Vamoose, Jose's on his way""
Then I knew, yes I knew I should run
But then I heard her say, yeah

Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long

Then the music stopped
When I looked the cafe was empty
Then I heard Jose say
""Man, you know you're in trouble plenty""

So I dropped my drink from my hand
And through the window I ran
And as I rode away
I could hear her say to Jose, yeah

Resting in mine

57,Chuck Berry,No Particular Place to Go,1964,"Ridin' along in my automobile
My baby beside me at the wheel
I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile
My curiosity runnin' wild
Cruisin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go

Ridin' along in my automobile
I was anxious to tell her the way I feel
So I told her softly and sincere
And she leaned and whispered in my ear
Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow
With no particular place to go

No particular place to go
So we parked way out on the Kokomo
The night was young and the moon was bold
So we both decided to take a stroll
Can you imagine the way I felt?
I couldn't unfasten her safety belt

Ridin' along in my calaboose
Still tryin' to get her belt a-loose
All the way home I held a grudge
For the safety belt that wouldn't budge
Cruisin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go"

You can't fool me 'cause I'm gonna know if you hide
And try to peek, I'm gonna treat you to a movie
Stop your gigglin', children do be nice like little sugars and spice

You saw me kissin' your sister
You saw me holdin' her hand
But if you snitch to your mother
Your father won't understand

I wish they would take a nap, little children
Now why don't you go bye-bye? Go anywhere at all
Little children, I know you would go if you tried
Go up the stairs, me and your sister, we're goin' steady
How can I kiss her when I'm ready to with little children like you around?
I wonder what can I do around little children like you"

Never forget the sound that night

The painful scream that I heard last

""Hold me darling for a little while""
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love my life, that night

I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true, I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me, asked if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms and I didn't stand a chance

Now listen, honey, I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care

I got a girl and she wants a lot of love
That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of
We'll kiss all night, I'll squeeze her tight
But we'll be kissin' cousins an' that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
But we'll be kissin' cousins that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
Yeah we're all cousins, that's what I believe
Because we're all children of Adam and Eve
I got a girl and she wants a lot of love
That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of
We'll kiss all night, I'll squeeze her tight
And we'll be kissin' cousins an' that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
We'll be kissin' cousins that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right"
99,Dean Martin,The Door Is Still Open To My Heart,1964,"(And the door is still open to my heart)
I must confess that I cry from loneliness
And the door is still open to my heart
You are to me like honey is to the bee
And the door is still open to my heart

I'm not ashamed to cry, it's better then to hold it inside
And I won't be satisfied until you're here by my side
You're as close to me as two is to three
And the door is still open to my heart

I'm not ashamed to cry, it's better than to hold it inside
And I won't be satisfied until you're here by my side
You're as close to me as two is to three
And the door is still open to my heart
And the door is still open to my heart
To my heart"
100,Chubby Checker,"Hey, Bobba Needle",1964,"This is a sad story about a girl named Mary Mac
And her wondering lover Bob Needle

Softly I can hear her callin'
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bob, hey, Bob

Mary Mac, Mac, Mac
All dressed in black, black, black
Don't cha know I'm tryin', tryin', tryin'
Just to come on back, back, back

'Cause I took a plane, plane, plane
But there was some rain, rain, rain
And there was no flyin', flyin', flyin'
So I took a train, train, train

Oh, Mary Mac, Mac, Mac
It went off the track, track, track
Can't you see I'm dyin', dyin', dyin'
Just to come on back, back, back

Oh, softly I can hear you callin'
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bob, hey, Bob

Well, I took a boat, boat, boat
But it wouldn't float, float, float
So I kept on a puffin', puffin', puffin'
That was all she wrote, wrote, wrote

So I must wear my cross, cross, cross
And I bought a horse, horse, horse
But it just keeps runnin', runnin', runnin'
All around the track, track, track

Baby, I ain't lyin', lyin', lyin'
Can't you see that I'm tryin', tryin', tryin'
Don't cha know I'm tryin', tryin', tryin'
Just to come on back to Mary Mac

Oh, softly I can hear her holler
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle, Bobba Needle
Hey, Bob, hey, Bob"
