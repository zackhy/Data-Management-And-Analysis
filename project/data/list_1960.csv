1,Elvis Presley,Are You Lonesome Tonight?,1960,"Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day?
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweet heart

Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to change, you acted strange
And why? I've never known

Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than I go on living without you

Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight"
2,Elvis Presley,It's Now Or Never,1960,"It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait.

When I first saw you
with your smile so tender
My heart was captured
my soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime
waiting for the right time
Now that your near
the time is here at last.

It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait.

Just like a willow
we would cry an ocean
If we lost true love
and sweet devotion
Your lips excite me
let your arms invite me
For who knows when
we'll meet again this way

It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait
it's now or never
My love won't wait."
3,Chubby Checker,The Twist,1960,"Come on, baby, let's do the twist
Come on, baby, let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand and go like this

Yeah, twist, baby, baby
Twist, ooh yeah, just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist

My daddy is sleepin' and mama ain't around
Yeah, daddy's just sleepin' and mama ain't around
We're gonna twisty, twisty, twisty
Till we tear the house down

Come on and twist, yeah, baby
Twist, ooh yeah, just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist, yeah

Yeah, you should see my little sis
You should see my, my little sis
She really knows how to rock
She knows how to twist

Come on and twist, yeah, baby
Twist, ooh yeah, just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist

Yeah, rock on now
Yeah, twist on now, twist"
4,Percy Faith,Theme From 'A Summer Place',1960,"There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm

For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care for it knows

There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love

And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere

When two people share
All their hopes, all their dreams
All their love

There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm

In your arms, in your arms
In your arms, in your arms
In your arms, in your arms"
5,Rocco Granata,Marina,1960,"you're hard to hug
tough to talk to
and I'll never fall asleep
when you're in my bed
all you give me is a heartbeat
I've turned into a statue
and it makes me feel depressed
cause the only time you open up is when we get undressed

you don't love me
big fucking deal
I'll never tell you how I feel
you don't love me
not a big deal
I'll never tell you how i feel

It almost feels like a joke
to play out a part
when you are not the starring role in someone else's heart
you know I'd rather walk alone
than play a supporting role
if I can't get a starring role

sometimes I ignore you
so I'll feel in control
cause really
I adore you
and I can't leave you alone

fed up with the fantasies
they cover what is wrong

c'mon baby let's just get drunk
forget we don't get on

you're like my dad
you get on well
I sing my best
regards from hell

It almost feels like a joke
to play out a part
when you are not the starring role in someone else's heart
you know I'd rather walk alone
than play a supporting role
If I can't get starring role

I never send for love
i never had a heart to mend
because before the start began
i always saw the end

I wait for you to open up
to give yourself to me
but nothing's ever gonna give up
never set you free
yeah I'll never set you free

It almost feels like a joke
to play out a part
when you are not the starring role in someone else's heart
you know I'd rather walk alone
than play a supporting role
If I can't get starring role"
6,The Everly Brothers,Cathy's Clown,1960,"Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time
I hear this sound:
""Here he comes. That's Cathy's clown.""

I've gotta stand tall
You know a man can't crawl
But when he knows you're tellin' lies
And he hears them passing' by
He's not a man at all

Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time
I hear this sound:
""Here he comes. That's Cathy's clown.""

When you see me shed a tear
And you know that it's sincere
Don't you think it's kind of sad
That you're treating me so bad
Or don't you even care?

Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time
I hear this sound:
""Here he comes.
That's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown."""
7,The Drifters,Save the Last Dance For Me,1960,"You can dance
Every dance with the guy
Who gave you the eye

Who held your hand

Baby don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never never let you go
I love oh so much

You can dance (You can dance)
Go and carry on
'Till the night is gone
And it's time to go

If he asks
If you're all alone
Can he take you home
You must tell him no

'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So Darlin'
Save the last dance for me
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So Darlin'
Save the last dance for me
Mmmh'
Save the last dance for me

Save the last dance for me"

11,Elvis Presley,Stuck On You,1960,"You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake-a sugar but you'll never shake me
No-sir-ee

I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick because I'm stuck on you

I'm gonna run my fingers through your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Yes-sir-ee

I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm stuck on you

Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts
A team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart

Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Oh, yeah

I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm stuck on you

Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all

13,Jim Reeves,He'll Have to Go,1960,"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
...
Lets pretend we're together all alone
...

I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
...
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

...

Whisper to me tell me do you love me true
...

Or is he holding you the way I do
...

Though love is blind make up your mind I've got to know
...
Should I hang up or will you tell him he'll have to go
...
You cant say the words I want to hear
...
While you're with another man
Do you you want me answer yes or no
Darling I will understand
...
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
...
Lets pretend that we're together all alone
...
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
...
And you can tell your friend there with you
...
He'll have to go

14,Johnny Preston,Running Bear,1960,"On the bank of the river stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid
Little White Dove was her name, such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other, so their love could never be

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

He couldn't swim the raging river 'cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach the Little White Dove waiting on the other side
In the moonlight he could see her throwing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster waiting for her Indian brave

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

Running Bear dove in the water, Little White Dove did the same
And they swam out to each other through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met, the raging river pulled them down
Now they'll always be together in their happy hunting ground

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die"

16,The Shirelles,Will You Love Me Tomorrow,1960,"Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?

So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?"

A song of you

As moonlight through the pines

29,Brothers Four,Greenfields,1960,"Once there were greenfields
Kissed by the sun
Once there were valleys
Where rivers used to run
Once there were blue skies
With white clouds high above
Once they were part of
An everlasting love
We were the lovers who strolled
Through greenfields.

Greenfields are gone now
Parched by the sun
Gone from the valleys
Where rivers used to run
Gone with the cold wind
That swept in to my heart
Gone with the lovers
Who let their dreams depart
Where are the greenfields that we
Used to roam.

I'll never know what made you run away
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day
I only know there's nothing here for me
Nothing in this wild world left for me to see.

But I'll keep on waiting
'Til you return
I'll keep on waiting
Until the day you learn
You can't be happy
When your heart's on a roam
You can't be happy
Until you bring it home
Home to the greenfields and me
Once again."
30,Elvis Presley,A Mess of Blues,1960,"I just got your letter baby

I ain't slept a wink since Sunday
I can't eat a thing all day
Every day is just blue Monday
Since you've been away
Since you're gone I got a mess out of blues

Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace

I gotta get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train goin'
And leave my blues behind
Since you're gone I got a mess out of blues

Whoops there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face

You Know What They're Writing About

You know what they're writing about
Baby you know what they're writing about
It's a thing called love down through the ages
Makes you wanna cry sometimes
Makes you feel like you wanna lay down and die sometimes
Makes you high sometimes
But when you really get in it lifts you right up
Ain't it a wonderful game
Ain't it a marvellous game
And when there's no more words to say about love I go
Meet me down, meet me down,
Meet me down by the river
Meet me down by the water
Meet me down by the water
Meet me down by the pylons
Meet me down by the pylons
Meet me down by the pylons
Meet me down by the pylons
Meet me, meet me, I want you to meet me - are you there

Others earn a mint
My old man don't earn much
In fact he's flippin' skint

Oh, my old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat
He wears cor-blimey trousers
And he lives in a council flat

He looks a proper nana
In his great big hobnail boots
He's got such a job to pull them up
That he calls 'em daisy roots

Some folks give tips at Christmas
And some of them forget
So when he picks their bins up
He spills some on the step

Now one old man got nasty
And to the council wrote
Next time my old man went 'round there
He punched him up the throat

Oh my old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat
He wears cor-blimey trousers
And he lives in a council flat

Les: Well how do you do know he's a police dog?

Though my old man's a dustman
He's got an 'eart of gold
He got married recently
Though he's eighty-six years old

We said ""'Ere, hang on, Dad,
You're getting past your prime""
He said ""Well, when you get to my age
It helps to pass the time.""

Lonnie: My dustbin's full of lilies.
Les: Well throw 'em away then!
Lonnie: I can't: Lily's wearing them.

Now one day whilst in a hurry
He missed a lady's bin
He hadn't gone but a few yards
When she chased after him

""What game do you think you're playing?""
She cried right from the 'eart
""You've missed me, am I too late?""
""No, jump up on the cart!""

Lonnie: My dustbin's absolutely full with toadstools.
Les: How do you know it's full?
Lonnie: 'Cause there's not mushroom inside.

He found a tiger's head one day
Nailed to a piece of wood
The tiger looked like miserable
But I suppose he should

Just then from out a window
A voice began to wail
It said ""Oi! Where's me tiger's head?""
""Four foot from his tail.""

Oh my old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat

87,Mina,This World We Love In (Il Cielo In Una Stanza),1960,"Here in our little room
It's a dreamy world we love in.
Stars falling, flowers bloom
when we share this world we love in.
Walls seem to disappear
the room is filled with willows.
Heaven is, oh, so near
the blissy clouds of pillows.
High in the deep blue sky
with all our cares behind us
we'll watch the world go by
no one will ever find us
It's such a world apart
this dreamy world we love in.
Only the young at heart
can find this world we love in.
Just you and I, you and I
alone"
88,Fats Domino,My Girl Josephine,1960,"Hello Josephine
How do you do?
Do you remember me, baby?
Like I remember you
You used to laugh at me and holler
""Woo, woo, woo""

I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella
Every time it rained
You used to cry so much
It was a cryin' shame

You used to live over yonder
By the railroad track
When it rained you couldn't walk
I used to tote you on my back
Now you try to make believe
It was a thrill at that

Hello Josephine
How do you do?
Do you remember me, baby?

You used to laugh at me and holler

I wanna go home
Where I belong
Cause now I'm just a lonely teenager
When I was 16 ran away
All alone on a stray
What can I do what can I say
I'm a lonely teenager
Now I'm 17 still alone
Wondering if I should go home
Or maybe stay out on my own
I'm a lonely teenager
I'd love to go back home (back home)
Where I belong (back home)
I know I'd be alright
If I just stay out of sight
I wanna go home
Where I belong
Cause now I'm just a lonely teenager
(I wanna go back home
Just let me go back home)
I'd love to go back home (back home)

Stay with me, sway with me

Walking away from me.

Why did you make me cry?
Now everyday I wonder why, 
Why, why, oh why

You’re such a haunting memory
I pray that you’ll come back to me
But as I say my evening prayers
I hear your footsteps on the stairs
Walking away from me.

As transcribed from ""The Very Best of Jackie Wilson""

Night, here comes the night,
Another night to dream about you.
Night, each lonely night,
The only time I'm not without you.

Once more, I feel your kisses.
Once more, I know what bliss is.
Comes dawn, my darling, you're gone
But you come back into my arms each night.

Once more, I feel your kisses.
Once more, I know what bliss is.
Comes dawn, my darling, you're gone
But you come back into my arms each night.
