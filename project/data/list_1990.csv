1,Sinead O'Connor,Nothing Compares 2 U,1990,"It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl you better have fun
No matter what you do
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you"

3,Londonbeat,I've Been Thinking About You,1990,"We must have been stone crazy
When we thought we were just friends
'Cause I miss you, baby
And I've got those feelings again
I guess I'm all confused about you
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow

Suddenly we're strangers
I watch you walking away
She was my one temptation
Oh, I did not want her to stay
Deep down, I'm still confused about you
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow

What good is being here without you?

Oh, baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you

4,Vanilla Ice,Ice Ice Baby,1990,"Yo, VIP, Let's kick it! 

Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Baby 
All right stop, Collaborate and listen 
Ice is back with my brand new invention 
Something grabs a hold of me tightly 
Then I flow like a harpoon daily and nightly 
Will it ever stop? Yo -- I don't know 
Turn off the lights and I'll glow 
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal 
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle. 

Dance, Bum rush the speaker that booms 
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom 
Deadly, when I play a dope melody 
Anything less than the best is a felony 
Love it or leave it, You better gain way 
You better hit bull's eye, The kid don't play 
If there was a problem, Yo, I'll solve it 
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it 

Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 

Now that the party is jumping 
With the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin' 
Quick to the point, to the point no faking 
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon 
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble 
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal 
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo 
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo 
Rollin' in my 5.0 
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow 
The girlies on standby, Waving just to say Hi 
Did you stop? No -- I just drove by 
Kept on pursuing to the next stop 
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block 
That block was dead 

Yo -- so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave. 
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis 
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis 
Jealous 'cause I'm out geting mine 
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine 
Reading for the chumps on the wall 
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of ""Eight Ball"" 
Gunshots ranged out like a bell 
I grabbed my nine -- All I heard were shells 
Falling on the concrete real fast 
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas 
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed 
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack 
Police on the scene, You know what I mean 
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends 
If there was a problem, You, I'll solve it 
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it 

Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet 
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it 
My town, that created all the bass sound 
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground 
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill 
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel 
Conducted and formed, This is a hell of a concept 
We make it hype and you want to step with this 
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja 
Cut like a razor blade so fast, Other DJs say, ""damn"" 
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram 
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose 
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice 
If there was a problem, Yo -- I'll solve it! 
Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it. 

Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla 

Yo man - Let's get out of here! Word to your mother! 

Ice Ice Baby Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold 
Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold"

My, my, my, my

Music hits me so hard
Makes me say ""Oh my Lord!""
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet
It feels good when you know you're down
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch
I told you homeboy, you can't touch this

Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know
You can't touch this
Look in my eyes man, you can't touch this
Yo let me bust the funky lyrics, you can't touch this
Fresh new kicks and pants

You got it like that now you know wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin'. Hold on
Pump a little bit and let them know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch
Yo I told you, you can't touch this

Why you standing there man, you can't touch this
Yo sound the bell school is in, sucker
You can't touch this
Give me a song or rhythm

Making no sweat that's what I'm giving 'em
So now they know
You talk about the Hammer when you're talking 'bout a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What it's gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Stop! Hammer time!
Go with the flow. It is said

If you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves run your fingers through your hair
This is it for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Now move slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
Bump bump bump

Yeah, you can't touch this
Look man, you can't touch this
You'll probably get hyped boy 'cause you know you can't, you can't touch this
Ring the bell school's back in, break it down!

Stop! Hammer time!
Every time you see me

That Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor
And I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever
Stop doing this?
With others makin' records
That just don't hit
I toured around the world
From London to The Bay
It's ""Hammer. Go Hammer. MC Hammer. Yo Hammer!""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Too hype. Can't touch this
Yo get me outta here, you can't touch this

6,Roxette,It Must Have Been Love,1990,"It must have been love but it's over now
Lay a whisper on my pillow

Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away
It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow

It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside, I turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away
It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without

It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out
Yeah, it must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been love but it's over now"
7,Bon Jovi,Blaze of Glory,1990,"I wake up in the morning

I've got an old coat for a pillow
And the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm going
Only God knows where
I've been I'm a devil on the road
A six gun lover
A candle in the wind

When you're brought into this world
They say you're born in sin
Well at least they gave me something
I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well they tell me that I'm wanted
Yeah I'm a wanted man
I'm colt in your stable
I'm what Cain was to Abel

Mister catch me if you can

I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood

I'm no ones son
Call me young gun

You ask about my conscience
And I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man
Well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I known love

And what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come
And I've seen it shot down

I've seen it die in vain
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going down in a blaze of glory

Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son
Call me young gun

Each night I go to bed
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No I ain't looking for forgiveness
But before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I got to ask a favor
And I'll hope You'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest
Let this boy die like a man
Staring down the bullet
Let me make my final stand
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm no one's son

 Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high

 White lightening, bound to drive you wild
 Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl

 The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
 Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me

It took so long still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights, felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own

Had to be strong, so I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized a dream
And I visualized the love that came to be
Feel so alive, I'm so thankful that I perceived
The answer that Heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
  (All that you did)
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me

Prayed through the nights so faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

On the permission of another

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless

And forgettable
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary

They can only do harm

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms

All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

14,Paula Abdul,Opposites Attract,1990,"I'm M.C. Kat on the rap so mic it
Here's a little story and you're sure to like it
Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool
With my home girl, Paula Abdul

Baby seems we never ever agree
You like the movies and I like TV
I take things serious and you take 'em light
I go to bed early and I party all night

Our friends are sayin' we ain't gonna last
'Cuz I move slowly and baby I'm fast
I like it quiet and I love to shout
But when we get together, it just all works out

I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact
We come together 'cuz opposites attract

Who'd a thought we could be lovers
She makes the bed and he steals the covers
She likes it neat and he makes a mess
I take it easy baby, I get obsessed

She's got the money and he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes, I like to smoke
Things in common, there just ain't a one
But when we get together, we have nothin' but fun

I take two steps forward, two steps back
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
You know it baby, baby

Nothing in common but this trust
I'm like a minus, she's like a plus
One going up, one coming down
But we seem to land on common ground
When things go wrong we make corrections
To keep things moving in the right direction
Try to fight it but I'm telling you Jack
It's useless, opposites attract

Baby ain't it somethin' how we lasted this long
You and me provin' everyone wrong
Don't think we'll ever get our differences patched
Don't really matter 'cuz we're perfectly matched

I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact

15,Heart,All I Wanna Do is Make Love to You,1990,"It was a rainy night when he came into sight
Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat
So I pulled up alongside and I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile, so we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right, is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong just stay for the night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

So we found this hotel, It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night, oh he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me so many times, easily
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note

I told him, ""I am the flower you are the seed
We walked in the garden, we planted a tree
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

We made love, love like strangers
All night long we made love

Then it happened one day we came round the same way
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes
I said, ""Please, please understand, I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me was the one little thing that you can""

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will baby, you want me too
All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew, yeah"
16,DNA & ,Tom's Diner,1990,"[Feat. Suzanne Vega]

I am sitting in the morning
At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee

And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in

""It is always nice to see you""
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella

And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
I'm pretending not to see them
And instead I pour the milk

I open up the paper
There's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of

And I'm turning to the horoscope
And looking for the funnies
When I'm feeling someone watching me
And so I raise my head

There's a woman on the outside
Looking inside 
Does she see me?
No she does not really see me
Cause she sees her own reflection

And I'm trying not to notice
That she's hitching up her skirt
And while she's straightening her stockings
Her hair is getting wet

Oh, this rain it will continue
Through the morning as I'm listening
To the bells of the cathedral
I am thinking of your voice..."

These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now, these are the days
Of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much but we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time, oh yeah

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat
You wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there
Is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

And you cling to the things they sold you
Didn't you cover your eyes when they told you?
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time, oh yeah"

I took the knife as well posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell but when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing
Your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes

You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free

Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me

Release me, will you release me?
Ahh, release me
Release me, will you release me?"
29,Phil Collins,I Wish it Would Rain Down,1990,"You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend, yea
All this time I stayed out of sight
I started wondering why

Now I, ooh, now I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh, yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh, yes I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh, yes I wish it would rain on me

You said you didn't need me in your life
Oh I guess you were right, yeah
Ooh I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again, yeah

Now I, now I know, I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh, yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh girl, I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh, yes I wish it would rain on me

Though your hurt is gone
Mine's hanging on inside
And I know it's eating me through, it's eating me through
Every night and day, I'm just waiting on your sign

'Cause I know, I know, I never meant to cause you no pain
And I realize I let you down, oh yeah
But I know in my heart of heart of hearts
I know I'm never gonna hold you again, no

Now I, now I know, I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ohh, I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh, I wish it would rain down, down on me
Yes you know I wish it would rain down, rain down over me

Just rain down over me, just let it rain down

30,Elton John,Sacrifice,1990,"It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong

Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes calling
And negativity lands

Cold cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better baby
Just passing through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

Mutual misunderstanding
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act

We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate world
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate world
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all

No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all"
31,Bette Midler,From a Distance,1990,"From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man

God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance

From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for

From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man
(Every man)

It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
This is the song of every man

And God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
Oh, God is watching us, God is watching
God is watching us from a distance"
32,Snap,Ooops Up,1990,"This is a song about those bad days
Start up happy and end up sad days
Talking about that Murphy's law chill
If it can go wrong, yes it will

Went to the store to cop some groceries
Friday night and I had the munchies
Filled the cart till it could not take it
One more bag of chips would break it

Went to the cheek out stood in line
Behind me a girl who was just too fine
Got in the ear while they rang the total
Reached for my wallet uh oh a bolo

Not my day I felt like a dummy
Went to the store and forgot the money

Oops up inside your head
Oops up inside your head
Say oops up

Me and amy under the covers
Scene is hot potential lovers
Demon in the sack is her reputation
In school then she is graduation

Touching holding heavy breathing
I knew I'd get it she is not about teasing
Left on the light so I could see reaction
Amy is a freak guaranteed satisfaction

She is soft as bubble bath
I am as hard as chinese math
Ready for the ultimate affection
Took out a pack obtain my protection

Rolled it on one hard stroke
It was my last and yes it broke

Oops up inside your head
Oops up inside your head
Say oops up"
33,Glenn Medeiros & ,She Ain't Worth It,1990,"Better make tracks fast on the doubles
The girl's jazzy but she's nothin' but trouble

You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind

But she just cops an attitude
Leads you on then leaves you blue
Can't you see she's really just a waste of time?

One day she'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think your love will win her
In the end, think again

She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through
She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know, I know better than
Better than, better than, bet-better than you

Gets you hot then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
'Cause she knows you'll always give her one more try

You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playin' to the crowd
But tell me do you really like standin' in line

You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through
She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know, I know better than
Better than, better than, bet-better than you

I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie, that would be a lie
'Cause there's no one in this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied, I know 'cause I tried

Jump in, one thing I hate is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
'Cause I've tried to make you mine for the last time
So take this here as a dis and a goodbye

She ain't worth it even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip, and get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry 'cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy but she's nothin' but trouble

Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through
She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know, I know better than
Better than, better than, bet-better than you

34,Roxette,Dangerous,1990,"Oh, just a little bit dangerous

You pack your bag, you take control
You're moving into my heart and into my soul
Get out of my way, get out of my sight
I won't be walking on thin ice to get through the night

Hey, where's your work? What's your game?
I know your business but I don't know your name

Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous

You turn around, so hot and dry
You're hiding under a halo, your mouth is alive
Get out of my way, get out of my sight
I'm not attracted to go-go deeper tonight

Hey, what's your word? What's your game?
I know your business but I don't know your name

Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous

Never around to love me, you're always gone
'Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules
Oh, the man has come looking for you

You're a rebel now, don't give a damn
Always carrying on with the gang
I'm trying to tell you, boy, it's a mistake
You won't realize 'til it's too late

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

You're so together, boy but just at a glance
You'll do anything if given a chance
Scheming, planning lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep

Don't you tell yourself that it's okay
Sick and tired of all of your games
And you want me to stay, ah, better change
Makes no sense to me, your crazy ways

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Not afraid to die

Black cat, black cat
Man, I don't understand your ways
Living on the edge

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around, feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

Love takes time
To heal then you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go

I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

Losing my mind from this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

Love takes time
To heal then you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go

I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me but I know
That you do and I feel that you do inside

Love takes time
To heal then you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I, I was blind
To let you go

I can't escape the pain inside

I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there alone

It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it so sweet
But it makes no difference cuz it knocks you off your feet
You want it all but you can't have it
It's cryin', bleedin', lying on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it
You want it all but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it
It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magit, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win

I know your stairs and your doorway

I stand by the light of the four way
and watch them as they fall, oh baby

They stay at the carnival

Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

You can cheat the devil and slice a piece of the sun
Burn up the highway but before you run
You gotta love someone

You let someone share the heat
When you're on your own and there's no one there

and invitations to teenage parties
'Dress in white' one said with quotations
from someone's wife, a famous writer
in the nineteen-twenties
When you're young you find inspiration
in anyone who's ever gone
and opened up a closing door
She said we were never feeling bored

'cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
and we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought then thought make amends
And we were never holding back or worried that
time would come to an end

When I went I left from the station
with a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said if you're not careful
you'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
in the nineteen-seventies
But I sat back and looking forward
my shoes were high and I had scored
I'd bolted through a closing door
and I would never find myself feeling bored

'cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
and we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought then thought make amends
And we were never holding back or worried that
time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
you could always rely on a friend

Now I sit with different faces
in rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
some are here and some are missing
in the nineteen-nineties
I never dreamt that I would get to be
the creature that I always meant to be
but I thought in spite of dreams
you'd be sitting somewhere here with me

'cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
and we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought then thought make amends
And we were never holding back or worried that
time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
you could always rely on a friend

So through the darkness show me who you are

So through the darkness show me who you are

I have a picture, a thought in mind
Now it's time to realize
This is something you should analyze
In your mind

Are you dreaming wishing on a star?
A dream's a dream and so a star
So through the darkness
Show me who you are
Are you dreaming wishing on a star
A dream's a dream and so a star
So through the darkness
Show me who you are

Now as I see the things in front of me
Open my arms and welcome you
Hoping that his dream will come true
So many rivers to cross
Somehow you could get lost
But by the time I'm through
I can see right through you

I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
I can see right through you

But you'll lose just the same

There's an empty space

there is one thing I know: I've still got the blues for you"

the image and the style that ya used to.
I look funny,
but yo I'm makin' money, see
so yo world I hope you're ready for me.
Now gather round
I'm the new fool in town
and my sound's laid down by the Underground.
I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf
so just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty.
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee.
And all the rappers in the top ten-please allow me to bump thee.
I'm steppin' tall, y'all,
and just like Humpty Dumpty
you're gonna fall when the stereos pump me.
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky,
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy.
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
but sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
hey yo fat girl, c'mere-are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat.
Look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak
I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy.
Allow me to amaze thee.
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me.
I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants
and I even got my own dance

come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump

Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
that's all right 'cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
but ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B,
all the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere
'cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear.
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge,
both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stoopid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid,
I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it,
I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write.

All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
and now I'm gonna do my dance.

Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here

Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain

Humpin', funkin', jumpin',
jig around, shakin' ya rump,
and when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump
tell him step off, I'm doin' the Hump.

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doin' the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world,
keep on doin' the Humpty Dance,
and to the ladies,
peace and humptiness forever"

90,Poison,Something to Believe In,1990,"Well I see him on the TV
Preaching about the promised lands
he tells me believe in Jesus
steals the money from my hands
some say he was a good man
Lord I think he sinned... yeah

Twenty two years of mental tears
cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war
on a foreign shore
to find his country didn't want him back
their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
our lawyers took his wife and kids no regrets
In a time I don't remember
in a war he can't forget
he cried ""forgive me for what I done there
Cause I never meant the things I did""

and give me something to believe in
if there's a lord above
and give me something to believe in

oh, lord arise
My best friend died a lonely man
in some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
and they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down n cry
as the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
like a lost soul out of place
and the Mirror mirror on the wall

sees my smile it fades again
and give me something to believe in (I give me something to believe in)
if there's lord above

and give me something to believe in (I give me something to believe in)
Oh, lord arise
Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now

things I didn't know then

Road you gotta take me home
Solo
I drive by the homeless
sleepin' on a cold dark street
like bodies in an old bone grave
underneath the broken old neon sign
used to read ""Jesus saves""
A mile away live the rich folk
and I see how they're livin' it up
but while the poor they eat from hand to mouth
the rich are drinkin' from a golden cup

and it just makes me wonder
why so many lose and so few win... Ha!
Give me something to believe in
give me something to believe in
If there's a lord above
give me something to believe in
oh lord arise
give me something to believe in
you take the high road
give me something to believe in
and I'll take the low road
give me something to believe in

91,Sweet Sensation,If Wishes Came True,1990,"All alone silence fills my room
But in a memory I hear you calling me
Close my eyes and I'm there with you
Like it was yesterday but then it fades away

Take me back, turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
(Warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled the pain
If only we could be in love that way again

If whishes came true and all the dreams at night
Of love were real, Id be holding you
If whishes came true

Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
We would be still be lovers, not apart
If whishes came true

Now yourè gone and Im on my own
Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye
In my dreams I still feel your touch
Lying next to me feeling esctacy

Take me back turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
(Warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again

92,The Cure,Pictures of You,1990,"I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

Remembering you, standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in,  holding you close
How I always held close in your fear

Remembering you, running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and whiter than snow
And screamed at the make believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

Remembering you, fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white, so delicate,  lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time, then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything

If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
My pictures of you"
93,Gloria Estefan,Here We Are,1990,"Here we are, face to face
We forget, time and place
Hold me now, don't let go
Though it hurts and we both know

The time we spend together's gonna fly
And everything you do to me is gonna feel so right
Baby when you're loving me I feel like I could cry
'Cause there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you
No, no, no

Here we are, all alone
Trembling hearts, beating strong
Reaching out, breathless kiss
I never thought could feel like this

I want to stop the time from passing by
Wanna close my eyes and feel your lips are touching mine
Baby when you're close to me I want you more each time
And there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you

There's nothing I can do, I'm helpless in your arms
Baby what you do, I'm in love, this is it
There's no turning back this time
No, no, no

Here we are, once again
But this time we're only friends
Funny world, sometimes lies
Become the game, when love's the prize

And though no one knows what's going on inside
And all the love I feel for you is something I should hide
When I have you close to me, the feeling's so sublime
That there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you
No, no, no, can't keep from loving you, baby
No, no, no

There's nothing I can do, my baby
Can't keep from loving you"

97,Skid Row,I Remember You,1990,"Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through

I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew that you were there for me
Time after time, you were there for me

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you

We spent the summer with the top rolled down
Wished ever after would be like this
You said ""I love you babe,"" without a sound
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile, and die for your kiss

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you

We've had our share of hard times
But that's the price we paid
And through it all, we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
Washed away a dream of you
But nothing else could ever take you away
'Cause you'll always be my dream come true

Oh my darling, I love you!
Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you
