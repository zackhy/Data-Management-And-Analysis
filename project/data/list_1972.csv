1,Don McLean,American Pie,1972,"A long, long time ago, I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried, when I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside the day the music died

So bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lenin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang 'Dirges In The Dark'
The day the music died

We were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
Landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singing bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing, bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die"
2,Harry Nilsson,Without You,1972,"No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give any more
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give any more

No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore"
3,Hot Butter,Popcorn,1972,Instrumental
4,Neil Young,Heart of Gold,1972,"I want to live
I want to give
I've been a miner
for a heart of gold
It's these expressions
I never give
That keep me searching
for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I've crossed the ocean
for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
it's such a fine line
That keeps me searching
for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
for a heart of gold

And I'm getting old

Keep me searching
for a heart of gold
You keep me searching
And I'm growing old
Keep me searching
for a heart of gold
I've been a miner
for a heart of gold"
5,Roberta Flack,The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,1972,"The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless skies, my love
To the dark and the endless skies

And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command, my love

And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love
And it will last till the end of time, my love

The first time ever I saw your face, your face
Your face, your face"
6,Al Green,Let's Stay Together,1972,"I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is all right with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Let me say that since, alright, since we've been together
Loving you forever is what I need
Oh let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Oh let's, let's stay together
Lovin' you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad, alright, oh yeah
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Oh tell me why, why, why, why, why, why
Why people break up, turn around and make up
I can't see, you never, never, never do that to me
You better not do, staying around you is all I
All these eyes will ever see

Why won't you say that me, everybody says
That let's, let's stay together
Lovin' you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

7,Daniel Boone,Beautiful Sunday,1972,"Sunday morning, up with the lark
I think I'll take a walk in the park
Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day

I've got someone, waiting for me
When I see her, I know that she'll say

8,Gilbert O'Sullivan,Alone Again (Naturally),1972,"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top, will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear
To who ever what it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church

Where people saying, ""My God, that's tough
She's stood him up no point in us remaining
We may as well go home""
As I did on my own alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to well who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play

But as if to knock me down reality came around
And without so much, as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces leaving me to doubt

Talk about God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did he desert me in my hour of need
I truly am indeed, alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?

Alone again, naturally
Now looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died

Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken

Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken and when she passed away
I cried and cried all day, alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally"
9,Gilbert O'Sullivan,Clair,1972,"Clair, the moment I met you
I swear I felt as if something
Somewhere had happened to me
Which I couldn't see

And then the moment I met you again
I knew in my heart that we were friends
It had to be so it couldn't be no
But try as hard as I might do

I don't know why you get to me
In a way I can't describe
Words mean so little
When you look up and smile

I don't care what people say to me
You're more than a child, oh Clair
Clair

Clair, if ever a moment so rare
Was captured for all to compare
That moment is you in all that you do
But why in spite of our age difference
Do I cry each time I leave you

I feel I could die
Nothing means more to me
Than hearing you say
â€½I'm going to marry you
Will you marry me, Uncle Ray?""
Oh Clair, Clair

Clair I've told you before don't you dare
Get back into bed can't you see that is late
No you can't have a drink
Oh alright then, but wait just a bit

While I in an effort to baby sit
Capture my breath what there is left of it
You can be murder at this hour of the day
But in the morning tonight will seem a life time away
Oh Clair, Clair"
10,America,Horse With No Name,1972,"On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Cause there ain't no one 4-2 give you no pain
La, la
After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la
After nine days I let the horse run free
Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la"
11,Neil Diamond,Song Sung Blue,1972,"Song Sung Blue

Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song
You sing them out again

Weeping like a willow

Sleeping on my pillow

Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice

12,Melanie,Brand New Key,1972,"I rode my bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at daylight
It almost seems like you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you got something I need

Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

I asked your mother if you were at home
She said yes, but you weren't alone

14,Donny Osmond,Puppy Love,1972,"And they called it puppy love
Oh, I guess they'll never know
How a young heart really feels
And why I love her so

And they called it puppy love
Just because we're in our teens
Tell them all, please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream

I cry each night my tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I'll hope and I'll pray that maybe someday
You'll be back in my arms once again

Someone help me, help me, help me please
Is the answer up above
How can I, how can I tell them?
This is not a puppy love

Amazing Grace
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found.
'Twas blind, but now I see.
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Then when we first begun.
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found.
Was blind, but now I see."

And she works laying whiskey down
They say, ""Brandy, fetch another round""
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl""
What a good wife you would be
Yeah your eyes could steal
A sailor from the sea""

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the North of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of the man that Brandy loves

He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

The sailor said, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl
What a good wife you would be
But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea""

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean foam rise
She saw its raging glory

But he had always told the truth
Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

At night when the bar's close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

Paint your pallet blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free

They would not listen
They did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning field of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist’s loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free

They would not listen
They did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now


For they could not love you
But still your love was true

And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life as lovers often do

But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant
For one as beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free

They would not listen
They're not listening still
Perhaps they never will"

Praise for them springing fresh from the word

Sweet the rain's new fall sunlit from heaven
Like the first dewfall on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where His feet pass

Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning
Born of the one light, Eden saw play
Praise with elation, praise every morning
God's recreation of the new day

So I left my home I'm really on my own at last
Left the trodden path and separated from the past

There was magic in the air

Wearing his disguise

She belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk

When the only people that existed were troglodytes... cave men...
cave women... Neanderthal... troglodytes. Let's take the average
cave man at home, listening to his stereo. Sometimes he'd get up,
try to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this:
""Dance... dance"". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look
in the mirror: ""Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a
woman gotta find a woman"". He'd go down to the lake where all the
woman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look
around and just reach in and grab one. ""Come here... come here"".
He'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause
it might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd
be swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there,
wet and frightened. He said: ""Move... move"". She got up. She was a
big woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one
of the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said:
""Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me
sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!"". She looked down on him.
She was ready to crush him, but she began to like him. She said
(falsetto):
""I'll sock it to ya, Daddy"". He said: ""Wha?"". She said (falsetto):
""I'll sock it to ya, Daddy"". You know what he said? He started it way
back then. I wouldn't lie to you. When she said (falsetto)

I was feeling something wasn't right
There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you

So we walked along
Though I knew there was something wrong
And the feeling hit me, oh, so strong
About you

Then you gazed up at me
And the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light in your eyes
In your eyes

Though we had our fling
I just never would suspect a thing
Till that little bell began to ring in my head
In my head, in my head

But I tried to run
Though I knew it wouldn't help me none
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one
Or so I said

But my feelings for you
Were just something I never knew
Till I saw the light in your eyes
In your eyes

But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different girl from all the rest
In my eyes

And I ran out before
But I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light in my eyes
In my eyes, in my eyes, in my eyes"

4-Tay: Yo, wassup?
Fly: Wassup, Fo? I know you finished that cut for the radio
4-Tay: As a matter of fact Fly I just finished it baby boy, no worry about nothin', I'll be around

Regardless if I'm chillin' backstage or on tour
With my homie Young Fly even I'll be sure
Never hesitate to call me after I'm done
Cause homie I'm real and always true to my loved ones
Too many wakes and funerals full of tears
You say there's something on your mind, well hey, I'm all ears
Cause ain't nobody thinking about the funk that you're choosin' it
A lot of my homies stuck in the pen for life or losin' it
Call up your folks you keep thinkin' about home
Recorder keeps a peep and there's a block on the phone
And all of this is enough to make a brother's nerves bad
Reminds me of a situation that I once had
Spent that, spent this endless relentless tremendous women on my jock
And don't nobody mind their business
He say she say throwin' salt about it
And chooses to talk about you cause there's no one else to talk about
Talk about the show and the flow and all the clout
Then be real with yourself and talk about and turned it out
It's not hard to compete when his name is poppin'
A scared man can never win that's why I stay clockin'
Fools be huffin' and puffin' don't wanna see me about nothin' I'm down

Whenever you call me: I'll be there
Whenever you want me: I'll be there
Whenever you need me: I'll be there

Life ain't based on peaches and cream
This new generation lost a whole lot of dreams
Future doctors, producers, and mothers
The list goes on but now we killin' our brothers
And if we killin' our brothers that means we killin' our own kind
These kids is watchin' now it goes to their mind
Rat-tat-a-tat cause you got a gat
Then they want a gat you livin' like that?
Moms ain't cookin' she worked the week straight
If anything she's the one deserves a hot plate
The ghetto, the ghetto ain't nothin' to dream about
Tryin' to get out now that's somethin' to think about
Fools might disagree but I'm a stay sucka free
Now I'm so black and so strong they can't fade me
Blacks are blacks worst enemy there's still no remedy
You got me for a grip do you call yourself kin of me?
Jealousy, envy, I see it in your eyes
Tell me what's wrong with seeing a black man rise
I keep it funky it's pretty hard to miss it now it is not explicit
A message for the mind, and a moral for statistics
So I'm doin' what we call a roll call
Talkin' about the ones who won't rap then take a downfall
I spit the street life and then I go underground
You silly, it's called versatility and I'll be around

Things are gettin' crucial you gotta exercise your mind
Or learn about life before you're left behind
But how you gonna get it right when you're not doin' right
When you get mad all you want is a gunfight
This tension causes a gang of madness
Now you want funk that results to sadness
Sadness results to a lot of revenge
And your so called friends really ain't your friends
So how do you know who you're able to trust
If you think about the past look what happened to us
I never trust no one, I only trust myself
Or I would've been a victim like everyone else
In friendship or hardship whenever you need me
Just give me a call G I won't deceive thee
These fools be shakin' best believe they're fakin'
Just tryin' to get a grip of all the money you're makin'
This ain't race a mind is a terrible thing to waste
I drop the rap and J drops the bass
To the flow cause ain't nobody get with Fo
I'm a down young brother comin' straight outta Frisco
Droppin' a message out of love to your town
Love your brothers and sisters and I'll be around"

You don't know how many times
I wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could mold you into someone
Who could cherish me as much as I cherish you

Perish is the word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not going to be the one
To share your dreams
That I am not going to be the one
To share your schemes
That I am not going to be the one
To share what seems to be the life
That you could cherish me as much as I do yours

Oh, I'm beginning to think
That man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters
Just the right sound
That could make you hear
Make you see
That you're driving me out of my mind

Oh I could say I need you
But then you'd realize that I want you
Just like a thousand other guys
Who say they'd love you
With all the rest of their lives
When all they wanted was to
Touch your face, your hands
And gaze into your eyes

Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times
I wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times
I wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times
I wished that I could mold you into someone
That could cherish me as much as I cherish you

And I do
Cherish you
And I do
I cherish you
Yes I do
I cherish you"
87,The New Seekers,Beg Steal Or Borrow,1972,"You know I'll beg steal or borrow
I bring you love
I look at you and I see what I've been looking for
Now it's very clear to me we should be together
You make me feel I could reach for the impossible
And knowing how much you care, I'll be there forever

You know I'll beg, steal or borrow to give you sunny days
And in a hundred ways I'll bring you love
You know I beg steal or borrow

And most of all you know, I bring you love love love
I always knew that the world would be a finer place

They can drink it

With the money he takes
He might be very rich one day

back off Boogaloo

back off Boogaloo
Boo.

What d'yer think you're gonna do
I gotta flash right from the start.
Wake up meat head don't pretend that.
You are dead get yourself up off the cart.
Get yourself together now
and give me something tasty.
Evrything you try to do
you it shure sound wasted.

Back off Boogaloo
I said
back off Boogaloo.
You think you're groove
standing there in your wallpaper shoes
and your socks that match your eyes.

Back off Boogaloo
I said
back off Boogaloo.
Come on
back off Boogaloo."
91,Cornelius Brothers & Sister Rose,Too Late To Turn Back Now,1972,"My mama told me
She said, ""Son, please beware
There's this thing called love
And it's everywhere""

She told me, ""It can break your heart
And put you in misery""
Since I met this little woman
I feel it's happened to me
And I'm tellin' you

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love

I found myself wantin' her
At least ten times a day
You know, it's so unusual for me
To carry on this way

I'm tellin' you, I can't sleep at night
Wantin' to hold her tight
I've tried so hard to convince myself
That this feelin' just can't be right
And I'm tellin' you

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe I believe, I'm fallin' in love

It's too late to turn back now oh, baby
I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love
It's too late, baby to turn back now I tell ya
I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love

I wouldn't mind it
If I knew she really loved me too
But I hate to think that I'm in love alone
And nothing that I can do

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love
It's too late, baby to turn back now I tell ya
I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love
It's too late to turn back now

92,Rod Stewart,You Wear it Well,1972,"I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
But to settle down and write you a line
I've been meaning to phone you, but from Minnesota
Hell it's been a very long time

You wear it well
A little old fashioned but that's all right

Well, I suppose you're thinking I bet he's sinking
Or he wouldn't get in touch with me
Oh, I ain't begging or losing my head
I sure do want you to know

That you wear it well
There ain't a lady in the land so fine, oh my

Remember them basement parties, your brother's karate
The all day rock 'n' roll shows
Their homesick blues and the radical views
Haven't left a mark on you

You wear it well
A little out of time but I don't mind

But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out
Tryin' to get a letter through

Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it didn't cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire

And you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you, no, no

Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told
That I gotta get back to work
So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone
Think of me and try not to laugh

And I wear it well
I don't object if you call Collect

'Cos I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out
Tryin' to get back to you

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Oh, yeah

After all the years I hope it's the same address
Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on, oh no, oh no"
93,Main Ingredient,Everybody Plays the Fool,1972,"Everybody plays the fool sometime
There's no exception to the rule
Listen, baby, it may be factual, may be cruel
I ain't lying, everybody plays the fool
Falling in love is such an easy thing to do
And there's no guarantee that the one you love is gonna love you
Oh, lovin' eyes they cannot see a certain person could never be
Love runs deeper than any ocean
You can cloud your mind with emotion
Everybody plays the fool, sometime
They use your heart like a tool
Listen, baby, they never tell you so in school
But everybody plays the fool
How can you help it when the music starts to play
And your ability to reason is swept away
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see
You're out of touch with reality
Now you cry but when you're through
The next time someone cries for you"

When I grow up, I'm gonna make it mine

Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's askin'
Workin' starts to make me wonder where
Fruits of what I do are goin'
When he says in love and war all is fair
He's got cards he ain't showin'

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost

When I came to be
So we grew up together
My mama child and me
Now things were bad and she was scared
But whenever I would cry
She'd calm my fears and dry my tears
With a rock and roll lullaby

And she'd sing sha na na na na na na na na
It'll be all right
Sha na na na na na na na na na
Just hold on tight
Sing it to me mama, mama mama mama
Sing it sweet and clear
Oh, mama let me hear that old rock and roll lullaby

Now, we made it through the lonely days
But Lord the nights were long
And we'd dream of better moments
When mama sang her song
Now I can't recall the words at all
It don't make sense to try
'Cause I just knew lots of love came through
In that rock and roll lullaby

And she'd sing sha na na na na na na na na
It'll be all right
Sha na na na na na na na na na
Just hold on tight
I can hear you mama, mama mama mama
Nothing moves my soul
Like the sound of a good old rock and roll lullaby

It'll be alright
Just hold on tight
Mama, mama, mama
Nothing moves my soul
Like the sound of a good old rock and roll lullaby
It'll be alright
Just hold on tight
Sing it sweet and clear"
