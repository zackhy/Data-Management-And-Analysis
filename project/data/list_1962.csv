1,Ray Charles,I Can't Stop Loving You,1962,"I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
(I can't stop wanting you)

It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterday
(Dreams of yesterday)
Those happy hours that we once knew

Tho' long ago, they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart
(I can't stop loving you)

I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
(I can't stop wanting you)

It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterday
(Those happy hours)
Those happy hours

(That we once knew)
That we once knew
(Tho' long ago)

Tho' long ago
(Still make me blue)
Still make me blue
(They say that time)

They say that time
(Heals a broken heart)
Heals a broken heart
(But time has stood still)

Time has stood still
(Since we've been apart)
Since we've been apart
(I can't stop loving you)
I said I made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
Sing the song, children
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterday
(Of yesterday)"
2,Pat Boone,Speedy Gonzales,1962,"It was a moonlit night in Old Mexico.
I walked alone between some old adobe haciendas.
Suddenly, I heard the plaintive cry of a young Mexican girl:

La la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la
la la la la.

You better come home Speedy Gonzales, away from tannery row.
Stop all of your drinking with that floosie named Flo!
Come on home to your adobe and slap some mud on the wall!
The roof is leaking like a strainer. There's loads of roaches in the
hall.
(La la la la)

Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales),
why don't you come home?
Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales),
how come you leave me all alone?

""He, Rosita, I have to go shopping downtown for my mother,
she needs some Tortillias and Chilli Pepper!""

La, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la
la la.

Your doggie's gonna have a puppy, and we're running out of Coke.
no enchiladas in the icebox, and the television's broke.
I saw some lipstick on your sweatshirt, I smell some perfume in your
ear.
Well, if you're gonna keep on messin', don't bring your business back
a-here.
(La la la la)

Mmm, Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales),
why don't you come home?
Speedy Gonzales (Speedy Gonzales),
how come you leave me all alone?

""He, Rosita, come quick!
Down at the cantina, they're giving green stamps with Tequila!""

La, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la
la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la
la la la la la."

Return to sender

I gave a letter to the postman
He put it in his sack
Bright in early next morning
He brought my letter back

She wrote upon it
Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone

We had a quarrel, a lover's spat
I write I'm sorry
But my letter keeps coming back

So when I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent a special D
Bright in early next morning
It came right back to me

She wrote upon it
Return to sender, address unknown
No such person, no such zone

5,Elvis Presley,Can't Help Falling in Love,1962,"Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

6,Elvis Presley,Good Luck Charm,1962,"Don't want a four leaf clover
Don't want an old horse shoe
Want your kiss 'cause I just can't miss
With a good luck charm like you

Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm
a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight

Don't want a silver dollar
Rabbit's foot on a string
The happiness in your warm caress
No rabbit's foot can bring

Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm
a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight

If I found a lucky penny
I'd toss it across the bay
Your love is worth all the gold on earth
No wonder that I say

Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm
a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight"
7,Little Eva,The Loco-Motion,1962,"Everybody is doin' a brand new dance, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now

Come on, baby
Jump up, jump back

A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion

10,Bobby Vinton,Roses Are Red,1962,"Roses are red, my love ... doo doo da doooo ...

A long, long time ago, on graduation day.
You handed me your book ... I signed this way:

""Roses are red, My Love,
Violets are blue,
Sugar is sweet, My Love,
But not as sweet as you.""

We dated through high school,
And when the big day came,
I wrote into your book,
next to my name:

""Roses are red, My Love,
Violets are blue,
Sugar is sweet, My Love,
But not as sweet as you.""

Then I went far away, and you found someone new.
I read your letter, Dear, and I wrote back to you:

""Roses are red, My Love,
Violets are blue,
Sugar is sweet, My Love,
Good luck, may God bless you.""

Is that your little girl?
She looks a lot like you.
Someday some boy will write
in her book, too.

""Roses are red, My Love,
Violets are blue,
Sugar is sweet, My Love,
But not as sweet as you."""

She's all the things a girl should be but she's not you
She knows just how to make me laugh when I feel blue
She's everything a man could want but she's not you

And when we're dancing it almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from whispering your name
She even kisses me like you used to do
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you
And it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you

And when we're dancing it almost feels the same

57,Connie Francis,Don't Break the Heart That Loves You,1962,"Don't break the heart that loves you;
Handle it with care
Don't break the heart that needs you;
Darling, please be fair
Why do you flirt, and constantly hurt me?
Why do you treat our love so carelessly?
You know I'm jealous of you,
And yet you seem to try
To go out of your way
To be unkind
Sweetheart, I'm begging of you,
Don't break this heart that loves you
Don't break this heart of mine
(Spoken) Darling, please don't hurt me;
Please, don't make me cry
I don't know what I'd do if you'd ever say goodbye
Remember -- I love you so much,
And love is life's greatest joy
Please don't break my heart like a child breaks a little toy
Sweetheart, I'm begging of you,
Don't break this heart that loves you
Don't break this heart of mine"
58,Freddy Cannon,Palisades Park,1962,"Last night I took a walk after dark
A swingin' place called palisades park
To have some fun and see what I could see
That's where the girls are

I took a ride on a shoot-the-chute
That girl I sat beside was awful cute
After we stopped she was holdin' hands with me
My heart was flyin'

Up like a rocket ship
Down like a roller coaster
Back like a loop-the-loop
And around like a merry-go-round

We ate and ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rockin' band
And when I could I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love

You'll never know how great a kiss can feel
When you stop at the top of a ferris wheel
When I fell in love down at palisades park"

Kiss me strong, kiss me long till the end of time
Kiss me warm and tender, dear

I'm in heaven in your embrace
See the glow of your angel face
Heaven sings, heaven rings, on your wings we will fly away
We will fly, you and I, to the sky where we'll always stay

Take my lips, take my arms, they belong to you
Love me warm and tender, dear

on a mountain in switzerland,
yo lo lo lo,
there lived a fair young maiden,
lovely but lonely,
oh oh oh oh.
Day after day,
she'd pine her heart away,
yo lo lo lady yay,
but no love came her way.
Some day papa said,
some day we'll go,
down to the village in the valley,
then you'll meet a nice young man,
ask for your hand,
then you'll be happy
Every day she grew unhappier,
on a mountain in switzerland,
yo lo lo lo,
every day a little bit lonelier,
which way to turn and which way to go
Day after day,
she'd pine her heart away,
yo lo lo lady yay,
but no love came her way.
Some say the maidens dream,
never came true,
she never got to go to the valley,
if she did or not,
i really don't know, oh oh oh oh.
did she die unhappy?
I'd rather think she found her love,
wouldn't she be better if she did find love?
somewhere,
some way.

86,The Shirelles,"Baby, It's You",1962,"It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears my apart
But how many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself
Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you
You should hear what they say about you (cheat, cheat)
They say, they say you never never ever been true (cheat, cheat)
Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you
Wo ho, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you
Don't leave me all alone"
87,Mary Wells,You Beat Me To The Punch,1962,"That day, I first saw you passing by
I wanted to know your name but I was much too shy

But I was looking at you so hard
Until you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me my name

You beat me to the punch that time
You beat me to the punch
You beat me to the punch

After I hadn't known you for it seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you, would you please, please be mine

Whenever you came around, my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours

You beat me to the punch one more time
You beat me to the punch
You beat me to the punch, yeah

Since I love you, I thought you would be true
And love me tender
So I let my heart surrender
To you, yes, I did

But I found out beyond a doubt one day, boy, you were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me blue

So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day

And beat you to the punch this time
And beat you to the punch this time
I'll beat you to the punch, yes, I will
And let you know, know, how it feels"

And every thing's gonna be fine""

I'm just abiding my time
'Cause the company and the daughter, you see
They both gonna be all mine

Yeah, I'm gonna be the man
Gonna be the man
Gotta make him a hand
If it gonna be the man

Where everyone's his boss and he's lost in an angry land

But then he comes uptown each evenin' to my tenement
Uptown where folks don't have to pay much rent

Let me down the easy way
Make me feel that you still love me
If it's just, if it's just for one more day
Break it to me gently
So my tears my tears won't fall too fast
If you must go, then go slowly
Let me love you 'till the last
The love we shared for oh so long
Is such a big part of me.
If you must take your love away
Take it gradually
Oh break it, break it to me gently
Give me time or give me a little time to ease the pain
Love me just a little longer
'Cause I never never love again.
'Cause I'll never love, never love again."

If you hear somebody knocking on your door
If you somebody crawlin’ across the floor
Baby it’ll be me
I’ll be lookin’ for you

Well if you see sombody climbin’ up a telegraph pole
If you find a new lump in your sugar bowl
Baby it’ll be me
I’ll be lookin’ for you

I’m gonna search in the mountain
Down in the deep blue sea
I’m gonna search the countryside
And look and look in every tree

If you find a new bait on your fishing hook
If you find a funny face in your comic book
Baby it’ll be me
I’ll be lookin’ for you

I’m gonna look in the city
Where the lights are blue
I’m gonna search in the forests
And the haystacks too

If you see a rocket ship on it’s way to Mars

98,Gene Pitney,(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance,1962,"When Liberty Valance rode to town
The women folk would hide, they'd hide
When Liberty Valance walked around
The men would step aside

Because the point of a gun
Was the only law that Liberty understood
When it came to shooting, straight and fast
He was mighty good

From out of the east a stranger came
A law book in his hand, a man
The kind of a man the West would need
To tame a troubled land

'Cause the point of a gun
Was the only law that Liberty understood
When it came to shooting, straight and fast
He was mighty good

Many a man would face his gun and many a man would fall
The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all

The love of a girl can make a man
Stay on when he should go, stay on
Just trying to build a peaceful life
Where love is free to grow

But the point of a gun
Was the only law that Liberty understood
When the final showdown came to pass
A law book was no good

Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd
Return that fateful night, ahh, that night
When nothing she said could keep
Her man from going out to fight

From the moment a girl gets to be full grown
The very first thing she learns
When two men go out to face each other
Only one returns

Everyone heard two shots ring out
The shot made Liberty fall
The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all

The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all"
