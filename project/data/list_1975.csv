1,Billy Swan,I Can Help,1975,"If you've got a problem, don't care what it is
If you need a hand, I can assure you this

I can help, I've got two strong arms, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help

It's a fact that people get lonely, ain't nothing new
But a woman like you, babe, should never have the blues

Let me help, I've got two for me, let me help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help

When I go to sleep at night, you're always a part of my dreams
Holding me tight and telling me everything I want to hear

Don't forget me, babe, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, I can do anything at all

Let me help if your child needs a Dad, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help

When I go to sleep at night, you're always a part of my dreams
Holding me tight and telling me everything I want to hear

Don't forget me, babe, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, if I can do anything at all

Let me help, for a child needs a Dad, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help"
2,Abba,SOS,1975,"Where are those happy days? They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love, I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me? SOS
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, SOS
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try how can I carry on?

You seemed so far away though you were standing near
You made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood
What happened to our love? It used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me? SOS
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, SOS
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try how can I carry on?

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me? SOS
And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me, SOS
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try how can I carry on?
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try how can I carry on?"
3,10CC,I'm Not in Love,1975,"I'm not in love, so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because, I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because

I like to see you but then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because

I keep your picture upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because

Ooh you wait a long time for me
Ooh you wait a long time
Ooh you wait a long time for me
Ooh you wait a long time

I'm not in love so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
Oh I'm not in love, I'm not in love

Una Paloma Blanca
When the sun shines on the mountain
And the night is on the run
It's a new day
It's a new way
And I fly up to the sun

I can feel the morning sunlight
I can smell the new-mown hay
I can hear God's voice is calling
For my golden sky light way

Una paloma blanca
I'm just a bird in the sky
Una paloma blanca
Over the mountains I fly
No one can take my freedom away

Once I had my share of losing
for they locked me on a chain
Yes they tried to break my power
oh I still can feel the pain

Over the mountains I fly
No one can take my freedom away

9,Glen Campbell,Rhinestone Cowboy,1975,"I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway

Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away
Like the snow and the rain

There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way

And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token
And a dollar tucked inside my shoe

There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know"
10,Rod Stewart,Sailing,1975,"I am sailing, I am sailing
Home again 'cross the sea
I am sailing, stormy waters
To be near you, to be free

I am flying, I am flying
Like a bird 'cross the sky
I am flying, passing high clouds
To be with you, to be free

Can you hear me, can you hear me
Through the dark night, far away?
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say

Can you hear me?

Can you hear me, can you hear me
Through the dark night far away?
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say, who can say

We are sailing, we are sailing
Home again 'cross the sea
We are sailing stormy waters
To be near you, to be free

Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free
Oh my Lord, to be near you, to be free
Oh my Lord, to be near you, to be free

12,Barry White,"You're the First, the Last, My Everything",1975,"My first, my last, my everything
And the answer to all my dreams
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are

I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
You're all I'm living for, your love I'll keep forevermore
First, you're the last, my everything

In you I've found so many things
A love so new, only you could bring
Can't you see it's you? You make me feel this way
You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day

I see so many ways that I can love you 'til the day I die
You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, the last, my everything

I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
Girl, you're my reality, but I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, you're the last, my everything"

No, no, no, I
I never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core

It says, ""Turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more""
Tell me why is it so?
Don't wanna let you go!

Hey, I never can say goodbye boy, ooh baby
I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, hey

I never can say goodbye
Oh, no, I
I never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt

It's that same old dizzy hang-up
I can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so?
I don't wanna let you go!

26,Bruce Springsteen,Born to Run,1975,"In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and stepping out over the line
Baby, this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We got to get out while we're young
Because tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Wendy let me in, I want to be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs around these velvet rims 
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run until we drop, baby we'll never go back
Will you walk with me out on the wire
Because baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I got to find out how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Girl, I want to know if love is real

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rear-view mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I want to die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Someday girl I don't know when we're going to get to that place
Where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun
But until then tramps like us, baby we were born to run"

For you are beautiful
And I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful
And I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful
And I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
And my ship be torn apart upon the sea
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
In the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return safe home again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale

And I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful

61,Janis Ian,At Seventeen,1975,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired.
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
and murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity please the ones who serve,
They only get what they deserve""
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
Indebentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen

To those of us who know the pain
of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, come dance with me
and murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeen"

Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found
The same old fears.
Wish you were here."

Only yesterday

92,Led Zeppelin,Kashmir,1975,"Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face, with stars to fill my dream.
I am a traveler of both time and space to be where I have been.
To sit with elders of a gentle race this world has seldom seen.
Who talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed.
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace

Sounds caress my ear.
Though not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear.
Whoa-oh-hoh

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Oooh, oh, baby, I've been flyin'
No, yeah, mama cares, ain't no denyin'
Oh, oooh yeah, I've been flyin'

My mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin', no...
Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground.

And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land.
Tryin' to find, tryin' to find where I've been, ah-ah, ah-ah...
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
like thoughts inside a dream.
Heed the path that led me to that place with yellow desert stream.
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again.

Sure as the dust that blows high in June, when movin' through Kashmir.
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face

Along the straits of fear.
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-hoh, oh, ohh
Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way you stay, yeah-eah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down, oh
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down, so down...
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there...

96,Smokie,If You Think You Know How to Love Me,1975,"A breathless drive on a downtown street
Motorbike ride in the mid-day heat
The dust that hung from the desert skies
Run, though we run it still burned our eyes

Oh, yes we can walk on the wild wild side of life
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side
And in the shadows of a promise, you can take my hand
And show me the way to understand

So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

Yes, if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

A reckless night in a nameless town
Then we moved out of sight with a silent sound
A beach that wept with deserted waves
That's where we slept, knowing we'd be safe

Now you may think you can walk on the wild wild side with me
But there's a lot I can learn, and a lot that I've yet to see
You know you've got my life lying in your hands
It's up to you to make me understand

So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

Yes, if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
Yes, if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really really want me to stay

And I'm so glad that you've rectified my mind
This will be an everlasting love for me

Loving you is so kind of wonderful
Because you show me just how much you care
You've given me the thrill of a lifetime
And made me believe you've got more thrills to spare, oh
This will be an everlasting love, oh yes, it will now

You've brought a lot of sunshine into my life
You've filled me with happiness I never knew
You gave me more joy than I ever dreamed of
And no one, no one can take the place of you, ooh

Hugging and squeezing and kissing and pleasing
Together, forever, through rain or whatever

98,Telly Savalas,If,1975,"We smelled your soup on the fire cooking
We saw your toys and your pencils looking bright
So bright and yet they come from oh so far away
We heard your flags and your banners flapping
We felt the air from from your hands all clapping time
In time, I'm sure your time is not so far away
Millions, all moving forward
Millions, all babbling crossword
Millions, all flow at water
Millions, all bright with laughter
He make you glowing
He bake you golden like a yangtse mud
I saw your writing on paper landing
Your stamps showed bridges and temples standing still
So still, and yet they're standing oh so far away
I saw you asking for western thinking
I say it's poison that you'll be drinking
Stay as East, as far away as dreams will let you be"
