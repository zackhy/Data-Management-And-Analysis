1,Leona Lewis,Bleeding Love,2008,"Closed off from love
I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen

But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking around
Thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing

You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goalIs to keep me from falling

But nothing's greater than the rush
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vain
That I keep on closing

You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Oh, they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars
For everyone to see

I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vain
That I keep on closing

You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love"
2,Katy Perry,I Kissed A Girl,2008,"This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave
Drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you

Caught my attention

I kissed a girl
And I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong

It felt so right

Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl
And I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter

You're my experimental game
Just human nature

It's not what
Good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

I kissed a girl
And I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl
Just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl
And I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin
Red lips
So kissable
Hard to resist
So touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal
It's innocent

I kissed a girl
And I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl
And I liked it
I liked it"

I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money
I'm not gonna pay his rent (nope)
I got a brand new attitude and

So, so what
I'm still a rock star

The waiter just took my table
And gave it to Jessica Simps (shit!)
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy
At least he'll know how to hit
What if this song's on the radio
Then somebody's gonna die
I'm gonna get in trouble
My ex will start a fight

Na na na na na na na he's gonna start a fight

You weren't there
You never were
You want it all
But that's not fair

I gave you life
I gave my all
You weren't there
You let me fall.

All of the people start to rush, start to rush by
How does he twist the dance? Can't find a drink, oh man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record baby but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?

The way you're twirlin' up them hips 'round and 'round
And now there's no reason at all why you can't leave here with me

Like a girl changes clothes

Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch, I would know
And you over think
Always speak critically
I should know

That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot then you're cold

You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out

Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain boring

Got a case of a love bipolar

Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

8,Jason Mraz,I am Yours,2008,"Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks, and I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my best test
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

I won't hesitate no more,
No more, it cannot wait I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We are just one big family
It's your god forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved

So, I won't hesitate no more,
No more, it cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

-d-do do you but do you, d-d-do but you want to come one
Scooch one over closer dear and I will nibble your ear
Bap bap bap woooooo ho ho ooooh

I've been spending' way too long checking' my tongue in the mirror
And bending' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
My breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and laughed
I guess what I'm a saying's there isn't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

I won't hesitate no more,
No more, it cannot wait I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find, that the sky is yours

So please don't, don't please don't
(There's no need to complicated)
Cause our time is short
This is, this is, this is our fate
I'm yours"
9,Kid Rock,All summer long,2008,We do not have the lyrics for All Summer Long yet.
10,Coldplay,Viva La Vida,2008,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"

12,Beyonce,If I Were a Boy,2008,"If I were a boy even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted
And go drink beer with the guys

And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
And you don't understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you're taking her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy"

16,Jordin Sparks & ,No Air,2008,"Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?

If I should die before I wake
It's cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh

I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, It's incomplete

If there was a way that I could make you understand
But how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
Cause my world revolves around you, it's so hard for me to breathe
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?

Can't live, Can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep

Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air, air

No air, air
No air, air
No air, air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground To float to you
With no gravity to hold me down for real

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath but I survived
I don't know how but I don't even care

So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
Cause my world revolves around you, it's so hard for me to breathe
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, Can't breathe with no air

That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?

If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air, air
No air, air

No air, air
No air, air
No more
Baby

Theres no air, no air
No air, oh!
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
I can't live, I can't breathe with no air

That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
I can't live, I can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air
No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No air"
17,Sara Bareilles,Love Song,2008,"Head under water
And they tell me
to breathe easy for a while

The breathing gets harder,
even I know that
Made room for me

but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
Blank stares at blank pages

No easy way to say this
You mean well,
but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you tell me it's

make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving

I'ma need a better reason to write you a love song today, today
I learned the hard way
That they all say
things you want to hear

And my heavy heart
sinks deep down under
You and your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You are not what
I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
Convinced me to please you

Made me think
that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you tell me it's
make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'ma need a better reason to write you a love song today
Promise me
that you'll leave the light on
To help me see
with daylight, my guide, gone
'cause I believe
there's a way
you can love me Because I say
I won't write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you tell me it's
make or break in this
Is that why you wanted a love song?
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you tell me it's
make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If your heart is nowhere
in it I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas
when I believe that there's a reason to write you
a love song today,
today"

Just touched down in London town.
Bet they give me a pound.
Tell them put the money in my hand right now.
Tell the promoter we need more seats,
We just sold out all the floor seats

[Chorus:]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American Boy.

He said ""Hey Sister
It's really really nice to meet ya""
I just met this 5 foot 7 guy who's just my type.
I like the way he's speaking his confidence is peaking.
Don't like his baggy jeans but I'ma like what's underneath em
And no I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's all the way.
First let's see the West end.
I'll show you to my brethen.
I'm like this American Boy. American Boy

[Repeat Chorus:]

Can we get away this weekend
Take me to Broadway
Let's go shopping baby then we'll go to a Cafe
Let's go on the subway
Take me to your hood
I neva been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
Dress in all your fancy clothes
Sneaker's looking fresh to def I'm lovin those shell toes
Walkin' that walk
Talk that slick talk

I always act a fool oww oww. Aint nothing new now now.
He crazy, I know what ya thinkin. Ribena, I know what you're drinkin.
Rap singer. Chain Blinger.
Holla at the next chick soon as you're blinkin'. What's your persona. I got this American Brahma.
Am I shallow cuz all my clothes designer.
Dressed smart like a London bloke. Before he speak his suit bespoke.
And you thought he was cute before. Look at this P Coat, Tell me he's broke.
And I know you're not into all that. I heard your lyrics I feel your spirit.
But I still talk that C-A-A-ASH.
Cuz a lot wags want to hear it. And I'm feelin' like Mike at his Baddest.
The Pips at they Gladys.
And I know they love it.
So to hell with all that rubbish

Could you be my love, my love.
Would you be my American Boy. American Boy

29,Leona Lewis,Better in Time,2008,"It's been the longest winter without you

I didn't know where to turn to

See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through
Going coming thought I heard a knock
Who's there no one

Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice you mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'm gonna be OK
Thought I couldn't live without you

It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to

It'll all get better in time
I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings
If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh

Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in
And I know that time will heal it
If you didn't notice boy you meant everything

Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'm gonna be OK
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too

It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me
It's time I let you go
So I can be free
And live my life how it should be
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you
Yes I will

Thought I couldn't live without you

It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time"
30,The Pussycat Dolls,I Hate This Part,2008,"We're driving slow through the snow on 5th Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside but between us it's worse in here
The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through my fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here
Everyday, seven takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now 'fore we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?
The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here
I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
'Cause I see sunset in your eyes
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
That I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I hate this part
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it, oh
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here

31,Amy Macdonald,This is the Life,2008,"Oh the wind whistles down
The cold dark street tonight
And the people they were dancing
To the music vibe

And the boys chase the girls, with curls in their hair
While shy tormented youth sit way over there
And the songs get louder each one better than before

And you singing the song thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you singing the song thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight

So you're heading down the road in your taxi for 4
And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door
But nobody's in and nobody's home till 4
So you're sitting there with nothing to do
Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew
And where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?"
32,Kanye West,Love Lockdown,2008,"I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screamin' ""No! No! No! N-No!""
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you

So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
You lose

I'm not lovin' you the way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true

I got somethin to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone

How many times did I tell ya fo it finally got through
You lose, you lose
I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing' time, where's the finish line

So keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down
Your love locked down

Now keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
You lose

I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
I know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' goin'
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to

So keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
Your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down
You lose, you lose
You lose, you lose
You lose"

Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance

You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye

There is no message we're receiving
Let me know is your heart still beating?

Keep hoping for that the door is yours
Keep also home, cause I don't wanna live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'

Oh, can you see what I see?

Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could...

52,Coldplay,Violet Hill,2008,"Was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow
White snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low
If you love me
Won't you let me know?
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze
If you love me
Won't you let me know?
I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below
So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?
I took my love down to violet hill
Then we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me
Won't you let me know?
If you love me
Won't you let me know?"

I'm sorry honey, but I'm passing up, now look this way
Well there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they want it's easy if you do it right

To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere

There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right, it's just like de ja vu
Me standing here with you

So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end?
Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to go it on their own

And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

You can't give up, (when you're looking for) a diamond in the rough (cause you never know)
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on

Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh
Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

A family of trees wanting to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it

A baby is born crying out for attention
The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

There's a place that I go that nobody knows
Where the rivers flow and I call it home
And there's no more lies in the darkness there's light
And nobody cries, there's only butterflies

Take me away, a secret place
A sweet escape, take me away
Take me away to better days
Take me away, a hiding place

Take me away, a secret place
A sweet escape, take me away
Take me away to better days
Take me away, a hiding place

Take me away
  (I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine)
A secret place
  (I got a love and I know that it's all mine)
To better days take me away
Take me away
  (I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine)
A secret place
  (I got a love and I know that it's all mine)
Take me away, a hiding place

The sun is on my side and takes me for a ride
I smile up to the sky, I know I'll be alright
The sun is on my side and takes me for a ride

67,Lupe Fiasco,Superstar,2008,"If you are what they say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
If you are that they say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show

A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check two one two
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design? Did you do something new?
Well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me
I'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy as Heaven, the devil on my two tons too
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

If you are what they say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid
And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

If you are that they say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show


So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M;'s are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autographed picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha...
Ha ha ha ha ha... ha

If you are what they say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
If you are that they say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show"

I was all in da club havin' a drink no one on the suite
When I peeped this little freak out
I was all on the bar when drifter
Shawty Redd came over
Then she hit the floor, now

With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home
With them real big hips, she's so right I'm gon' beat

So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves although with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, ""Lil' mama, what you drink?""
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say ****""

See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cuz I wanted her to have an eruption

Everything he wants he gets, cause everything he
does is kinda necessary
I believe in love, tell me can anything last forever

Life can live up to love, Got a hand on my heart

I'm never saying never
You're gonna make me, make me love you,
nothing at all, nothing that I do

started to fade, fade

You're gonna make me, make me love you,
nothing at all, that I cannot do

feel you near

Giving up just looking into windows, yeah I've had

enough of wishing I've found you, baby don't you

So here I am, walking Primrose, wondering when

I'm gonna see you again
I've got my hands all ready to touch your soul,
I'm gonna get the energy to wire me close to you,
Got my eyes on the prize I see,
Are you watching me baby?
Cause my heart is turning to solid gold,
And my head is saying honey too good to be true,
Oh one look in your glitter eyes,
How else telling me every time
You're gonna make me, make me love you,
nothing at all, nothing that I do
Promise I made, promise I made, started to fade,

Maybe it's not that hard to know you
Maybe we'll make it up and go
Maybe we'll work things out, there's only one
way up and one way down I know
If you wanna convince me start again,
If you wanna be with me in my arms
You're gonna make me, make me love you,
nothing at all, nothing that I do

That David played and it pleased the Lord

Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Is how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart

I look around
Turn the radio down
He says
""Baby, is somethin' wrong?
I say
""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slammin' screen door

Sneakin' out late
Tappin' on your window

When we're on the phone
And you talk real slow

'Cause it's late
And your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date
""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home
'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he

Could play it again
I was walkin' up
The front porch steps

After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
Or been trampled on
And lost
And thrown away

Got to the hallway
Well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice

All the roses
And the note that said
Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late
Tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone
And you talk real slow
'Cause it's late
And your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date
""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home
'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again
I've heard every album
Listened to the radio
Waited for something
To come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late
Tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone
And he talks real slow
'Cause it's late
And his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date
""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home
before I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again
Play it again
I was ridin' shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

Dive in other waters

To waste tomorrow

Is acting like she used to be
Dancing like there's no-one there
Before she ever seemed to care
Now she wouldn't dare
It's so rock and roll to be alone

And they'll meet one day, far away
And say ""I wish I was something more""
And they'll meet one day, far away
And say ""I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before""

She's never seen a shade of grey
Always something on her mind,
Every single day
But now she's lost her way
And where does she go from here

Mr Multicultural
Sees all that one could see
He's living proof of someone
Very different to me
But now he wants to be free,
Free so he can see

And they'll meet one day, far away
And say ""I wish I was something more""
And they'll meet one day, far away
And say ""I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before""

He'll say ""I wish I knew you, I wish I met you when time was still on my side""
She'll say ""I wish I knew you, I wish I loved you before I was his bride""

And so they must depart
Too many more broken hearts
But I've seen that all before
In TV, books and film and more
And there's a happy ending
Every single day

And they'll meet one day, far away
And say ""I wish I was something more""
And they'll meet one day, far away
And say ""I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"""

Another way to die 

Another tricky little gun giving solace to the one that will never see the sunshine

Another dirty money, heaven sent honey turning on a dime

Hey, If I were you then It would be me that I go home with
3, the one and only
One thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl ""ooo he can get it""
Admit it
You did it
Let's hop a cab and split it
I'm kiddin
We both going to where you livin
HA, I got you gigglin like I'm piglet
Oh that's the ticket
I hope you are more like anita baker than robin givens
No, I don't know that lady so let me quit it
I'm just style freein, freestylin with ya'll soundin you
That's just what I'm telling you
Should be in bed with you
Like I've been in jail for two
Years and then they let me loose

[Chorus]

[Andre 3000:]
You got you one legend
Sometimes you gotta step from behind the piano
And let em know what's going on
Even stevie wonder got down sometimes
I'm ready to go"
98,Akon,I'm So Paid,2008,"Rubbing' on that Italian leather
Dem' konvict jeans on!
Ay yo Weezy! You Ready?
Yeah!

I get it in 'till the sunrise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming ""Ahhh!!!""
Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid
Number one hustla gettin money
Why do you wanna count my money?
I'ma hustla don't need them! One of ya'll ya see!

I'm so paid

I see police on the crooked I
Doing a 100 on the Interstate 95
My shawty leanin' blasting that Do or Die
Pushin' that motherfuckin' wood cuz we certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off
I'm a sniper sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me

Then let them haters come and make the name of me
That's why?

I get it in 'till the sunrise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming ""Ahhh!!!""
Hey-ey-ey… I'm so paid
Number one hustla gettin money

Why do you wanna count my money?
I'ma hustla don't need them! One of ya'll ya see!
I'm so paid

I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off that's all
Guess what I won't be taking that fall
Homie I got cake that's what I'm paying them for (aha!)
Ain't that funny?
Cuz niggas want war but ain't got money
Cuz I've seen them all talking 'till they start gunnin'
Quicker than Usain Bolt the fastest thing running

Yeah! Akon! Weezy!
Block oil holdin' down Jersey
Devine making sure we gettin' it up front
My little brother Boo got that vision bake it!

I get it in 'till the sunrise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming ""Ahhh!!!""

I'ma hustla don't need them! One of ya'll ya see!

Oh-oh
Big money Weezy
White wife beater with the sig underneath it
How do I feel bitch I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers disappear from the precinct
Yeah!
I'm ballin' we ball out
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns to y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house
Damn!
But I thought you was tough though
We, carry choppers on our necks call it cut throat
We, bury cowards on the set that they come from
We, know magic turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We, bomb first when we ride
You, in a hearse when you ride

Ay-yay
I put my shoe down baby
And I'm holding down Young Mula baby!
That's why?
I get it in 'till the sunrise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming ""Ahhh!!!""

99,Demi Lovato & Joe Jonas,This is Me,2008,"I've always been the kind of girl
That hid my face
So afraid to tell the world
What I've got to say
But I have this dream
Right inside of me
I'm gonna let it show, it's time
To let you know
To let you know

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light, shine on me
Now I've found, who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me

Do you know what it's like
To feel so in the dark
To dream about a life
Where you're the shining star
Even though it seems
Like it's too far away
I have to believe in myself
It's the only way

This is real, This is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light, shine on me
Now I've found, who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you, I gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you, I gotta find you

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light, shine on me
Now I've found, who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me

You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me (this is me)
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
Now I've found, who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me"
