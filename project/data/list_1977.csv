1,Eagles,Hotel California,1977,"On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air

Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself:
""This could be heaven or this could be hell""

Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face

Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends

How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain:
""Please bring me my wine""
He said: ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""

And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face

They're living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device""

And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before

""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave"""
2,Bee Gees,How Deep is Your Love?,1977,"I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall

And you may not think, I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me"

4,Boney M,Ma Baker,1977,"Freeze, I'm Ma Baker, put your hands in the air
Gimme all your money
This is the story of Ma Baker, the meanest cat
From old Chicago town

She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat
She really moved them down
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

She was the meanest cat
Oh she was realy tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
'Cause they were mean and strong

But she knew how to die

She met a man she liked
She thought she'd stay with him
One day he formed with them
They did away with him
She didn't care at all
Just didn't care at all

(Here is special bulletin
Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman
Her photo is hanging on every post office wall
If you have any information about this woman
Please contact your nearest police station)

(Don't anybody move, the money or your lives)

One day they robbed a bank
It was their last hooray
The cops appeared too soon
They couldn't get away
And all the loot they had
It made them mighty mad

And so they shot it out
Ma Baker and her sons
They didn't want to hang
They died with blazing guns
And so the story ends
Of one who left no friends

She taught her four sons

5,Wings,Mull of Kintyre,1977,"Der ganze song hat leider nicht gepasst, es fehlt eine zeile und dieses Programm schafft es nicht sie hier einzubringen!!!!

Mull of Kintyre
Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh, Mull of Kintyre

Far have I travelled, and much have I seen
Dark distant mountains with valleys of green
Past painted deserts, the sunset's on fire
As he carries me home to the Mull of Kintyre

Mull of Kintyre
Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh, Mull of Kintyre

Sweep through the heather like deer in the glen
Carry me back to the days I knew then
Of the life and the times of the Mull of Kintyre

Mull of Kintyre
Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh, Mull of Kintyre

Smiles in the sunshine and tears in the rain
Still take me back where my memories remain
Flickering embers grow higher and higher
As they carry me back to the Mull of Kintyre

Mull of Kintyre Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here Oh, Mull of Kintyre"

7,Debbie Boone,You Light Up My Life,1977,"So many nights, I sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams, I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark, but now you've come along

You light up my life, you give me hope to carry on
You light up my days and fill my nights with song

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey
I love You, never again to be all alone

You light up my life, you give me hope to carry on
You light up my days and fill my nights with song

You light up my life, you give me hope to carry on
You light up my days and fill my nights with song

It can't be wrong when it feels so right
'Cause you, you light up my life"
8,Queen,We Are the Champions,1977,"I've paid my dues time after time
I've done my sentence but committed no crime
And bad mistakes, I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face but I've come through
And I need to go on and on and on and on

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions of the world

I've taken my bows and my curtain calls
You've brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses, no pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race and I ain't gonna lose
And I need to go on and on and on and on

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions of the world

And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions"
9,Leo Sayer,When I Need You,1977,"When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so wanna give you
Is only a heartbeat away
When I need love
I hold out my hand and I touch love

I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be traveling forever
It's cold out, but hold out
And do like I do
When I need you

I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so wanna give you babe
Is only a heartbeat away
It's not easy when the road is your driver
But honey that's the heavy load that we bear

But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime
It's cold out, but hold out
And do like I do
Oh, I need you

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day

When I need you
Just close my eyeeeeeeees
And you'r right here by my side

Keeping my warm night and day
I just hold out my hands
I just hold out my hands
And I'm with you darling
Yes I'm with you darling
All I wanna give you
It's only a heartbeat away
Oh, I need you darling
Oh, I want you darling..."
10,Andy Gibb,I Just Wanna Be Your Everything,1977,"For so long you and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong, girl take it from me
If you give a little more than you're asking for your love will turn the key

I'd do anything to be your everything

12,Barbra Streisand,Love Theme From 'A Star is Born' (Evergreen),1977,"Love soft as an easy chair
Love fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two
You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance I unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love
Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen"

Knowing me, knowing you

Knowing me, knowing you

Breaking up is never easy, I know
But I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you

In these old familiar rooms
Children would play

16,Smokie,Living Next Door to Alice,1977,"Sally called when she got the word
She said ""I suppose you've heard, 'bout Alice""
So I rushed to the window and I looked outside
And I could hardly believe my eyes
As a big limousine rode up into Alice's drive.
Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty-four years just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance
Now I gotta get used to not living next door to Alice
We grew up together, two kids in the park
Carved out initials deep in the bark, me and Alice
Now she walks through the door, with her head held high
Just for a moment I caught her eye
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive
Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty-four years just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance
Now I gotta get used to not living next door to Alice
Sally called back, and asked how I felt
She said, ""I know how to help, get over Alice""
She said, ""Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here
You know I've been waiting twenty-four years...""
And the big limousine disappeared
I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty-four years just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance

Now, I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice"
17,Julie Covington,Don't Cry For Me Argentina,1977,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence, I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me
Don't cry for me Argentina
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence, I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true"

20,David Soul,Don't Give Up On Us,1977,"Don't give up on us, baby
don't make the wrong seem right
the future isn't just one night
it's written in the moonlight
painted on the stars
we can't change ours
Don't give up on us, baby
we're still worth one more try
i know we put a last one by
just for a rainy evening
when maybe stars are few
don't give up on us, i know
we can still come through
I really lost my head last night
you've got a right to start believin'
there's still a little love left, even so
Don't give up on us, baby
lord knows we've come this far
can't we stay the way we are?
the angel and the dreamer
who sometimes plays a fool
don't give up on us, i know
we can still come through

It's written in the moonlight
painted on the stars
we can't change ours
Don't give up on us, baby
we're still worth one more try
i know we put a last one by
just for a rainy evening
when maybe stars are few
don't give up on us, i know
we can still come through
Don't give up on us, baby
don't give up on us, baby"
21,Carly Simon,Nobody Does it Better,1977,"Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best

I wasn't lookin', but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like Heaven above me, the spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why'd you have to be so good?

The way that you hold me whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin', but just keep it comin'
How'd you learn to do the things you do?

And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, baby, darling, you're the best

Baby, you're the best
Baby, you're the best
Baby, you're the best

22,Rod Stewart,You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim),1977,"I didn't know what day it was
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon

Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical

I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, beardsly prints
I put down to experience

The big bosomed lady with the dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad-lib lines were well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance

You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But honey, what do you see in me?

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

You're an essay in glamor
Please pardon the grammar
But you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, united, but baby I've decided
You're the best team I've ever seen

And there have been many affairs
Many times I've thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
'Cause you're the warmest thing I've ever found

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

You're in my heart, you're in my soul

That I just can't describe

Well, who am I to keep you down?

Play the way you feel it

Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
Now here I go again
I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to
Wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Ooh, what you lost

On a barstool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over

I sat down and asked her name
When the drink finally hit her
She said I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams

I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever
The other life brings

In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watch him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman

Who sat their beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain

For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shakin'
His big heart was breakin'
He turned to the woman and said

""You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille

I've had some bad times
Lived thru' some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille""

After he left us, I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she made him look small
From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all

She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I lost my mind
I couldn't hold her, 'coz the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille

Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Why not think about times to come?
And not about the things that you've done
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before

He has found a better way

Feel so good, feel so good, it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting

In the trees blow in the night
In the southern skies

Southern skies it's precious beauty
Lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through your soul like the stories of old

Old man he and his dog they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy"

Somebody could choose me
No more standin' there beside the walls
I done got myself together baby
And now I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
Might wanna make romance
Move your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me spread out and let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone
Move it up
Turn it 'round
Ooo Shake it down
OOWWWW
You can love me when you want to babe
This is such a groovy party baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine!
You're movin your body easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin' baby
You wanna turn me out
Think I'm gonna let you do it babe

In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime

She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came

In the year of the cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears

By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, ""I feel my life
Just like a river running through""

The year of the cat

Why she looks at you so coolly?
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside

The year of the cat

Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket
So you have to stay on

But the drumbeat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay

In the year of the cat

The red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain, I gaze the sun doesn't shine
The rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden, I see the west purple shower, bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
The playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask
Oh, is it cool? Is it cool?

If you arrive and don't see me, I'm going to be, be with my baby
I am free, flying in her arms, over the sea
Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kites, with velvet roses diggin' freedom flight

She wanted to get on down, that woman wanted get on down
She did that dip again, and I hit the floor again
She was gettin' down, Lord, that woman was gettin' down

88,Smokie,Needles & Pins,1977,"I saw her today
I saw her face
It was a face I loved and I knew
I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they'd go away
And still they begin

Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide

Oh, I thought I was smart
I'd won a heart, didn't think I do
But now you see
She's worse to him than me
Let her go ahead
And take his love instead
And one day she will see
Just how to say ""Please""

And get down on her knees
That's how they begin
You'll feel those needles and pins
Hurtin' her, hurtin' her

What can't I stop
And tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong?
What can't I stand up
And tell myself I'm strong?

Because I saw her today
I saw her face
It was a face I loved and I knew
I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they'd go away
And still they begin

Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide

Needles and pins
Needles and pins

89,Paul Simon,Slip Slidin' Away,1977,"(Mmm mmm, mmm mmm)
Slip sliding away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

I know a man
He came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said, ""Dolores, I live in fear""
My love for you is so overpowering
I'm afraid that I will disappear

Slip sliding away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip sliding away

And I know a woman
Became a wife
These are the very words she uses
To describe her life
She said ""A good day, ain't got no rain""
She said ""A bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been""

Slip sliding away
Slip slidin' away
(Ooh ooh)
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip sliding away

And I know a father
Who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons
For the things he'd done
He came a long way, just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again

He's slip slidin'
Slip sliding away
(Ooh ooh)
You know the nearer your destination
  (Ooh ooh ooh)
The more you're slip slidin' away

And God only knows
God makes his plan
The information's unavailable
To the mortal man
We work in our jobs, collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway
  (Ooh ooh ooh)
When in fact we're slip slidin' away

Slip sliding away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
  (Aah aah aah)
The more you're slip slidin' away

Slip sliding away
Slip sliding away
You know the nearer your destination

90,Peter Gabriel,Solsbury Hill,1977,"Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen had no choice
I did not believe the information
(I) just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
""Son,"" he said ""Grab your things,
I've come to take you home.""

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Tho' my life was in a rut
""Till I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey"" he said ""Grab your things
I've come to take you home.""
(Back home.)

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey"" I said ""You can keep my things,
they've come to take me home."" "

Running away forever

Running away from danger
Hiding from every stranger

94,Peter McCann,Do You Wanna Make Love?,1977,"Sometimes the love rhymes that fill that afternoon
Lose all their meaning with the rising moon
Hold me and tell me that the words you say are true
Answer the question I must ask of you

Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down, if you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously or take it somewhere else

Take all the freedom that a lover will allow
If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now
Where love goes, a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep
Don't make a promise that you cannot keep

Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down, if you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously or take it somewhere else

If you wanna get close to me
You could do it so easily
Is it love that I see when I look in your eyes
Or just another empty lie?

Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down, if you try and fool yourself
Well, do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously or take it somewhere else"

Looking just the same as you did last time I touched you
And here I am
Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you
Do you love him?
As much as I love her
Will that love be strong?
When old feelings start to stir

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way
To another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so 'til today
Until you were there everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

Love's so strange
Playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting
And we're the fools
Standing close enough to touch those burning memories

And if I hold you for the sake of all those times
Love made us lose our minds
Could I ever let you go...

Oh, no we made it
Left each other on the way to another love...
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so 'til today
Until you were there everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it
Ohhhhhh, we made it
Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so 'til today
Until you were there everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it...
Looks like we made it...
Oh, babe we made it..."

By: Jimmy Buffett 
1977 
Nibblin' on sponge cake 
Watchin' the sun bake 
All of those tourists covered with oil 
Strummin' my six-string 
On my front porch swing 
Smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to boil 

Chorus: 
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville 
Searching for my lost shaker of salt 
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame 
But I know it's nobody's fault 

I don't know the reason 
I stayed here all season 
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo 
But it's a real beauty 
A Mexican cutie 
How it got here I haven't a clue 

Chorus: 
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville 
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt 
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame 
Now I think 
Hell, it could be my fault 

I blew out my flip-flop 
Stepped on a pop-top 
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home 
But there's booze in the blender 
And soon it will render 
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on 

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville 
Searching for my lost shaker of salt 
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame 
But I know it's my own damn fault 
Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame 
And I know it's my own damn fault"

98,Kansas,Carry on my Wayward Son,1977,"Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man

Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin', I can hear them say

Carry on, my wayward son
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion

Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say

Carry on, my wayward son
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more"
