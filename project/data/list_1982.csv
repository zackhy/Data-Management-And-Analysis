20,Charlene,I've Never Been to Me,1982,"Hey lady, you lady
cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother
and a regimented wife
I 've no doubt
you dream about the things you never do
but I wish someone had a talk to me like I wanna talk to you

Ooh, I've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man
and we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free

I've been to paradise but I've never been to me...

Please lady please lady
don't just walk away
'cause I have this need to tell you
why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me
still living in your eyes

won't you share a part
of a weary heart that has lived a million lives

Ooh, I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
when I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
and showed them what I've got

I've been undressed by kings
and I've seen some things that a woman ain't s'posed to see
I've been to paradise but I've never been to me...

Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
a fantasy we created about people and places
as we like them to be
but you know what truth is?

it's that little baby you're holding
and it's that man you fought with this morning
the same one you are gonna make love to tonight
that's truth that's love

Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children
that might have made me complete
but I, I took the sweet life
I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet
I spent my life exploring
the subtle whoring
that costs too much to be free
Hey lady I've been to paradise
but I've never been to me...

I've been to paradise - never been to me
(I've been to Georgia and California, and anywhere I could run)
I've been to paradise - never been to me
(I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
While I sipped champagne on a yacht)
I've been to paradise - never been to me

21,Supertramp,It's Raining Again,1982,"Oh, it's raining again
Oh no, my love's at an end

And you know it's hard to pretend

Oh no, it's raining again
Too bad I'm losing a friend
Oh no, it's raining again
Oh will my heart ever mend

To read the signs and walk away
It's only time that heals the pain
And makes the sun come out again

22,Quarterflash,Harden My Heart,1982,"Cryin' on the corner, waitin' in the rain
I swear I'll never, ever wait again
You gave me your word but words for you are lies

Darlin', in my wildest dreams
I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know, oh

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

All of my life I've been waitin' in the rain
I've been waitin' for a feeling that never, ever came
It feels so close but always disappears

Darlin', in your wildest dreams
You never had a clue
But it's time you got the news

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

Darlin' in my wildest dreams
I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know, ho

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears

Harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
Oh oh oh oh
Harden my heart

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears

Harden my heart, harden my heart
Swallow my tears
I'm gonna harden my heart"
23,Falco,Der Kommissar,1982,"Two, three, four, eins, zwei, drei
Es is nichts dabei
Wenn ich euch erzaehle die Geschichte
Nichts desto trotz, ich bin es schon gewohnt
Im tv-funk da laeuft es nicht, jah
Sie war so jung, das Herz so rein und weiss
Und jede Nacht hat ihren Preis
Sie sagt: ""Sugar sweet, jah'got me rapp'in to the heat!""
Sie sagt: Babe you know, I miss my Funky friends""
Sie meint, Jack und Jill
Mein funk Verstaendnis reicht zur Not
Ich ueberreiss' was sie jetzt will
Ich ueberlege bei mir, ihre Nase spricht dafuer
Waehrend dessen ich noch rauche
Die ""special places"" sind ihr wohlbekannt
Ich meine, sie faehrt ja U-bahn auch dort singen's:
Dreh dich nicht um - oh, oh, oh
Der Kommissar geht um - oh, oh, oh
Er wird dich anschauen, und du weisst warum
Die Lebenslust bringt dich um
Alles klar Herr Kommissar?
(Hey man, wanna buy some stuff man?
Did you ever rap that thing Jack, so rap it to the beat)
Wir treffen Jill und Joe und dessen Bruder hip,
Und auch den Rest der koolen gang
Sie rappen hin, sie rappen her
Dazwischen kratzen's ab die Waend'
Dieser Fall ist klar lieber Herr Kommissar
Auch wenn sie anderer Meinung sind
Den Schnee auf dem wir alle talwaerts fahren
Kennt heute jedes Kind
Jetzt das Kinderlied
Dreh dich nicht um - oh, oh, oh
Der Kommissar geht um - oh, oh, oh
Er hat die Kraft und wir sind klein und dumm
Und dieser Frust macht uns stumm
La, la, la,la, la
Dreh dich nicht um - oh, oh, oh
Der Kommissar geht um - oh, oh, oh
Wenn er dich anspricht und du weisst warum
Sag' ihm dein Leben bringt dich um
La, la, la, la, la
Dreh dich nicht um - oh, oh, oh
Der Kommissar geht um - oh, oh, oh"
24,Dionne Warwick,Heartbreaker,1982,"I've got to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing, but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around?

And I look into the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I've made a life out of loving you

Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love ever lasting
Feeling no pain, when will we meet again?

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by
This world may end
Not you and I

My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you and that cannot be reversed
You've made the rules and you could not see
You've made a life out of hurting me

Out of my mind, I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try, or should we say goodbye?

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by

Oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
My love for you

Oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by

Help me
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?"
25,Kim Wilde,Cambodia,1982,"Well he was Thailand based
She was an airforce wife
He used to fly weekends
It was the easy life
But then it turned around
And he began to change
She didn’t wonder then
She didn’t think it strange
But then he got a call
He had to leave that night
He couldn’t say too much
But it would be alright
He didn’t need to pack
They’d meet the next night
He had a job to do
Flying to Cambodia

And as the nights passed by
She tried to trace the past
The way he used to look
The way he used to laugh
I guess she’ll never know
What got inside his soul
She couldn’t make it out
Just couldn’t take it all
He had the saddest eyes
The girl had ever seen
He used to cry some nights
As though he lived a dream
Ans as she held him close
He used to search her face
As though she knew the truth
Lost inside Cambodia

But then a call came through
They said he’d soon be home
She had to pack a case
And they would make a rendez-vous
But now a year has passed
And not a single word
And all the love she knew
Has disappeared out in the haze
Cambodia - Don’t cry now - No tears now

And now the years have passed
With not a single word
But there is only one thing left
I know for sure
She won’t see his face again"
26,Laura Branigan,Gloria,1982,We do not have the lyrics for Gloria yet.
27,Frida,I Know There's Something Going On,1982,"I can see that it won't be long
You grow cold when you keep holding on
You know you've changed and your words they lie
That's something you can't deny

I know you're not at home
You're home but not alone
If you want to leave then why don't you say
Your love is gone anyway

I know it won't be long,
Won't be long before you're gone

There's something going on
There's something going on

I know a good thing must come to an end
But it's hard to take loosing a friend
I know what you think and what's in your mind
So darling don't quite pretend

I know it won't be long
It won't be long before you're gone

There's something going on
There's something going on
There's something going on
There's something going on

I know it won't be long
It won't be long before you're gone

There's something going on
There's something going on
There's something going on
There's something going on

I know there's something
I know there's something
I know there's something"
28,Duran Duran,Hungry Like the Wolf,1982,"Dark in the city night is a wire

Woman you want me give me a sign
And catch my breathin' even closer behind

And I'm hungry like the wolf

Stalked in the forest too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side

High blood drummin' on your skin it's so tight
You feel my heat I'm just a moment behind

In touch with the ground

Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine I'm after you
Mouth is alive all runnin' inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf

Burnin' the ground I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
I smell like I sound, I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Burnin' the ground I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you

I know she's mine, because the dog gone girl is mine

I don't understand the way you think,
saying that she's yours not mine,

you'll discover
that she's my girl forever and ever,

I dont build your hopes to be let down,
but i really feel its time,
I know she'll tell you i'm the one for her,

Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter!

37,Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five,The Message,1982,"It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with the baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got social security
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""You want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under"

54,The Human League,Mirror Man,1982,"The water shines
A pebble skips across the face
A dozen times
Then disappears, not a trace
Left behind
The thrower turns and walks away
A change of mind
Another start, a brand new day

You know I'll change
If change is what you require
Your every wish
Your every dream, hope, desire

Here comes the mirror man
Says he's a people fan
Here comes the mirror man

And if it seems
I'm not the one you used to know
Our little friendship
Left behind not long ago
Don't feel too hurt
As distance heals the strongest pain
Things are much better now
And just the nagging doubt remains

You know I'll change
If change is what you require
Your every wish
Your every dream, hope, desire

Here comes the mirror man
Says he's a people fan
Here comes the mirror man
Here comes the mirror man
Says he's a people fan
Here comes the mirror man

Here comes the mirror man
Says he's a people fan
Here comes the mirror man
(The mirror man
The mirror man)
Here comes the mirror man
Says he's a people fan
Here comes the mirror man
(The mirror man
The mirror man)
Here comes the mirror man
Says he's a people fan."

Never knew love was in the sights
I guess I missed the target
Caught up in a different line of fire

But I know since I've been aiming
For the sweetness in your soul
Your name is on the bullet
And it's gettin' ready to explode
There's been a change inside my life
And I just want to let you know

She said ya, ya gotta come out smokin'

I saw your love at twenty paces
And I knew I'd won the game
You better raise your heart up high
Or love will blow you right away

59,Stevie Wonder,That Girl,1982,"That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart

She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescue of love
That you'll leave torn apart

That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
'Cause she can please her man

She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long

Before I tell her that I love her, that I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to, to be in her love

I've been hurting for a long time
You've been playing for a long time
You know it's true

I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do, oh what we love to do
That girl, that girl, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand

She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize
Is that I've listened to every word

That's why I know I'll tell her that I love her and I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to, to be in her love

Tell her I love her, that I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to, to be in her love

That I love her, that I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I

Oh that I love her, that I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
I need to do all that I have to, to be in her

60,Dire Straits,Private Investigations,1982,"It's a mystery to me, the game commences
For the usual fee plus expenses
Confidential information, it's in a diary
This is my investigation, it's not a public inquiry

I go checking out the reports, digging up the dirt
You get to meet all sorts in this line of work
Treachery and treason, there's always an excuse for it
And when I find the reason, I still can't get used to it

And what have you got at the end of the day?
What have you got to take away?
A bottle of whiskey and a new set of lies
Blinds on the windows and a pain behind the eyes

Scarred for life, no compensation
Private investigations"
61,Journey,Open Arms,1982,"Lying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?

We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me, open arms

Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me, open arms"

I'll be far away and I say

Blue eyes holding back the tears
Holding back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear blue sky
Watching over me

Blue eyes
I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be, I will see

Blue eyes laughing in the sun
Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home and I am home again

Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home again"
63,Joe Jackson,Steppin' Out,1982,"Now, the mist across the window hides the lines
But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine
Electricity so fine
Look and dry your eyes

We, so tired of all the darkness in our lives
With no more angry words to say can come alive
Get into a car and drive to the other side
(Me babe, steppin' out)
Into the night, into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night, into the light

We are young but getting old before our time
We'll leave the TV and the radio behind
Don't you wonder what we'll find
Steppin' out tonight

You can dress in pink and blue just like a child
And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
We'll be there in just a while, if you follow me
(Me babe, steppin' out)
Into the night, into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night, into the light

I'm tryin' to show how much I love you

You're taking way too many chances

When you used to be
The talk of the town
All you get is lonely

Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how

But I need the girl to stay

All away

Taste of yesterday
But you stay at home
All they get is lonely

I can show you how
Turn your love around

That you're still in love with me

71,The Jam,A Town Called Malice,1982,"Better stop dreaming of the quiet life
Cos it's the one we'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus
Cos those rosey days are few
And - stop apologising for the things you've never done,
Cos time is short and life is cruel
But it's up to us to change
This town called malice.
Rows and rows of disused milk floats
Stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk
Bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing when tears come
Fast and furious
In a town called malice.

Struggle after struggle, year after year
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice
I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called malice.

A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids new gear
It's a big decision in a town called malice.

The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going round and round
Playground kids and creaking swings
Lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will
But I'd sooner put some joy back
In this town called malice
In this town called malice
In this town called malice..."

You and me got plenty of time

There's nobody in the future
So baby let me hand you my love
Oh no step for you to dance to
So slip your hand inside of my glove

Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me

I don't want no damage
But how'm I gonna manage with you?
Oh you want the percentage
But I'm the fool payin' the dues

I'm just around the corner
If you got a minute to spare
And I'll be waitin' for you
If you ever wanna be there

Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me

Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me

73,Abba,The Day Before You Came,1982,"I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned

I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away

At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see

I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light I must have yawned
And curled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came"
74,Elton John,Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny),1982,"What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared
I found an empty garden
Among the flagstones there

Who lived here he must have been a gardener
That cared a lot who weeded out the tears
And grew a good crop and now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

And what's it for this little empty garden
By the brownstone door and in the cracks
Along the sidewalk nothing grows no more

Who lived here he must have been a gardener
That cared a lot who weeded out the tears
And grew a good crop and we are so amazed
We're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one no one can replace

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger
If only he could hear

Who lived here he must have been a gardener
That cared a lot who weeded out the tears
And grew a good crop now we pray for rain
And with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out, can't you come out to play

Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden
Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden
Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden
Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden
Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden

79,Roxy Music,More Than This,1982,"I could feel at the time
There was no way of knowing
Fallen leaves in the night
Who can say where they're blowing?
As free as the wind
Hopefully learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning?

More than this, you know there is nothing
More than this, tell me one thing
More than this, there is nothing

It was fun for a while
There was no way of knowing
Like a dream in the night
Who can say where we're going?
No care in the world
Maybe I'm learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning?

More than this, you know there is nothing
More than this, tell me one thing
More than this, now there is nothing
More than this, nothing
More than this
More than this, nothing"

With a step to your left and a flick to the right
You catch that mirror way out west
You know you're something special and you look like you're the best

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TV
Two of a billion stars, it means so much to me
Like a birthday or a pretty view
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha

Hey now woo, look at that did he nearly run you down
At the end of the drive, the lawmen arrive you make me feel
Alive, alive, alive
I'll take my chance, 'cause luck is on my side
I'll tell you something, I know what you're thinking
I'll tell you something, I know what you're thinking

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twist across a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

Her name is Rio, she don't need to understand
And I might find her if I'm looking like I can
Oh Rio, Rio hear them shout across the land

And have to laugh
At the pages in between

‘Cos I just can’t face the world
I’ve grown to see

View from a bridge, can’t take anymore
View from a bridge, can’t take anymore

I saw you making her
In the soft sheets in between
But when you turned around
I saw your eyes were fire
And you crashed out all my dreams

And like a fool I just stood there
And let it go
I should have fought right back
And let my feelings show

View from a bridge, can’t take anymore
View from a bridge, can’t take anymore

To make a fool out of me
Well you cut me down
For the things you want
And now it’s killing me

I’ll lay it on the line now
You’re running out of time now

But then a voice said jump
And I just let go
And I’m floating out in space
But then I feel your arms
And I turn around
To a ghost without a face

And I just don’t know
What’s fact or fantasy
‘Cos when I look below the bridge
I see it’s me"

How could I resist the aroma of your perfume.
You and I were inseparable
it was love at first sight.
You made me promise to marry you
I made you promise to be my wife

But then you were only eight years old and I had just about turned nine.
I thought that life was always good
I thought you always would be mine.
It started with a kiss
never thought it would come to this.
It started with a kiss
never thought it would come to this.
I remember ev'ry little thing like fighting in the playground

As some good looking boy had started to hang around.
That boy hurt me so bad
but I was happy 'cause you cried. - still -
I couldn't help but notice that new distant look in your eyes

And then when you were sixteen
and I had just turned seventeen

I couldn't hold on to your love
I couldn't hold on to my dreams.

It started with a kiss
never thought is would come to this.
It started with a kiss
never thought it would come to this.
You don't remember me
do you? You don't remember me
do you?
Walking down the street came the star of my love story

And my heart began to beat so fast
so clear was my memory.
I heard my voice cry out her name
and as she looked and looked away
I felt so hurt
I felt so small
and it was all that I could say

You don't remember me
do you? You don't remember me
do you?
You don't remember me
do you? You don't remember me

There's a guy starting to realize
That he's eternal fate has turn it's back on him
It's two A.M.

It's two A.M. the fear has gone
I'm sitting here waitin' the gun still warm
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances

Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy

Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Double crossed messenger all alone
Can't get no connection, can't get through
Where are you?

Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hitman comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated

And he says, ""Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?""

I was on the outside when you said
You said you needed me
I was looking at myself, I was blind, I could not see

His mother takes him by his hand
If he stops to think he starts to cry, oh why

When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window, I was lost, I am found

Yeah you can see the look in her eye

Don't wait to see what you got

And ride until your head breaks
I'm a-walkin' 'til my brain pops
I will move with the beat now
I'm a chain 'round an A-bomb
I'm a ribbon in the heat now

Sit around and you'll be lonely
Saddle up and make the dust fly
Sit around and you will just cry.

Saddle up your horse and ride like hell!

Sit around and you'll be lonely
Saddle up and make the dust fly
Get on your high horse and ride

No use herding blues at rancho, rauncho
Put on your sombrero an your - poncho
Don't stay where trouble will find you
Go... while the getting is good
You'll find the end of a rainbow

Just as soon as you've understood.

A stranger

Hit the trail there's no mistaking
