1,Britney Spears,Baby One More Time,1999,"Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh, baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby, eh-eh-yeah

Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go

I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe?
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign

2,Ricky Martin,Livin' La Vida Loca,1999,"She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
Well, I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got new addictions
For every day and night
She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life

But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha

She will wear you out

Livin' la vida loca
Livin' la vida loca
She's livin' la vida loca
Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleepin' pill

She never drinks the water
Makes you order French champagne

Once you've had a taste of her
You'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane!
Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down

Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha

She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
Livin' la vida loca

She's livin' la vida loca
She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha

4,Rob Thomas & Santana,Smooth,1999,"Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my spanish harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Cause you're so smooth
()
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round
(Bridge)
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Cause you're so smooth
()
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it"
5,TLC,No Scrubs,1999,"A scrub is a guy that think he's fine and is
Also known as a buster (buster, buster)
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So

No, I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
Don't want none of your time and

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

But a scrub is checkin' me but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' no deadbeat ass
So (yeah, yeah)

No, I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)

Trying to holler at me

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yea son I'm talking to you
If you live at home wit' your momma
Oh yes son I'm talking to you (baby)
If you have a shorty but you don't show love
Oh yes son I'm talking to you
Wanna get with me with no money

See, if you can't spatially expand my horizons
Then that leaves you in a class with scrubs never risin'
I don't find it surprisin' if you don't have the g's
To please me and bounce from here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you somethin' to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screen
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular and then I get back to ya
With diamond like precision, insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's expedition
Mr. Big Willy if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho
Not really, T-Boz and all my señoritas
Is steppin' on your Filas but you don't hear me though
No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side..."

You are my fire
The one desire
Believe
When I say
I want it that way

But we are
Two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say

8,Christina Aguilera,Genie in a Bottle,1999,"I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me

You're licking your lips and blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby
  (Baby, baby, baby)

My body is saying let's go
But my heart is saying no

If you wanna be with me, baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression, I gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle baby, you gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby, come, come, come on and let me out

The music's fading and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then were good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me

Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby
  (Baby, baby, baby)

My body is saying let's go
But my heart is saying no

I feel like doing another Darkchild remix
'99, Darkchild, Jennifer

Come on and dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little

Now if I give you me
This is how it's got to be
First of all I won't take you cheating on me
And who can I trust, if I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool

You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me
You have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby

You said you want my love
And you've got to have it all
But first there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you tryin' to get with me
And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain
So before I do, give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby

Come on and dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little

Come on and dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Darkchild, Jennifer Lopez, come on

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?

11,Sixpence None The Richer,Kiss Me,1999,"Kiss me, out of the bearded barley
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand

Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance

Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me
Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight

Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me
Kiss me beneath the milky twilight

Lead me out on the moonlit floor

Lift your open hair
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me"

13,Shania Twain,That Don't Impress Me Much,1999,"I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius
you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original know-it-all

Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve - just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughtta lock it
‘Cause Heaven forbid it should fall out of place

Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you're Brad Pitt
That don't impress me much
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

You're one of those guys that likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
C'mon, baby, tell me - you must be joking right!

Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you've got a car
That don't impress me much
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much
You think you're cool but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
That don't impress me much
Okay, so what do you think, you're Elvis or something?
Whatever
That don't impress me
That don't impress me"

You're everywhere I go and everybody knows
To love you is to be part of you

Treat you right, be with you day and night (day and night)
All I really want is to hold you tight
Be with you day and night
Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight"
27,Blondie,Maria,1999,"She moves like she don't care
Smooth as silk, cool as air
Ooh it makes you wanna cry
She doesn't know your name
And your heart beats like a subway train
Ooh it makes you wanna die

Ooh, don't you wanna take her?
Wanna make her all your own?

Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina, Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights

I've seen this thing before
In my best friend and the boy next door

Fool for love and full of fire
Won't come in from the rain
She's oceans running down the drain

Blue as ice and desire
Don't you wanna make her?

Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina, Ave Maria

A million and one candle lights
Ooh, don't you wanna break her?

Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?
She walks like she don't care
Walkin' on imported air

Ooh, it makes you wanna die
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina, Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind

28,2Pac,Changes,1999,"Come on, come on
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch

Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare

First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead

I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers

And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, that's the way it is

Come on, come on, that's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah

Come on, come on, that's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted

Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other

And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks

But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you

You gotta operate the easy way
I made a G today, but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kid, I gotta get paid
Well hey, well, that's the way it is

Come on, come on, that's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah

Come on, come on, that's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survivem

And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me

And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do
But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimps smack you up

You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops, they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool?
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
Rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
Some things will never change"
29,R Kelly,If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time,1999,"How did I ever let you slip away?
Never knowing, I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin', you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine

Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Oh why, oh why should one have to go on suffering?
When every day I pray, please come back to me

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you, you'd be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin', you still be mine

And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong I admit I did
But now, I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you, you'd be mine, whao
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin', you still be mine

Oh, I'd never hurt you
  (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong
  (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side
  (If I could turn back the hands)
Turn back the hands

There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you

Forever honest and true to you
  (If I could turn back)
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you

That would be my will

Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands

I'm going down, yes I am
  (If I could turn back)
Down on my bended knee, yeah
  (If I could turn back)
And I'm gonna be right there, until you return to me
  (If I could turn back the hands)

  (If I could turn back)
Just turn back that little clock on the wall
  (If I could turn back)
Then I'd come to realize how much, I love you
  (If I could turn back the hands)

  (If I could turn back)
Love you
  (If I could turn back)
Love you
  (If I could turn back the hands)

31,Smash Mouth,All Star,1999,"Somebody once told me
The world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense
Not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do
So much to see

So what's wrong with taking the back street
You'll never know if you don't go

You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now
You're an all star
Get your game on
Go play

Hey now
You're a rock Star
Get the show on
Get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place
And they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now
Wait 'til you get older
But the media men
Beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate

Is getting pretty thin
The waters getting warm
So you might as well swim
My world's on fire

How about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now

Could you spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep

What a concept
I could use
A little fuel myself

And we could all use a little change
Well the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.

The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead

I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up the rain was pourin' down
There were people standin' all around
Something warm flowing through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night

I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I had missed

Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life, that night
Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world"

Friday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out, but you came home around three.
Now if six of ya'll went out
Then four of you were really cheap.
Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt.

Hook It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway.
Pack your bags up and leave.
And don't you dare come
Running back to me.

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

Verse 2

I'm packing bags so you can leave town for a week
The phone rings then you look at me (why'd you turn and look at me)
You said it was one of your friends from over 54th street
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID.
I've been through all this before
So how could you think.
That I would stand around
And take some more
Things are gonna change.
Cause I won't be a fool anymore
That's why you have to leave.
So don't turn around to see my face
Cause there's no more tears
Left here for you to see.

Verse 3

Now is it really worth you going out like that
See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back
See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for me
It turns out, you were making a fool of me.

on my fingertips, have to say is even better.
Then I never thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life...

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long.
Waiting for tonight.

Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never.
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever.
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on...

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long.

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms.

Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may I can never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best, when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd

What's been said between your heart and mine

For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day

I need some distraction
Oh beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear

You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack

It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness
Oh this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear

You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

49,Len,Steal My Sunshine,1999,"I was lying on the grass
On Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self defeats
My mind was thugged
All laced and bugged
All twisted round and beat
Uncomfortable three feet deep

Now the fuzzy stare from not being there
On a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar-speak
And of course you can't become
If you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

I was frying on the bench slide
In the park across the street
L A T E R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws
Out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight foot heap

Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tear
In a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among
But I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me

Making sure I'm not in too deep

Keeping versed and on my feet

To tell you baby face to face

Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me, look what you did to me

I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me, can't take what you did to me

Played me all along and made a fool of me, baby

65,Baz Luhrmann,Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen),1999,"Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of '99
Wear Sunscreen
If I could offer you only one tip for the future,
Sunscreen would be it
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists
whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience…
I will dispense this advice now...

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth
oh nevermind;
you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded
But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself
and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before
you and how fabulous you really looked…

You are not as fat as you imagine
Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as
effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that
never crossed your worried mind

the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday

Do one thing everyday that scares you

Sing
Don't be reckless with other people's hearts

don't put up with people who are reckless with yours

Floss
Don't waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind…

the race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself
Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults

if you succeed in doing this, tell me how

Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements

Stretch
Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life…
the most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't

Get plenty of calcium
Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone
Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding
anniversary…
what ever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either
your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's

Enjoy your body

use it every way you can…

don't be afraid of it, or what other people think of it

it's the greatest instrument you'll ever own

Dance…even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room
Read the directions, even if you don't follow them
Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
Be nice to your siblings
they are the best link to your past
and the people most likely to stick with you in the future

Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on
Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle

because the older you get
the more you need the people you knew when you were young
Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard
live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft
Travel
Accept certain inalienable truths
prices will rise
politicians will philander
you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young
prices were reasonable
politicians were noble
and children respected their elders
Respect your elders
Don't expect anyone else to support you
Maybe you have a trust fund
maybe you have a wealthy spouse
but you never know when either one might run out
Don't mess too much with your hair
or by the time you're 40, it will look 85
Be careful whose advice you buy, but
be patient with those who supply it
Advice is a form of nostalgia
dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off
painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth
But trust me on the sunscreen"
66,Shawn Mullins,Lullaby,1999,"She grew up with the children of the stars
In the Hollywood hills and the Boulevard
Her parents threw big parties everyone was there
They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper
Bob Seeger and Sonny and Cher

And she feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage I can tell that she can't let go and she can't relax
And just before she hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby
I sing

Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Rockabye

She still lives with her Mom outside the city
Down that street about a half a mile
And all her friends tell her
She's so pretty

But she'd be a whole lot prettier
If she smiled once in a while
'Cause even her smile looks like a frown
And she's seen her share of devils in this angel town

Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye, rockabye

I told her I ain't so sure about this place
It's hard to play a gig in this town
Keep a straight face
And seems like everybody's got a plan
It's kind of like Nashville with a tan

Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
So rockabye, rockabye

Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye

Everything's gonna be all right

Can you repeat that, tryin' to take my man
See I don't need that, so don't play yourself

68,Mariah Carey,I Still Believe,1999,"No, oh, no
Yeah, yeah, oh

You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy, but you still can touch my heart
And after all this time you think that I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing and nothing's changed

I still believe, someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream, someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life, I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I, I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp, I'd hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning, to have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together, no, no, no
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

I still believe, someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again, oh, baby, yeah, yeah
I had a dream you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
(Ooh, baby, I do)
Someday you and me
(Just give me one more try)
In love again

I had a dream
(I miss your love)
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe, someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again"
69,Geri Halliwell,Look At Me,1999,"Good looking, bad tasting
Full bodied, butt wasted
Loose living, tight fitting
What you see ain't what you are getting

Big make up, little break up
She wants it, he's got it
Cold blooded, hot gossip
Superficial expectations

Look at me, you can take it all
Because this face is free
Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me
I'm a drama queen if that's your thing
Baby, I can even do reality

Fake honey, real plastic
Stupid cupid, fantastic
Queer thinking, straight talking
What you see ain't what you are getting

Fast loving, slow moving
No rhythm but I'm grooving
Old feeling, new beginning
Superficial expectations

Look at me, you can take it all
Because this face is free
Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me
I'm a drama queen if that's your thing
Baby, I can even do reality

That's me
Ha, ha, ha, ha

Sometimes I don't recognize my own face
I look inside my eyes and find disgrace
My little white lies tell a story
I see it all, it has no glory

Look at me, you can take it all
Because this face is free
Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me
I'm a drama queen if that's your thing
Baby, I can even do reality

Come on and look at me
This face is free, I'm your fantasy
So who'd you wanna be, not what you see
I'm a drama queen if that's your thing
Come on and look at me, I'm your fantasy
This face is free"
70,P Diddy & ,Satisfy You,1999,"All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain, girl
Caress your frame, get them worries off your brain, girl
I'm in your corner do what you want it's your thing, girl
Oppositess attract, but we one in the same, girl it ain't a game

So I can't play with you, wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times we'll always make it through
'Cause what we got is true no matter what they say to you

I can straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be the voice of reason when you ain't tryin' hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it

Sit her on the sofa get a little closer
Touch it right, do it like a man's supposed to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose ya
'Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten

I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
'Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else

Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together and they tried yet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet

Hold you, mold you, drink no liquor, show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you

Don't let him sing you a sad song, no baby
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

I'm the light when you can't see, I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me

When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected

I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there 'cause I could hold it down for you

Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, 'cause I simply adore you

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you"

Time passed away
And I just can't get you off my mind
Nobody knows, I hide it inside
I keep on searching but I can't find

The courage to show to letting you know
I've never felt so much love before

And once again I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out
But if I let you go I will never know

What my life would be holding you close to me
Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah)
How will I know if I let you go?
Night after night I hear myself say
Why can't this feeling just fade away?

There's no one like you (No one like you)
You speak to my heart (Speak to my heart)

It's such a shame we're worlds apart
I'm too shy to ask, I'm too proud to lose but sooner or later I gotta choose

And once again I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out
But if I let you go I will never know
What my life would be holding you close to me

Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah)

Over the trees, subways and cars
I'd try to find out who you really are

In the middle of the night
Cool, sweatin' in my bed
Got the windows open wide
Thinkin' about all the things you said

I wish I could fly out in the blue
Over this town followin' you
I'd fly over rooftops, the great boulevards
To try to find out who you really are, who you really are

I wish I could fly now
I wish I could fly now
I wish I could fly now

I wish I could fly around and around
Over this town, the dirt on the ground
I'd follow your course of doors left ajar
To try to find out who you really are, who you really are

I'd fly and fly and fly, I wish I could fly
I wake up in a dream in the middle of the night

Anything goes, when I give it to you
Without a doubt, I'll turn you out
The feeling is fine, giving you everything of mine

I'm the place to be
And soon, you'll see
I don't care who leads
As long, as we, move horizontally

88,TQ,Westside,1999,"This is going out, to the whole wide westside...
Know what I'm sayin?
Break it down for me.
Steadily mobbin,
rock rock on.

I was just the young boy,
Living in the hove city.
East Side Compton G
Back in the days when Ice Cube and Eazy
Had every nigga talkin bout
Boy you can't fuck with me
Remember Ice-T had the power
hearing gunshots licking by the hour.
When Too short bumping every super spot
And told us all how to ride for the West Coast

To my peoples if you with me where you at
Throw your dubs in the air,
and wave 'em like you just don't care
From L.A. to the Bay, what you say, all day every day any damn day
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down, going on an on
It don't stop, won't stop, can't stop, nigga ride or die.
That's why I put it down for the West side

Didn't seem that long ago, (oh no)
We was stealing 40s out the liquor sto (oh no)
Mama started tripping so it's time to go
Mob to the front with the locstaz
Everybody broke smoking roaches
DJ Quick was the shit, had every nigga clamin he was 4rm
the C-P-T
Y'all remember, Onetime tried to clown
We had to burn this bitch on down

One time for my niggaz in incarceration,
I blaze a dime with you, for having lotsa patience
Two times for my sisters at the county buildin
I got some West Side love for all you ghetto children
Three times for my niggaz that done passed away,
I tip some Gin for you, and pray for better days.
One day everything's gonna be fine,
but until that day my only reply, Is West Side till I die

It don't stop, won't stop, can't stop, nigga ride or die.
Got to give it up for the West side

From Crenshaw to Foothill Boulevard
All I see is lowlows and mob cars, datins and five stars
All the true hoes is hitting switches
With all the finest riches.
Of course the finest bitches, don't get it twisted.
Ask me what's a real G? Show me a nigga scrappin
back against the wall until his knuckles bleed.
Screaming death to all our enemies, and those who don't believe.
West Coast living be the shit to me.

One time for my niggas in incarceration,
I blaze a dime with you, for having lotza patience
Two times for my sisters at the county buildin
I got love for all your little ghetto children
Three times for my niggas that done passed away,
I tip some Gin for you, and pray for better days.

89,Sting,Brand New Day,1999,"How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair?
And how many times did you swear
That you'd never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights?
How many lies, how many fights?
And why would you want to
Put yourself through all of that again?

Love is pain I hear you say
Love is a cruel and bitter way of
Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?

You never want to feel so sad and lost again

One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
Or you could be walking down the street

And who should you chance to meet?
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?

Why don't we turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day

Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way

Turn the clock to zero sister
You'll never know how much I missed her

I'm starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero boss
The rivers wide we'll swim across
We're starting up a brand new day

It could happen to you
Just like it happened to me
There is simply no immunity
There's no guarantee

I say love is such a force if you find yourself in it
You need some time for reflection
You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money

We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero Mack
I'm begging her to take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero boss
The river's wide we'll swim across

We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero buddy
Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy
We're Starting up a brand new day
I'm the rhythm in your tune
I'm the sun and you're the moon

I'm the bat and you're the cave
You're the beach and I'm the wave
I'm the plough and you're the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station
I'm the flagpole to your nation
I'm the present to your future
You're the wound and I'm the suture
You're the magnet to my pole
I'm the devil in your soul
You're the pupil I'm the teacher
You're the church and I'm the preacher
You're the flower I'm the rain
You're the tunnel I'm the train
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted, every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day
You're the crop to my rotation
You're the sum of my equation
I'm the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
We'll go up instead of down
You're the pan and I'm the handle
You're the flame and I'm the candle
I'm the bee and your the flower
You're the princess in the tower
I'm the mast and your the sail
I'm the hammer your the nail)
Stand up, all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted, every boy and every girl
Stand up, all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day"

the hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange
he asks a man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes
get a job you fucking slob is all he replied.

God forbid you ever had to walk mile in his shoes

Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love
he said don't worry 'bout a thing baby doll, I'm the man you've been dreamin' of
but three months later he say he wont date her or return her calls
and she swear 'god damn if I find that man Im cutting off his balls'
then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walking through the door
they call her a killer and they call her a sinner and they call her a whore

I've seen a loser win and a sad man grin, I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad and the down side of up and everything between
I licked the silver spoon, drank from the golden cup and smoked the finest green
I Stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times before I broke their hearts
you know where it is yo, it usually depends on where you start.

I knew this kid Max
He used to get fast stacks out on the corner with drugs
he liked to hang out late at night, liked to get shit faced and keep pace with thugs
Until late one night there was a big gunfight
Max lost his head
he pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit and wound up dead
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all his pain
you know it crumbles that way, at least that's what they say when you play the game.
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
'cause then you really might know whats its like to have to lose
and then you really might know what its like (what its like)

Every beautiful melody of devotion every night 
It's potion like this ocean that might carry me 
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me 
And every word, every second, and every third 
Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard 
And when I play them, every chord is a poem 
Telling the Lord how grateful I am cos I know him 
The harmonies possess a sensation similar to your caress 
If you asking then I'm telling you it's yes 
Stand in love, take my hand in love, God bless

What of all the things that you taught me?
What of all the things that you'd say?
What of all your prophetic preaching
You're just throwin' it all away?

Maybe we should burn the house down
Have ourselves another fight
Leave the cobwebs in the closet
'Cause tearin' them out is just not right

97,Sugar Ray,Someday,1999,"Someday
When my life has passed me by
I lay around and wonder why
You were always there for me

One way
In the eyes of a passerby
I look around for another try
And fade away

Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me

Some say
Better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say
You were always there for me

Someway
When the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time
And fade away
And fade away

Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me

Someone said you tried too long
Someone said we got it all
Someone said we tried too long
Is there a place where I belong?

So far and so long
So far away
So far and so wrong
So far away, away, away

Some day
When my life has passed me by
I lay around and wonder why
You were always there for me

One way
In the eyes of a passerby
I look around for another try
And fade away

And fade away
And fade away
And fade away

98,Boyzone,You Needed Me,1999,"You needed me

I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you, I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave? I'd be a fool
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares
You needed me

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

You needed me, you needed me
Oh, guess you needed me, you needed me"

100,Geri Halliwell,Mi Chico Latino,1999,"DÃ³nde estÃ¡ el hombre
Con fuego en la sangre?

I've got a secret, I cannot keep it
It's just a whisper of a distant memory
Just a dream or so it seems
Take me back to the place I'd rather be

You left a fire in my eyes
That lightens up the darkest skies
I'm giving up, I'm letting go
I'll find my way so

Take me back to my sweet la vida
Find my love, my dolce vita
Show me where I need to go
DÃ³nde estÃ¡ mi chico latino?

Stolen moments, time has broken
My eyes are open to this life-long mystery
And so I'll go with what I know
Take my chances and run with destiny

Now there's fire in my eyes
I break away and say goodbye
I'm free to be, I'm letting go
I'll find my way so

Take me back to my sweet la vida
Find my love, my dolce vita
Show me where I need to go
DÃ³nde estÃ¡ mi chico latino?

Que sueÃ±o, dulce y pequeÃ±o
Yo no sÃ©, yo no sÃ©
Pero no es un cuento
Mi corazon con tormento

Chico latino te quiero
O simplemente deseo
Yo lo sÃ© el camino
Es un sueÃ±o latino

Take me back to my sweet la vida
Find my love, my dulce vita
Show me where I need to go
