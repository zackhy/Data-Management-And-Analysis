Kung Fu Fighting
Oh-oh-oh-oh...

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting, those jerks were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit fright'ning, but they fought with expert timing

There was funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were trapping when up, they were trapping when down
It's an ancient Chinese art, and everybody knew their part
For my friend, ain't you a stiff, then I'm kickin' from the hip

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting, those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit fright'ning, but they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billie Jim and little Sammy John
He said, here comes the big boss, let's get it on
We took the bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me stiff, now we're into a brandnew trip

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting, those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit fright'ning, but they did it with expert timing

Oh-oh-oh-oh...

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting, those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit fright'ning, make sure you have expert timing

Kung Fu fighting, had to be fast as lightning..."
2,Terry Jacks,Seasons in the Sun,1974,"Goodbye Emil, my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and A, B, C's
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees

Goodbye Emil, it's hard to die
When all the bird's are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
I wish we could both be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills we could climb
Were just seasons out of time

Goodbye Papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to show me right from wrong
But too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along

Goodbye Papa, it's hard to die
When all the bird's are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little kids are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons have all gone

Goodbye Francoise, my trusted wife
Without you I'd had a lonely life
You cheated lots of times with them
But I forgave you in the end
Though your lover was my friend

Goodbye Francoise, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With your lovers everywhere
Just be careful, I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach

Goodbye Michelle, my little one
You gave me joy and helped me find the sun
And every time when I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground"

6,Barbra Streisand,The Way We Were,1974,"Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were

Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me would we, could we

Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget

So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were"

As we fell into the sun

Seeing no one else had come
And a bell was ringing in the village square

Began to settle down.
In the town they're searching for us everywhere
But we never will be found

Will search for evermore
For the band on the run

11,Paper Lace,The Night Chicago Died,1974,"Daddy was a cop
On the east side of chicago
Back in the usa
Back in the bad old days

In the heat of a summer night
In the land of the dollar bill
When the town of chicago died
And they talk about it still

When a man named al capone
Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
Against the forces of the law

I heard my momma cry
I heard her pray the night chicago died
Brother, what a night it really was
Brother, what a fight it really was
Glory be
I heard my momma cry
I heard her pray the night chicago died
Brother, what a night the people saw
Brother, what a fight the people saw
Yes, indeed
And the sound of the battle rang

Through the streets of the old east side
'til the last of the hoodlum gang
Had surrendered up or died
There was shouting in the street

And the sound of running feet
And i asked someone who said
'bout a hundred cops are dead
I heard my momma cry

I heard her pray the night chicago died

Brother, what a night it really was
Brother, what a fight it really was
Glory be

I heard my momma cry
I heard her pray the night chicago died
Brother, what a night the people saw
Brother, what a fight the people saw

Yes, indeed
Then there was no sound at all
But the clock up on the wall
Then the door burst open wide
And my daddy stepped inside
And he kissed my momma's face
Then brushed her tears away
The night chicago died

I SHOT THE SHERIFF



by Bob Marley

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy.
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy.

All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down.
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy,
For the life of a deputy.
But I say:

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense.
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense.

Sheriff John Brown always hated me;
For what I don't know.
Every time that I plant a seed
He said, ""Kill it before it grows.""
He said, ""Kill it before it grows.""
I say:

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense.
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense.

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town.
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down.
So I shot, I shot him down.
I say:

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy.
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy.

Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be.
Every day the bucket goes to the well,
But one day the bottom will drop out,
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out.
But I say:

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy, oh no.
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy, oh no."

But the show must go on, go on and on
Cause, You're the entertainer, the entertainer
You're the entertainer, the entertainer, yeah

[Instrumental Interlude]

Now hear that applause, now you know you made the grade
You fooled them well, for the money they paid
Now walk off in style, and don't forget to smile
Though your heart tells you, ""frown"" you can't let the people down

Sure your one girl has gone, but you've got to walk on
When, You're the entertainer, tell yourself

Warmed by a stolen kiss
For I was lonely

Let me make your dreams come true
I'll sing my song
Let me make it warm for you

On his winged flight

Then come, and as we lay
Beside this sleepy glade
There I will sing to you

As deep as a river

Him love and affection
To keep him strong
Moving in the right direction

Just enough for the city, ee ha

Some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet
He barely makes a dollar

To scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe
She hardly gets a penny

But never are they dirty

Just enough for the city, um hum

Her brother's smart
He's got more sense than many
His patience's long
But soon he won't have any

Is like a haystack needle

But to him there's no solution

Living just enough
Just enough for the city
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I hope you hear
Inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you
To make a better tomorrow

This place is cruel
No where could be much colder
If we don't change
The world will soon be over

He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away

You know I'm gonna be like you""

""When you comin' home, Dad?""
""I don't know when, we'll get together then, son
You know we'll have a good time then""

Said, ""Thanks for the ball Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw?"" I said
""Not today, I got a lot to do"", he said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away but a smile never came

So much like a man I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?""
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please?""

Called him up just the other day
I said, ""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you Dad, it's been sure nice talking to you""

And as he hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like, my boy was just like me

His young and lovely fiancée
From where I stood I saw she was crying
And through her tears I heard her say

""Billy don't be a hero
Don't be a fool with your life.
Billy don't be a hero
Come back and make me your wife""
And as they started to go
She said ""keep your pretty head low""

The battle raging all around.
The sergeant cried we've got to hang on boys
We've got to hold this piece of ground.
I need a volunteer to ride up
And bring us back some extra men
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgetting all the words she said.
She said

""Billy don't be a hero
Don't be a fool with your life.
Billy don't be a hero
Come back and make me your wife""

I'd work day and night
To earn our daily bread
And every day Emma would go out
Searching for that play
That never, ever came her way
You know sometimes she'd come home
So depressed
I'd hear her crying in the back room
Feel so distressed
And I'd remember back when she was five
To the words that used to make
Emmaline come alive
It was :
""Emmaline,

To find her lying still and cold
Upon the bed
A love letter lying on the bedroom floor
It read :
""Darling I love you,
But I just can't keep on living on dreams no more.
I tried so very hard not to leave you alone.
I just can't keep on trying no more.""

And through her tears I heard her say

Billy don't be a hero, don't be a fool with your life
Billy don't be a hero, come back and make me your wife
And as Billy started to go, she said keep your pretty head low
Billy don't be a hero, come back to me

The soldier blues were trapped on a hillside
The battle ragin' all around
The sergeant cried, we've gotta hang on boys
We've gotta hold this piece of ground

I need a volunteer to ride out
And bring us back some extra men
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgettin' all the words she said, she said

Billy don't be a hero, don't be a fool with your life
Billy don't be a hero, come back and make me your wife
And as Billy started to go, she said keep your pretty head low
Billy don't be a hero, come back to me

I heard his fiancee got a letter
That told how Billy died that day
The letter said he was a hero
She should be proud he died that way
I heard she threw the letter away"

And how I would listen to the things you had to say.
I just break down, as I look around
and the only things I see
are emptiness and loneliness
and an unlit Christmas Tree.

It'll be lonely this Christmas

It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold.
It'll be cold so cold
without you to hold

We never thought there'd be an end
And I remember looking at you then
And I remember thinking that Christmas must have been made for us

When it means so very very much.

69,Helen Reddy,Angie Baby,1974,"You live your life in the songs you hear
On the rock and roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
that's a really nice place to go
Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you out of school
You're a little touched you know, Angie baby

Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your Daddy taps on your door
Angie girl, are you all right?
Tell the radio goodnight
All alone once more, Angie baby

Angie Baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe

Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At night through the window blind
I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today?
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie baby

When he walks in the room, he feels confused
Like he's walked into a play
And the music's so loud it spins him around
'Til his soul has lost it's way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound never to be found

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover
Who keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side, Angie baby

Angie Baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe, well, maybe, well maybe"
70,Charles Aznavour,She,1974,"She may be the face I can't forget
A trace of pleasure or regret
May be my treasure or
The price I have to pay.
She may be the song that summer sings
May be the chill that autumn brings
May be a hundred different things
Within the measure of a day.
She may be the beauty or the beast
May be the famine or the feast
May turn each day into a
Heaven or a hell.
She may be the mirror of my dream
A smile reflected in a stream
She may not be what she may seem
Inside her shell.
She who always seems so happy in a crowd
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud
No one's allowed to see them
When they cry.
She may be the love that cannot hope to last
May come to me from shadows of the past
That I remember till the day I die.
She may be the reason I survive
The why and wherefore I'm alive
The one I'll care for through the
Rough and rainy years.
Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears
And make them all my souvenirs
For where she goes I've got to be.
The meaning of my life is she, she, she."

83,Elton John,Candle in the Wind,1974,"Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all you had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork

And they whispered into your brain they set you on the treadmill and they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing (a-a-a-h...) who to cling to when the rain set in
I would (ah... ah-ah-ah) have liked to know you but I was just a kid

Your candle burned out
(ah-ah-ah-ah...) long before your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar and pain was the price you paid

Even when you died oh the press still hounded you all the papers had to say was that Marilyn was found in the nude
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing (a-a-a-h...) who to cling to when the rain set in

From the young man in the twenty second row
Who sees you (ooh-ooh-ooh...) as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
(ah-ah-ah-ah...) And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing (a-a-a-h...) who to cling to when the rain set in
I would (ah...) have liked to know you (ah-ah-ah...) but I was just a kid

That night down south between the trailer
Not the early one that you can wish upon
Not the northern one that guides in the sailors

Turn this crazy bird around
Should not have got on this flight tonight

You got the touch so gentle and sweet
But you've got that look so critical
Can't talk to you baby you know I get so weak
Sometimes I think love is just mythical

Up there's a heaven, down there's a town
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Blackness, blackness dragging me down
Come on light the candle in this heart of mine

Star bright, star bright
You've got the loving that I like
Turn this crazy bird around
Should not have got on this flight tonight

I'm drinking sweet champagne
Got the headphones up high
Can't numb you, can't drum you out of my mind
And singing, ""Goodbye baby, baby goodbye
Ooh, ooh, love is blind""

Up go the flaps down go the wheels
Hope you got your heat turned on baby
Hope they finally fixed your automobile
Hope it's better when we meet again, baby

A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified

Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play
Jazzman, oh Jazzman

When the Jazzman's signifyin' and the band is windin' low
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul

He can cry like a fallen Angel when the risin' time is near
