1,Irene Cara,Flashdance... What a Feeling,1983,"First when there's nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind

All alone, I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone

Well, I hear the music
Close my eyes, feel the rhythm
Wrap around, take a hold of my heart

What a feeling
Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life

Now I hear the music
Close my eyes, I am rhythm
In a flash, it takes hold of my heart

What a feeling, being's believing
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
Now I'm dancing through my life

What a feeling

What a feeling (I am music now)
Being's believing (I am rhythm now)
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life

What a feeling (I can really have it all)
Being's believing
(Pictures come alive when I call)
I can have it all (I can really have it all)
Have it all (pictures come alive when I call)
(Call, call, call, call, what a feeling)
I can have it all (being's believing)
Being's believing (take your passion)"
2,The Police,Every Breath You Take,1983,"Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby please...
(ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo)

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make

3,Michael Jackson,Billie Jean,1983,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said dont mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

2nd verse
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one

Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And dont go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love

And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Go dance on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice

(do think twice)
She told my baby, we'll dance till 3: 00
And she looked at me

Then showed a photo of a baby cries
his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
People always told me be careful of what you do
And dont go around breaking young girls hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of her sweet perfume

This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, she says he is my son
She says I am the one"
4,Culture Club,Karma Chameleon,1983,"There's the loving in your eyes all the way

5,Michael Jackson,Beat It,1983,"They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can

So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it

Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it

They're out to get you, better leave while you can

Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it

You have to show them that you're really not scared

You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight

6,David Bowie,Let's Dance,1983,"Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway
While colour lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run
I'll run with you
And if you say hide
We'll hide

Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance

Let's dance

For fear your grace should fall

Let's dance

For fear tonight is all

Let's sway

You could look into my eyes

Let's sway

Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

And if you say run
I'll run with you
And if you say hide
We'll hide

Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

7,Bonnie Tyler,Total Eclipse of the Heart,1983,"Turn around, every now and then
I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming round

Turn around, every now and then
I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
Turn around, every now and then

I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around, every now and then
I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes

Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight

We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna to start tonight
Forever's gonna to start tonight
Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark

Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line

Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna to start tonight

Forever's gonna to start tonight
Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
Turn around, bright eyes"

But don't play games with my affection
Take, take, take what you need
But don't leave me with no direction

All alone, I sit home by the phone
Waiting for you, baby
Through the years
How can you stand to hear
My pleading for you dear?
You know I'm crying ooh ooh ooh ooh

Go, go, go where you want
But don't leave me here forever
You, you, you stay away
So long girl, I see you never

What can I do
Girl to get through to you?
Cause I love you, baby
Standing here, baptisted in all my tears
Baby through the years
You know I'm crying ooh ooh ooh ooh

You never ever worry
And you never shed a tear
You saying that my love ain't real
Just look at my face
These tears ain't drying

You, you, you can never say
That I'm not the one who really loves you
I pray, pray, pray every day
That you'll see things, girl like I do

11,Nena,99 Red Balloons,1983,"You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons
With the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'Til one by one, they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message
""Something's out there""
Floating in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by

99 red balloons
Floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here
From somewhere else
The war machine springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
Where 99 red balloons go by

99 Decision Street
99 ministers meet
To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call the troops out in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it boys, this is war
The president is on the line
As 99 red balloons go by

99 Knights of the airway
Ride super-high-tech jet fighters
Everyone's a Silverhero
Everyone's a Captain Kirk
With orders to identify
To clarify and classify
Scramble in the summer sky
As 99 red balloons go by

As 99 red balloons go by

99 dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standin' pretty
In this dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenier
Just to prove the world was here
And here is a red balloon
I think of you and let it go."

13,Billy Joel,Uptown Girl,1983,"Uptown girl 
She's been living in her uptown world 
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy 
I bet her momma never told her why 

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl 
She's been living in her white bread world 
As long as anyone with hot blood can 
And now she's looking for a downtown man 
That's what I am 

And when she knows what 
She wants from her time 
And when she wakes up 
And makes up her mind 

She'll see I'm not so tough 
Just because 
I'm in love with an uptown girl 
You know I've seen her in her uptown world 
She's getting tired of her high class toys 
And all her presents from her uptown boys 
She's got a choice 

Uptown girl 
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls 
But maybe someday when my ship comes in 
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been 
And then I'll win 

And when she's walking 
She's looking so fine 
And when she's talking 
She'll say that she's mine 

She'll say I'm not so tough 
Just because 
I'm in love 
With an uptown girl 
She's been living in her white bread world 
As long as anyone with hot blood can 
And now she's looking for a downtown man 
That's what I am

She's my uptown girl 
You know I'm in love

Now I'm no longer sure
I wish I knew what I know now before

I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever

Just when I thought that we were winning
You and I were so close in every way
Don't time fly when you're loving and laughing

I've said goodbye so many times
The situation ain't all that new
Optimism's my best defense
I'll get through without you

When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when

I won't be that dumb again
I know it's gotta last forever

Go your own way don't think twice about me
'Cause I've got ideas and plans of my own
So long darlin' I'll miss you believe me

There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby

The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Ohh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

16,Michael Sembello,Maniac,1983,"Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife, if the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

(crazy! crazy! crazy! crazy!)

On the ice-blue line of insanity is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery: touch it, but can't hold it.
You work all your life for that moment in time, it could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold kinetic heat, struggling, stretching for the beat
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know. And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know. And she's dancing like she's never danced before
It can cut you like a knife, if the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be
She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know And she's dancing like she's never danced before
Maniac, maniac, I sure know And she's dancing like she's never danced before"

19,Mike Oldfield,Moonlight Shadow,1983,"The last that ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through.
The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Four a.m. in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night
Far away on the other side.
Will you come to talk with me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five.
The night was heavy and the air was alive
But she couldn't find how to push through.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Carried away by a moonlight shadow."

Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart

All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh

Sail away with me to another world

Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever

Is to feel my strength, you know it's almost gone

For some tender arms
Hold me tight
I keep waiting

She's coming in, 12: 30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

What will it effect, when all is done

Go to rockets full, not responding

Turn the thrusters on, we're standing by

They don't realize, he's alive
No one understands but Major Tom sees

She's waiting for her clientele.

Twenty-eight years have come and gone.
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in.
They really seem to need her there.
It's a sacrifice working day to day.
For little money just tips for pay.
But it's worth it all just to hear them say that they care.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money.
So you better treat her right.

Already knows she's seen her bad times.
Already knows these are the good times.
She'll never sell out, she never will, not for a dollar bill.
She works hard

I shut my eyes and I fantasize,
That you're here with me,
Will you ever return?

I won't be you satisfied,
'Til you're by my side,
Don't wait any longer,
Why don't you come back?

Please hurry, why don't you come back?
Please hurry...
Come back and stay for good this time.
Come back and stay for good this time.
You said goodbye,

I was trying to hide what I felt inside,
Until you passed me by,
You said you'd return.
You said that you'd be mine,

'Til the end of time,
Don't wait any longer,
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry, why don't you come back?

Please hurry...

Come back and stay for good this time.
Come back and stay for good this time.
Since you've been gone,
Opened my eyes and I realize,

What we had together,
Will you ever return?
I'll have you change your mind,
If you won't stay mine just love me forever,

Love me forever.
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry, why don't you come back?
Please hurry, why don't you come back?
Please hurry, why don't you come back?
Please hurry, why don't you come back?

Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl

I could escape this feeling, with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing

I'm a mess without, my little China Girl
Wake up in the morning where's my little China Girl
I hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

I feel a tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
And I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl

I stumble into town, just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the whites of my eyes

My little China Girl you shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
Y'know, I'll give you television I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
""Oh baby just you shut your mouth""
She says, ""Sh sh shhh""
She says, ""Sh sh shhh""
She says, she says

And when I get excited my little China Girl says
""Oh baby just you shut your mouth""

She's a real nice girl

But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do 

Listen boy 
I'm sure that you think you got it all 
Under control 

You don't want somebody telling you 
The way to stay in someone's soul 

You're a big boy now 
You'll never let her go 
But that's just the kind of thing 
She ought to know 

Tell her about it 
Tell her everything you feel 
Give her every reason to accept 
That you're for real 

Tell her about it 
Tell her all your crazy dreams 
Let her know you need her 
Let her know how much she means 

Listen boy 
It's not automatically a certain guarantee 
To insure yourself 
You've got to provide communication constantly 

When you love someone 
You're always insecure 
And there's only one good way 
To reassure 

Tell her about it 
Let her know how much you care 
When she can't be with you 
Tell her you wish you were there 

Tell her about it 
Every day before you leave 
Pay her some attention 
Give her something to believe 

Cause now and then 
She'll get to worrying 
Just because you haven't spoken 
For so long 
Though you may not have done anything 
Will that be a consolation when she's gone 

Listen boy 
It's good information from a man 
Who's made mistakes 

Just a word or two that she gets from you 
Could be the difference that it makes 

She's a trusting soul 
She's put her trust in you 
But a girl like that won't tell you 
What you should do 

Tell her about it 
Tell her everything you feel 
Give her every reason 
To accept that you're for real 

Tell her about it 
Tell her all your crazy dreams 
Let her know you need her 
Let her know how much she means 

Tell her about it 
Tell her how you feel right now 
Tell her about it 
The girl don't want to wait too long 
You got to tell her about it 
Tell her now and you won't go wrong 
You got to tell her about it 
Before it gets too late 
You got to tell her about it

Done up in lace, done up in rubber
The John's are jerky little G.I. Joe's
On R&R; from Cuba and Russia
The smell of sex, the smell of suicide
All these dream things I can't keep inside

And careful notes
And antiquated notions [(what?!)]

To a sky filled up with diamonds
When I make love to you, tonight

And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us

And soon this old world will seem brand new

Tonight we will both discover how friends turn into lovers

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun
Are streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight

The beating of my heart is a drum, and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright, I've got to follow it

'Cause everything I know
Well, it's nothing till I give it to you, alright

I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle, at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock

And I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
I can make all your demons be gone

But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really want to see me crawl?
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

Turned the dark to day

Before the magic got away

We were running with the night
Playingin the shadows
Just you and i
Till the morning light
(we were running) oh, oh
Running with the night
You were looking so good girl
Heads were turning
You and me on the town
Ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us, we were running
We were gonna go all the way
And we never had a doubt

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and i
Till the morning light
Running with the night
We were so in love you and me
On the boulevard wild and free
Giving all we got, we laid it down
Taking every shot, we took the town

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and i

Girl, it was so right."

We eat and drink while tomorrow they die

To claim the victory Jesus won
On...

Some flicker of love that still shines through
Let's talk it out
Let's talk about second chances

Wait and see, it's gonna be sweeter than it was before
I gave some then but now I intend
To dedicate myself to giving more

Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go

92,Michael Jackson,Human Nature,1983,"Looking out across the night-time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out into the night-time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?

Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way, I like lovin' this way

Looking out across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, why, why? Ooh, tell 'em
Why, why does he do me that way?

93,The Kinks,Come Dancing,1983,"They put a parking lot on a piece of land
Where the supermarket used to stand
Before that they put up a bowling alley

On the site that used to be the local palais
That's where the big bands used to come and play
My sister went there on a Saturday

Come dancing
All her boyfriends used to come and call
Why not come dancing, it's only natural?

Another Saturday, another date
She would be ready but she'd always make 'em wait
In the hallway, in anticipation

He didn't know the night would end up in frustration
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek

Come dancing,
That's how they did it when I was just a kid
And when they said come dancing, my sister always did

My sister should have come in at midnight
And my mom would always sit up and wait
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late

Out of my window
I can see them in the moonlight
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate

The day they knocked down the palais
My sister stood and cried
The day they knocked down the palais
Part of my childhood died, just died

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band
And there's a car park where the pale used to stand
My sister's married and she lives on an estate

Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait
She knows they get away with things she never could
But if I asked her I wonder if she would

Come dancing
Come on sister, have yourself a ball
Don't be afraid to come dancing, it's only natural

Come dancing, just like the palais on a Saturday
And all her friends will come dancing
Where the big bands used to play"

Comes from living close to your fears

Leads to shock miss a beat

Bigger the harder he falls but when the wrong antidote
Is like a bulge on the throat you run for cover in the heat

Why don't they do what they say, say what they mean
