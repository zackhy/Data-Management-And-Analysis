1,OutKast,Hey Ya!,2003,"One two three go

My baby don't mess around me
'Cause she loves me so
And this I know for sure
Uh, but does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door?

Don't try to fight the feelin'
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
Uh, thank God for Mom and Dad for sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how

Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it, til' there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better, when there's feelings involved

If what they say is ""Nothing is forever""
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes, love exception
So why you, why you, why you, why you, why you
Are we so in denial? When you know we're not happy here
Y'all don't wanna hear me you just wanna dance
  (Hey ya, hey ya)

Don't want to meet your daddy
  (Hey ya, hey ya)
Just want you in my caddy
  (Hey ya, hey ya)

Don't want to meet your momma
  (Hey ya, hey ya)
Just want to make you cumma
  (Hey ya, hey ya)
I'm, I'm, I'm just being honest
  (Hey ya, hey ya)
I'm just being honest

""Hey, alright now, alright now fellows""?
""Yeah""
""Now what's cooler than bein' cool?""
""Ice cold""
""I can't hear ya, I say what's cooler than bein' cool?""
""Ice cold""

Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

""Okay now, ladies"", ""Yeah""
""Now we gonna break this thang down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothin'
Now I wanna see y'all on y'all baddest behavior
Lend me some suga', I am your neighbour
Ahh! Here we go""

Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake, shake it
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake
Shake, shake it, like a polaroid picture, hey ya
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, suga
Shake it like a polaroid picture

Now while Beyonces and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
Get on the floor, you know what to do
You know, what to do, you know I do

Go, shorty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday!

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck
But, homie, ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cut, that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit' a few shells, but I don't walk wit' a limp (I'm ight)
In the hood, in L.A, they saying ""50 you hot""
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla, in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm full of focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex I, ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

My flow, my show brought me the doe
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels

Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't change
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my jaws get to bumpin' in the club it's on
I wink my eye at you, bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me 'cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
Or we go upside they head wit' a bottle of bub

They know where we fuckin' be
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love

3,The Black Eyed Peas,Where is the Love?,2003,"What's wrong with the world, mama
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love)

Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love

It just ain't the same, all ways are changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
So I can ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the love, y'all(come on yeah)

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
Or would you turn the other cheek

Father, Father, Father help us
Send us some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love)

Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images, is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality
Instead in spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found (now ask yourself)

Where is the love
Where is the love
Where is the love
Where is the love

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love

Sing with my ya'll
(One world, one world)
We only got
(One world, one world)
That's all we got
(One world, one world)
And somethin's wrong wit it
(Yeah)
Somethin's wrong wit it
(Yeah)
Somethin's wrong with the w-w-world yeah
We only got

That's all we got

I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this,

All The Things She Said
All the things she said
All the things she said
Running through my head
All the things she said
All the things she said
Running through my head 
This is not enough

I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost
If I'm asking for help it's only because
Being with you has opened my eyes
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?

I keep asking myself, wondering how
I keep closing my eyes but I can't block you out
Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me
Nobody else so we can be free

All the things she said
All the things she said
Running through my head
All the things she said
All the things she said
Running through my head 
This is not enough
This is not enough

All the things she said
All the things she said

And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
They say it's my fault but I want her so much
Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain
Come in over my face, wash away all the shame
When they stop and stare - don't worry me
'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me
I can try to pretend, I can try to forget
But it's driving me mad, going out of my head

Mother looking at me
Tell me what do you see?
Yes, I've lost my mind

Daddy looking at me
Will I ever be free?
Have I crossed the line?"

7,Evanescence,Bring Me to Life,2003,"How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark

(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark

(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch, without your love
Darling, only you are the life among the dead

All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything

Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here (there must be something more)
Bring me to life

(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark

8,Christina Aguilera,Beautiful,2003,"Don't look at me

Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, feel so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Tryin' hard to fill the emptiness, the piece is gone
Left the puzzle undone, ain't that the way it is?

'Cause you are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do
(No matter what we say)
No matter what we say
(We're the song that's outta tune)
(Full of beautiful mistakes)

(And everywhere we go)
And everywhere we go
(The sun will always shine)
The sun will always, always shine!
  (But tomorrow we might awake on the other side)

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, oh no
We are beautiful in every single way

9,Dido,White Flag,2003,"I know you think that I shouldn't still love you
or tell you that.
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
where's the sense in that?
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder

Or return to where we were
But I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
I know I left too much mess and

destruction to come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of it's over
then I'm sure that makes sense
But I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
And when we meet

Which I'm sure we will
All that was then
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on...
I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door

Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home

A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singing

16,Madonna,American Life,2003,"Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

I tried to be a boy,
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess,
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong,
That's why I wrote this song

This type of modern life - Is it for me?
This type of modern life - Is it for free?
So, I went into a bar looking for sympathy
A little company - I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said it's always been the same
This type of modern life -Is not for me?
This type of modern life -Is not for free?

American life
I live the american dream
You are the best thing I've seen,
You are not just a dream

I tried to stay ahead,
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part,
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life - Is it for me?
This type of modern life - Is it for free?

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

American life
I live the american dream
You are the best thing I've seen,
You are not just a dream

I tried to be a boy,
I tried to be a girl

I tried to be a mess,
I tried to be the best
I tried to find a friend,
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top...

Fuck it...
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

I'm drinking a Soy latte
I get a double shot
It goes right through my body
And you know
I'm satisfied,
I drive my mini cooper
And I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo they tell I'm a trooper
And you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates
And the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies
And you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysic's shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing Is what it seems

Do I have to change my name
Am I gonna be a star
Do I have to change my name
Am I gonna be a star?
Do I have to change my name"

Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have

Time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

The nights I've waited up for you
Oh, boy
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you

It makes a cat nervous the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creeping all over town
I thought my tender touch could lock you down
I knew I had you as cocky as it sounds
The way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you're angry come here I'll prove it now, come here

Go ahead and do your thing now

A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
I'm gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talkin' to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette
And the message comin' from my eyes says, ""Leave it alone.""
Don't wanna hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
And if I catch it comin' back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
That ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
And the feeling coming from my bones says, ""Find a home.""
I'm going to Witchita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding right before the lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more
And the stains comin' from my blood tell me, ""Go back home."""

34,Eminem,Sing For the Moment,2003,"These ideas are nightmares for white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearin'
Its so scary in a house that allows no swearin'
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone cold and he don't care
He's a problem child what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
'Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants two rags and a stockin' cap
His step father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose this house is a broken home
There's no control he just lets his emotions go
(C'mon)

Sing with me

Sing for the year

Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
(C'mon)
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is danger intertwine it with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Only you're unholy only have one homey
Only this gun lonely 'cuz don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
Or they can be great or even worse they can teach hate
Its like kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you attorney's all gonna turn it to
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
You need to spew don't hesitate to produce air guns
Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Swiftly just to get me off these streets quickly
But all their kids been listen to me religiously
So I'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me
They're for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense, Pete
It's all political if my music is literal and I'm a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you

Sing with me
(Sing)
Sing for the year
(Sing)
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
(C'mon)
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
But can it load a gun for you and cock it too?
Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cos they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
We're entertainers of course this shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
It's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishin' they die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cos we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on through out lyrics that you hear in our songs
And we can

Sing with me

Sing for the year

Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear

Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Well I thought I knew you
Thinking that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff
Time is up, 'cause I've had enough

You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mmm hmm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that
I hold resentment for you
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong

That you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Turn out to be unjust so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth

Disguise yourself through
Living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me

If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?
I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true

58,Johnny Cash,Hurt,2003,"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

Broken branches trip me as I speak

There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck

Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster

A little melody is spinning on my mind tonight
I gotcha it's the song about chihuahua

Feels young - when you think about tomorrow
Say yo - when you're about to freak out
Just go, and then shout it out loud

Verse 2:
I'm driving in my car looking for a parking space
There it is my place, someone else wins the race
No, I give up, today is not my day
but then I take a deep breath and say
Calm down - when you're about to go crazy
Turn around - and feel as fresh as a daisy
Just run - because it's time to go
Have fun, and let the whole world know ( Chihuahua )

Young girl, it'Â€Â s alright
Your tears will dry, you'Â€Â ll soon be free to fly
Ooh

When you'Â€Â re safe inside your room, you tend to dream
Of a place where nothing'Â€Â s harder than it seems
No one ever wants or bothers to explain
Of the heartache life can bring and what it means

When there'Â€Â s no one else, look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within
Then you'Â€Â ll find the strength that will guide your way
You'Â€Â ll learn to begin to trust the voice within

Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed
It'Â€Â s so hard to stand your ground when you'Â€Â re so afraid
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
When you look outside, look inside to your soul

When there'Â€Â s no one else, look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within
Then you'Â€Â ll find the strength that will guide your way
If you will learn to begin to trust the voice within

Oh, ho, yea

69,Girls Aloud,Sound of the Underground,2003,"[Verse 1]
Disco dancing with the lights down low
Beats are pumping on the stereo
Neighbours banging on the bathroom wall
Sayin 'crank the bass, I gotta get some more'

Water's running in the wrong direction
Got a feeling it's a mixed-up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Something funny's going on inside my mind
I don't know what is pushing me higher
It's the static from the floor below
Then its drops and catches like fire
It's the sound I, it's the sound I know

[Chorus]
It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and around
In to the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet light
The beat goes around and round
Its the sound of the under, sound of the underground

[Verse 2]
Chain reaction running through my veins
Pumps the bass line up into my brain
Screws my mind until I lose control
And when the building rocks I know its got my soul

Water's running in the wrong direction
Got a feeling it's a mixed-up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Something funny's going on inside my mind
I don't know what is pushing me higher
It's the static from the floor below
Then its drops and catches like fire
It's the sound I, it's the sound I know

[Chorus]
It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and around
In to the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet light
The beat goes around and round
Its the sound of the under, sound of the underground

I don't know what is pushing me higher
It's the static from the floor below
Then its drops and catches like fire
It's the sound I, it's the sound I
It's the sound I, it's the sound I know

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and around
In to the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet light
The beat goes around and round
Its the sound of the under, sound of the underground

The bass line jumps in the backstreet light
It's the sound of the under, sound of the underground
The bass line jumps in the backstreet light

So sweet, so beautiful
Everyday like a queen on her throne
No, nobody knows how she feels
Aicha, Lady one day it'll be real
She moves, she moves like a breeze
I swear I can't get her out my dreams
To have her shining right here by my side
I'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes, oh
Aicha Aicha, passing me by
Aicha Aicha, my my my
Aicha Aicha, smile for me now
Aicha Aicha, in my life
She holds her child to her heart
Makes her feel like she blessed from above
Falls asleep underneath her sweet tears
Her lullaby fades away with his fears

Aicha Aicha, passing me by

Aicha Aicha, my my my
Needs somebody to lean on, lean on
Someone body, mind and soul, body, mind and soul
To take her hand, to take her world
Show her the time of her life, so true
Throw the pain away for good
No more contemplating, contemplating
No more contemplating
Lord knows the way she feels
Everyday in His name she begins
To have her shining here by my side
Sacrifice all them tears in my eyes, oh

You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it

you want love?
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again... I'll use my hands)

Damn baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine, all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes
Your body is a wonderland

And your old black hat ('Cause I wanna)

You could act real tough (If you wanna)
You could say you're torn
But I've heard enough
Thank you, you made my mind up for me when you started to ignore me

Do you see a single tear?
It isn't gonna happen here
At least not today, not today, not today
'Cause if it's over let it go and
Come tomorrow it will seem so yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away

Laugh it off and let it go and
When you wake up it will seem so yesterday, so yesterday
Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay
If you're over me, I'm already over you

If it's all been done, what is left to do
How can you hang up if the line is dead
If you wanna walk, I'm a step ahead
If you're moving on, I'm already gone

If the light is off then it isn't on
At least not today, not today, not today 'cause
If it's over let it go and
Come tomorrow it will seem so yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away

There's no way we're gonna give up

And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said

Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say

There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control
Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe"
93,The Dixie Chicks,Landslide,2003,"I took my love
And I took it down
I climbed a mountain
And I turned around
And I saw my reflection
in a snow covered hill
Well the Landslide brought me down

Oh mirror in the sky what is love
Can a child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

Uh ah ... uh ah ... uh ah ...
uh ah ... uh ah ...uh ah...

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older too
Well...

(Instrumental)

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I build my life around you
But time makes bolder
Well Children get older
I'm getting older too

Well, I'm getting older too

So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a Mountain and ya turn around
And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide brought me down

And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills

Well maybe... Well maybe... Well maybe

Landslide will bring you down."
94,Annie Lennox,Into The West,2003,"Lay down, your sweet and weary head
Night's falling, you've come to journeys end

Sleep now, and dream of the ones who came before
They are calling from across a distant shore

Why do you weep?
What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see all of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms, you're only sleeping

What can you see on the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea a pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn to silver glass
A light on the water, all souls pass

Hope fades, into the world of night
Through shadows falling out of memory and time

Don't say, we have come now to the end
White shores are calling
You and I will meet again
And you'll be here in my arms, just sleeping

What can you see on the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea a pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn to silver glass
A light on the water, gray ships pass into the west"
95,Red Hot Chili Peppers,Fortune Faded,2003,"They say in chess you've got to kill the queen and then you made it
Oh why - do you?

A funny thing the king who gets himself assasinated
Hey now, every time I lose - altitude

You took a town by storm the mess you made was nominated
Oh I - Do you?

Now put away your welcome, soon you'll find you've over stayed it
Hey now, every time I lose - altitude

So divine, hell of an elevator, all the while my fortune faded
Never Mind, the consequences of the crime this time my fortune's faded

The medicated state of mind you've found is over rated
Oh I - Do you?

You saw it all come down and now its time to imitate it
Hey now, every time I lose - altitude

So divine, hell of an elevator, all the while my fortune faded
Never Mind, the consequences of the crime this time my fortune's faded

Come on god, do I seem bullet proof...

So divine, hell of an elevator, all the while my fortune faded
Never Mind, the consequences of the crime this time's my fortune's faded

So divine, hell of an elevator, all the while my fortune faded
Never Mind, the consequences of the crime this time's my fortune's faded"
96,Delta Goodrem,Born to Try,2003,"Doing everything that I believe in
Going by the rules that I've been taught
More understanding of what's around me
And protected from the walls of love

All that you see is me
And all I truly believe

That I was born to try
I've learned to love
Be understanding
And believe in life
But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like

But I was born to try

No point in talking what you should have been
And regretting the things that went on
Life's full of mistakes, destinies and fate
Remove the clouds look at the bigger picture

And all that you see is me
And all I truly believe

That I was born to try
I've learned to love
Be understanding
And believe in life
But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like

But I was born to try

All that you see is me
All I truly believe
All that you see is me
And all I truly believe

That I was born to try

I've learned to love
Be understanding
And believe in life
But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like

But I was born to try

But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like

But I was born to try"
97,Will Young,Leave Right Now,2003,"I'm here
Just like I said
Though its breaking every rule I've ever made
My racin' heart
Is just the same
Why make it strong to break it once again?

And I'd love to say I do
Give everything to you
But I can never now be true
So I say

I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me out
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now

I'm here
So please explain
Why you're openin' up a healin' wound again
I'm a little more careful
Perhaps it shows
But if I lose the highs, at least I'm spared the lows

Now I tremble in your arms
What could be the harm
To feel my spirit calm
So I say

I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
I'm feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me out
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now

I wouldn't know how to say
How good it feels seeing you today
I see you've got your smile back
Now you say your right on track

But you may never know why
Once bitten twice is shy
If I'm proud perhaps I should explain
I couldn't bear to lose you again

I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me out
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Yes I will

I think I'd better leave right now
I'm feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me out
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now"
98,Clay Aiken,Bridge Over Troubled Water,2003,"When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
Oh when times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on Silver Girl,
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
oh if you need a friend
Look around
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Oh like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Ease your mind"
99,Seal,Love's Divine,2003,"There the rainstorm came over me
And I felt my spirit, break
I had lost, all of my, belief, you see
And realized my, mistake
But time, threw a prayer, to me
And all around me, became still

I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me now I see that I've been blind
Give me love
Love is what I need to help me know my name

Through the rainstorm came, sanctuary
And I felt my spirit, fly
I had found, all my, reality
I realize what, it takes

'Cause I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me now I see that I've been blind
Give me love
Love is what I need to help me know my name

Oh I, don't bend, don't break
Show me how to live and promise me
You won't forsake
'Cause love can help me know, my name

Well, I tried to say there's nothing wrong
When inside I felt me lying all along
But the message here was plain to see
""Believe me""

'Cause I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me now I see that I've been blind
Give me love
Love is what I need to help me know my name

Oh I, don't bend, don't break
Show me how to live and promise me
You won't forsake
'Cause love can help me know, my name
Love can help me know, my name"
100,Jennifer Lopez,I'm Glad,2003,"Baby, when I think about the day that we first met
