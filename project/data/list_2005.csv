1,Madonna,Hung Up,2005,"Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Ring ring ring goes the telephone
The lights are on but there's no one home
Tick tick tock it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day
But it'll be too late

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing, every little thing
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, waiting for your call
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

So slowly, so slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do

3,James Blunt,You're Beautiful,2005,"My life is brilliant

My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that l'm sure

She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye
As we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again but
We shared a moment that will last 'till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"

They got to have one good girl who's always been there like,
took all the bullshit

then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave

I woke up in the middle of the night
and I noticed my girl wasn't by my side,

could sworn I was dreaming,
for her I was feening,
so I had a take a little ride,
back tracking of these few years,
trying to figure out what I do to make it go bad,

where you would get up and run
and I would be out chasing you

than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely

5,Mariah Carey,We Belong Together,2005,"I didn't mean it when I said
I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed
I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting
Here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you
Guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here,'cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please,'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep(too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And its' breakin' my heart
I'm tryin' to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, crying tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please,'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please,'cause
We belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together"
6,Daniel Powter,Bad Day,2005,"Where is the moment we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away

And I don't need no carryin' on
You stand in the line just ahead of the law
You're faking a smile with the coffee you go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces everytime

And I don't need no carryin' on
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day

You had a bad day
Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say

And I don't need no carryin' on
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind

You had a bad day

(Oh. Holiday.)
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong

And I'm not wrong

So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day"
7,Green Day,Boulevard of Broken Dreams,2005,"I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
""What's fucked up?"" and ""Everything's all right""
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone"
8,Kanye West,Gold Digger,2005,"She take my money when I'm in need

Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle

I break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a ******, I'll be a ******

On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into

Wanna show me how you work it baby? No problem, get on top
Then get your bounce around, like a little rider

Cause I ain't never put it down like this

As soon as I come through the door, she get to pulling on my zipper
It's like it's a race who could get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch you in ******?
Had me thinking 'bout that *** after I'm gone

I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on, or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow mo' on the floor when we grind

Long as she ain't stopping, homie I ain't stopping
Dripping wet with sweat, man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on

15,Coldplay,Speed of Sound,2005,"How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like
Where to? Where do I go?
If you've never tried then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll stop before I can stop
Or before I see things the right way up
All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ideas that you'll never find
Or the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Or Japan and China, all lit up

The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me
All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it then you'll understand
(Drums and guitar)
All those signs I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent, ooh
Birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it then you'll understand"

I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, I can't shake it, no

I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you'd leave
I was to damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything

But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps playin' in my head
Over and over again playin' in my head
Over and over again

Oh, but I think she's leavin'
Aw man, she's leavin'
I don't know what else to do
I can't go on not lovin' you

'Coz it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad

Yeah 'coz it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, I can't shake it, no

Now that I that realize that I'm going down
From all this pain you put me through
Every time I close my eyes, I lock it down
Ohh, I can't go on not lovin' you

'Coz it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad

Let the sun illuminate the words

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin

No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips

Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

Sometimes my tries
Are outside the lines

No man could test me, impress me
My cash flow would never ever end
Cause I'd have all the money in the world
If I was a wealthy girl

Think what that money could bring
I'd buy everything
Clean out Vivienne Westwood
In my Galliano gown
No, wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me first class
To my fancy house in London town

All the riches baby, won't mean anything

Inspire me and they'd come to my rescue
I'd dress them wicked, I'd give them names

I rock the fetish people you know who I am

I hope you can all keep up
We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top
Now we ain't getting nothing but love

That you'll always be this way?
Show me how you feel

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list

And I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

Now it's hard for me
With my heart still on the mend
Open up to me
Like you do your girlfriends

And you sing to me and it's harmony
Girl, what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything just to get you back again
Why can't we just try?

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list

I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

What if I was good to you? What if you were good to me?
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me?
What if it was paradise? And what if we were symphonies?
What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you?

Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I've broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hanging out
They said somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how if feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh God I

I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
So hard to leave it

If I could I relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it

You don't have to always be right
Let me take some of the punches

I'm sick of it all
Can you hear me when I sing?
You're the reason I sing
You're the reason why the opera is in me

Hey now
Still gotta let you know
A house does not make a home
Don't leave me here alone

And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you that makes it hard to let go

Sometimes you can't make it on your own"

Who are you to tell me if it's black or white?

Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived a lie, it's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away

Ooh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life

Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

Take a look around you, nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Anybody brave enough to take a stand
I knocked on every door down every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness and what's left to believe?

Ooh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life

46,Eminem,Like Toy Soldiers,2005,"Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers

Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win

But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless
I absolutely have to I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja crap I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth

While he's all over TV yeah I'm talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it I understand this is business

And this shit just isn't none of my business

But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left

We all fall down like toy soldiers

Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme

And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated 'cuz once you put someone's kids in it
The shlit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Mean while my attention is pullin' in another direction
Some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cuz one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that mother fucker can get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is

To have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't try'na have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at your jaws well then I can 'cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cuz
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers"

From the beginnin' to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

Used to see five-oh throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with five-oh, it's all startin' to make sense
My ma's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz

Waitin' on shop money to lamp, sittin' in the Range
Thinkin' how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
'Pac is gone and Brenda still throwin' babies in the garbage

I wanna know 'What's Goin' On' like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Bank had got that abortion? I love you, ma

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop

And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and remanence thinkin' of bliss of the good days
I stop and stare at the younger my heart goes to em
Aids tested it was stress that they under

And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth
'Cuz the truth look strange and for me it's reversed
We left them a world that's cursed and it hurts

'Cuz any day they'll push the button and all good men
Like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Told 'em they could get teary the world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly

There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me it ain't about black or white

And over there there's a lady crack got her crazy
Yet she's givin' birth to a baby

I don't trip and let it fade me from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged wonder if they take it all back
Will I still keep the courage?

I refuse to be a role model I set goals, stay in control
Drink out my own bottles I made mistakes
But learned from every one and when it's said and done
I bet this brother be a better one

If I upset you don't stress never forget
That God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain when I write rhymes
I go blind and let the Lord do His thing

But am I less holy 'cuz I chose to puff a blunt
And drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace we gotta find peace
And end the war in the streets my Ghetto Gospel

Opened up and let you in

And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door

And still you said your love was gone and that I had to leave

But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip

You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad
Even when you smile
Even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes
Deep inside, you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared
I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying
Wipe them tears
Daddy's here
No more nightmares
We gonna pull together through it
We gon' do it
Laney, uncle's crazy ain't he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins
When it swirls
When it whirls
When it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Looking puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move
Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it
But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
The more it backfires on me
All the things, growing up
As daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way
Your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when was teenagers
But then of course
Everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something
We have no control over
And that's what destiny is
But no more worries
Rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up
And this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Mama's gonna be alright

It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christamas presents up
And stuck them under the tree
And said some of them were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause daddy felt like a bum
See daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom

And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was saving money
For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you
So you can go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars
'Till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguing a lot
So mama moved back on the Chalmers in the flat
One bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me
But daddy had to work
You and mama had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it
And you and Laney were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone
Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'
Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown
It's almost like your sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are
And daddy's still here
Laney I'm talking to you too
Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
I told ya daddy's here to hold ya
Through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise
Mama's gonna be alright
And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdy's neck
I'll go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat
Don't fuck with dad, haha"

I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea.
You've built a love but that love falls apart.
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark.

Listen to your heart
when he's calling for you.
Listen to your heart
there's nothing else you can do.
I don't know where you're going
and I don't know why,
but listen to your heart
before you tell him goodbye.

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile.
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea.
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems,
the feeling of belonging to your dreams.

Listen to your heart
when he's calling for you.
Listen to your heart
there's nothing else you can do.
I don't know where you're going
and I don't know why,
but listen to your heart
before you tell him goodbye.

And there are voices
that want to be heard.
So much to mention
but you can't find the words.
The scent of magic,
the beauty that's been
when love was wilder than the wind.

Listen to your heart
when he's calling for you.
Listen to your heart
there's nothing else you can do.
I don't know where you're going
and I don't know why,
but listen to your heart
before you tell him goodbye.

I gotta shake it off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere

I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give

Boy I gotta shake, shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means
I gotta shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
'Cause I'll be on my way

See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say, ""I told you so""

Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

I gotta shake it off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games

Shake, shake, shake shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake shake, shake it off

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was

Hold up, my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind

You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
'Cause I need a real love in my life

Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

I gotta shake you off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games

74,Kanye West,Diamonds From Sierra Leone,2005,"Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)

Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz

It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them

What more can you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plastic - they still say Kane

Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&R;'s lookin' like ""pssh we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)"
75,Carrie Underwood,Inside Your Heaven,2005,"I've been down, now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you I'm alive

You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch
When we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone

Naturally
My soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way

And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
(And I wanna be inside in your heaven)
I wanna be inside
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven"
76,Jack Johnson,"Sitting, Waiting, Wishing",2005,"Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs

Lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the Lord no I'm just a fool
And a loving somebody don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

I sang your songs, I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
Putting up with them wasn't worth never having you

Aw, maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you

I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery

Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down
Just wait a minute

Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting

Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why it had taken me so long

But Lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
Because waiting on love ain't so easy to do

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool, fool"

I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song

Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it

Oh don't mind me I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him

85,John Legend,Ordinary People,2005,"Girl I'm in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday

I know i misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
This time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing everyday
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss then we make up on the way

I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I Still want you to stay

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
This time we'll take it slow

Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
We never know baby you and I

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Heyyy)
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
This time we'll take it slow"

A million people I
Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

And I’ve been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
“I’m fine baby, how are you?”
Well I would send them but I know that it’s just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another aeroplane
Another sunny place
I’m lucky, I know
But I wanna go home
Mmmm, I’ve got to go home

Let me go home
I’m just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like I’m living someone else’s life
It’s like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
This was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Another winter day has come
And gone away
In either Paris or Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home

And I’m surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
And let me go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

I gotta go home

And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin bout you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossing turning in my bed
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me
weep...
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby...

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

Now I know you're not my lady but I'm just trying to make this right
I don't know what to do I'm going out of my mind
So baby if u let me could I get you to say maybe we could ride together
We could do this all night now I don't care if u got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
Cause I know he can't love u right, quite like I can
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me
weep...
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

I love the way u freaky like that
I love the way u freaky like that
I love the way u freaky like that
It's an obsession

Hold up let me dream
Shorty got me feeling serene
Where my candy, where my cream
Got your boy feeling supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got a lot of money, I love to spend it
And that's whats up and I don't care what people scream
You're my blessing when I'm stressing
My superfly beauty queen
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Cause my money know how I do, we go rendez-vous, mi corazon belongs to you

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong) what am I do wrong Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
What am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong?) what am I do so wrong? Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)

When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I

And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you"

Oh chariot your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your
Strength

You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup,
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

Oh chariot your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your
Strength

Give me your strength
Chariot
Give me your strength
Chariot
Give me your strength
Chariot
Give me your strength
Chariot
Give me your (give it to me)
Chariot
Give me your (give it to me)
Chariot
Give me your strength(give it to me)
Chariot
Give me your strenght oh chariot"
98,John Mayer,Daughters,2005,"I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same shes been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do, yeah
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the god and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do, yeah
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
So mothers, be good to your daughters too"
