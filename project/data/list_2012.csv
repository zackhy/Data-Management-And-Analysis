1,Gotye & Kimbra,Somebody That I Used to Know,2012,"Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know)

I used to know
That I used to know
I used to know
Somebody"
2,Carly Rae Jepsen,Call Me Maybe,2012,"I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
and now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
but now you're in my way
Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you
and this is crazy
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
It's hard to look right
at you baby
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
Hey, I just met you
and this is crazy
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
And all the other boys
try to chase me
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
but still, you're in my way
I beg, and borrow and steal
Have foresight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
but it's in my way
Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you
and this is crazy
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
It's hard to look right
at you baby
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
Hey, I just met you
and this is crazy
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
And all the other boys
try to chase me
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad
It's hard to look right
at you baby
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
Hey, I just met you
and this is crazy
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?

3,fun.,We Are Young,2012,"Give me a second, I
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar and

I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know

I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now I know that I'm not all that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight

The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight

The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight"

7,Adele,Skyfall,2012,"This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
At Skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall
(Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles
(When it crumbles)
We will stand tall
(We will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
(Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles
(When it crumbles)
We will stand tall
(We will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall

(Let the sky fall)
(When it crumbles)
(We will stand tall)
(Let the sky fall)
(When it crumbles)
(We will stand tall)

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall
(Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles
(When it crumbles)
We will stand tall
(We will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
(Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles
(When it crumbles)

15,Taylor Swift,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,2012,"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)

Then you come around again and say, ""Baby
I miss you, and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you"" We break up, you call me, ""I love you""

Ooh, we called it off again last night, but ooh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me
Falling for it screaming that I'm right and you
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some
Indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight, but ooh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""

Uh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
I'm like, ""I just, I mean this is exhausting
You know, like we are never getting back together""
""Like, ever"" (No!)

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

We – getting back together

what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?

Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?

When I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible lies

Which way is right, which way is wrong?
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're headed separate ways

And it feels like I am just to close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more

Got to be true to myself

And it feels like I am just to close to love you
So I'll be on my way
You gave me more than I can return

Yet there's so much you deserve
Nothing to say, nothing to do
I've nothing to give
I must leave without you

You know were heading separate ways
And it feels like I am just to close to love you

I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself

30,Calvin Harris & Florence Welch,Sweet Nothing,2012,"You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper it's the worst emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing

And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold

When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing

When we both know that words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing!

Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to japan quake losers and survivors

Send my regards or regardless I get arrested

For one more chance to hold you close

We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing, and
Sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day in the week in the middle of the month In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November now December's almost gone
I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong, I don't know

I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat

I don't know where you're going
Just get your ass back home

And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coup but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck - cause they be swallowin' it

Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat

No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this
We'll be alright, trust that
We put the ""us"" in ""trust"" baby, let's go!

As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

That's where I have to go

And listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation

I know that much is understood
And I realise
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out, and I sit down at a table set for two

And finally I'm forced to face the truth

No matter what I say I'm
Not over you
Not over you
Damn, damn girl you do it well
and I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell

but still your magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me

I turn around and I'm back in the game
even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you
If you ask me how I'm doing

I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out, and I sit down at a table set for two

And finally I'm forced to face the truth

No matter what I say I'm
Not over you
And if I had the chance to re-new
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do

I could get back, on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring

You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground"

How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?

All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer

I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Beauty in all she is

I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you

Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me

The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not
And who I am

I'm giving you all my love

Durch das Gedränge, der Menschenmenge
Bahnen wir uns den altbekannten Weg
Entlang der Gassen, zu den Rheinterrassen
Über die Brücken, bis hin zu der Musik
Wo alles laut ist, wo alle drauf sind, um durchzudreh'n
Wo die Anderen warten, um mit uns zu starten, und abzugeh'n

An Tagen wie diesen, wünscht man sich Unendlichkeit
An Tagen wie diesen, haben wir noch ewig Zeit
Wünsch ich mir Unendlichkeit

Das hier ist ewig,ewig für heute
Wir steh'n nicht still, für eine ganze Nacht
Komm ich trag dich,durch die Leute
Hab keine Angst, ich gebe auf dich Acht
Wir lassen uns treiben, tauchen unter, schwimmen mit dem Strom
Dreh'n unsere Kreise, kommen nicht mehr runter, sind schwerelos

An Tagen wie diesen, wünscht man sich Unendlichkeit
An Tagen wie diesen, haben wir noch ewig Zeit
In dieser Nacht der Nächte, die uns so viel verspricht
Erleben wir das Beste, kein Ende ist in Sicht

Kein Ende in Sicht
Kein Ende in Sicht
Kein Ende in Sicht

An Tagen wie diesen, wünscht man sich Unendlichkeit

86,Robbie Williams,Candy,2012,"I was there to witness, candices inner business
She wants the boys to notice her rainbows and her ponies
She was educated, but could not count to ten
Now she got lots of different horses by lots of different men
And I say: ""Liberate your sons and daughters""
The bush is high, but in the hole there's water
You can get some, when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

Hey ho, here she goes, either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo, cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey ho, here she goes, either a little too loud or a little too close
Got a hurricane at the back of her throat and she thinks she's made of candy
Ring a ring of roses, whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes as the war of the roses

Mother was a victim, father beat the system by moving bricks to Brixton and learning how to fix them
Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high, but in the hole there's water
""As you will"" shall be the whole of the law

And if it don't feel good what are you doing it for?
Now tell me
Hey ho, here she goes, either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo, cause she thinks she's made of candy

We've reached our climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to
Run away

We made our mess, what used to be love

At all

Love each other separately
I just need you one more time

I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around
I'm on my knees

88,Hugh Jackman,Suddenly,2012,"Suddenly you're here
Suddenly it starts
Can two anxious hearts beat as one?
Yesterday I was alone
Today you walk beside me
Something still unclear
Something not yet here has begun.

Suddenly the world
Seems a different place
Somehow full of grace, full of light.
How was I to know that so much hope was held inside me?
What has passed is gone
Now we journey on through the night

How was I to know at last that happiness can come so fast?
Trusting me the way you do
I’m so afraid of failing you
Just a child who cannot know that danger follows where I go
There are shadows everywhere
And memories I cannot share

Nevermore alone
Nevermore apart
You have warmed my heart like the sun.
You have brought the gift of life
And love so long denied me.

Suddenly I see
What I could not see
Something suddenly
Has begun."

Say my name

we are shining
and we will never be afraid again
Say my name
and every colour illuminates
we are shining
and we will never be afraid again
And we come for you
we'll be dressed up all in blue
with the ocean in my arms
kiss your eyes and kiss your palms

And when it's time to pray
we'll be dressed up all in grey
with metal on our tongues
and silver in our lungs

Say my name
and every colour illuminates
we are shining
and we'll never be afraid again
Say my name
as every colour illuminates
we are shining
and we'll never be afraid again
Say my name
and every colour illuminates
and we'll never be afraid again
And we come back
we'll be dressed in black
and you'll scream our names aloud
and we won't eat and we won't sleep
we'll drag bodies from their graves
Say my name
and every colour it illuminates
and we are shining
and we'll never be afraid again
Say my name
as every colour illuminates
Say my name
as every colour illuminates
we are shining

In the back room something I heard you say
We didn't wanna call it too early
Now it seems a world away but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day

You can see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts

Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

Just wakin up in the morning
And to be well
Quite honest with ya
I ain't really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train a thoughts been derailed?
That's when you press on- Lee nails
Half the population's just waitin to see me fail
Yeah right, you're better off tryina freeze hell
Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retails
But I do it for the kids, life threw the towel in on
Everytime you fall its only making your chin strong
And I'll be in your corner like Mick baby, til the end
Or when you hear the song from that big lady
Pre-Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do ya'll?
(Ryan Tedder):
Give em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live-life-til-we're-dead.
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter
Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me
Say to me, this one's a fighter
And if I can last thirty rounds
There's no reason you should ever have your head down
Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds
Hailing from rock bottom, loserville, nothing town
Text book version of the kid going nowhere fast
And now im yelling kiss my ass
it's gonna take a couple right hooks a few left jabs
for you to recognize that you really aint got it bad
Pre-Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do ya'll?

Everybody put yo hands up
What we gonna do? ya'll
If you fall pick yourself up off the floor (get up)
And when your bones can't take no more (c'mon)
Just remember what you're here for
Cuz I know imma damn sure
Give em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live- life- til- we're- dead.
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter

Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars

I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me:

Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it

Pour up (Drank) Head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank) Stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank) Wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank) Faded (Drank)

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch

Aw man... where is she taking me...
Where is she taking me...

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger, pain, that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom
Of a bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin'
Why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep
And never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't tripping
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ----'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, aye I see somebody
(Car door opens and gunshots are fired)
Aha! Got them niggas, K-dot, you good?
L----, you good?
Yeah blood, I'm good, Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say something - Dave?
These bitch ass niggas killed my brother!"

99,Toby Keith,Red Solo Cup,2012,"Now, red solo cup is the best receptical
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicals
If you prefer drinkin' from glass
Hey, red solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in fourteen years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddy, man, can kiss my ass

Whoo!
Red solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party

Let's have a party
I love you, red solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party
Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack

Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admirin' at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'

On them to help me get lucky
Red solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party

Let's have a party
I love you, red solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party

Proceed to party
Now, I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you, red, will do for this fellow

'Cause you are the Abbot to my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom
Red solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic

And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say
Red solo cup, you're not just a cup
(No! No! No! God, no!)

You're my-you're my (Friend?) friend
(Friend, friend, friend, Life-long)
Thank you for being my friend
Red solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party"
100,Hunter Hayes,Wanted,2012,"You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you want it too
'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
Anyone can tell you you're pretty and
You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
'Cause baby I wanna make you feel wanted
As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
Yeah, baby I wanna make you feel wanted
'Cause you'll always be wanted"
