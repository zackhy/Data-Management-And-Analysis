The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
be with myself and center clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

The path that I'm walking I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds

But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late and dark outside
I need to be with myself and center clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around and say

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But that's nothing new, yeah yeah

I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue
And you say sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late, whoa whoa

Can get in the way of what I feel for you

To find something like what we have

I know people will try, try to divide something so real

From my body I can show you a place, God knows

13,Plain White T's,Hey There Delilah,2007,"Hey there Delilah what's it like in New York City
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl tonight you look so pretty, yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you, I swear it's true

Hey there Delilah don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely give this song another listen
Close your eyes, listen to my voice it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard
But just believe me girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good, we'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away, I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall, we'd have it all

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way

Delilah I can promise you
That by the time that we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do

You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there Delilah here's to you
This one's for you

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me

16,The Fray,How to Save a Life,2007,"Step one, you say, ""We need to talk.""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down. It's just a talk.""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you

And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody

And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin'
I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake

They got they finger on the trigger, hands on their nines
See every day they feel the struggle, but stay on the grind
And ain't nobody take it from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know
There's a drop in the block
You move slow
You gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know, how not to lay low

She takes a loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose

35,Avril Lavigne,When You're Gone,2007,"I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd, I need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side
When you walk away I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
All the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do
When you walk away I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
And when you're gone

And when you're gone

To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were, yeah yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I'd do, I'd give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me, yeah

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you

Will always get me through the day
And make it okay

36,Beyonce,Listen,2007,"Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own all 'cause you won't
Listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened, there is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died so long ago
Oh, I'm screaming out and my dreams'll be heard
They will not be pushed aside on words

37,Jeff Buckley,Hallelujah,2007,"I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before, I knew you

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?

But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?

And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah"
38,U2,Window In The Skies,2007,"The shackles are undone, the bullets quit the gun
The heat that's in the sun will keep us when there's none

Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
What it's done to me?

Love makes strange enemies, makes love where love may please
The soul and its striptease, hate brought to its knees
The sky over our head, we can reach it from our bed
You let me in your heart and out of my head, head

Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
What it's done to me?

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Please don't ever let me out of you

I know I hurt you and I made you cry
Did everything but murder you and I

Love left a window in the skies

And I'm never gonna win

Quite the way I want it to be

(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house
On an episode of cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me

(So what do you need)

I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet

(been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on hollywood boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and
James Dean is fine for me

(So how you gonna do it)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
'cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the V.I.P. with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free
I think I'm gonna dress my ass
With the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to
Blow my money for me

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

Gonna pop my pills
From a pez dispenser
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sing em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

They say they like how I record
I gave you black train
And I did you wrong
So every time I see them
They tell me that's their song
They say I'm the bomb
They love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck
And compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear
Then comes the gear
So when I hit the room
The shorties stop and stare
Niggas start to hate
Rearrange their face
But little do they know
I keep them things by waist
'Side I reply
Nobody gotta die
Similar to lil wiz

She deserves you

Ignorance is bliss

And he's through with you

You'll die together but alone

At least you can predict this every year

If you don't say what's on your mind

Look at all that hair we had

Your phone is ringin' I don't wanna ask

If you go now, I'll understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan

With a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying ""I'm drunk""
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky

Right now, he's probably
Dabbing on three dollars
Worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

That I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires

Oh, you know it won't be on me!

Watch it burn, let it die
'Cause we are finally free, tonight

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side
We'll cry, but we won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young

77,Pink,Dear Mr President,2007,"Dear Mr. President
Come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people and
You're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly

What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why?

Dear Mr. President
Were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say
No child is left behind?
We're not dumb and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
Oh

How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?

You'd never take a walk with me
Would you?"

When I'm telling a story
And you find it boring
You're thinking of something to say
You'll go along with it then drop it
And humiliate me in front of our friends

Then I'll use that voice that you find annoying
And say something like
Yeah, intelligent input darling
Why don't you just have another beer then?
Then you'll call me a bitch
And everyone we're with will be embarrassed
And I won't give a shit

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation
And I know that I should let go but I can't
And every time we fight
I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset
And I smile
I know I should forget but I can't

You said I must eat so many lemons
'Cause I am so bitter
I said ""I'd rather be with your friends, mate
'Cause they are much fitter
Yes it was childish
And you got aggressive
And I must admit that I was a bit scared
But it gives me thrills to wind you up

The cracks in our foundation
And I know that I should let go but I can't
And every time we fight
I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset
And I smile
I know I should forget but I can't

Your face is pasty
'Cause you've gone and got so wasted
What a surprise
Don't want to look at your face
'Cause it's making me sick
You've gone and got sick on my trainers
I only got these yesterday
Oh my gosh, I cannot be bothered with this
Well I'll leave you there 'til the morning
And I purposely won't turn the heating on
And dear God, I hope I'm not stuck with this one

My fingertips are holding
Onto the cracks in our foundation
And I know that I should let go but I can't
And every time we fight
I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset
And I smile
I know I should forget but I can't

And every time we fight
I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset
And I smile

But it hurts when I think
When I let it sink in
It's all over me
I'm lying here, in the dark
I'm watching you sleep

it hurts a lot
And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me
I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up
Stay up 'til four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?

Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right
All I wanted was to know I'm safe
Don't wanna lose the love I've found
Remember when you said that you would change
Don't let me down
It's not fair how you are

I can't be complete
can you give me more
And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

Oh, please, you know what I need
Save all your lovin' for me

We can't escape the love
Give me everything that you have
And all I know is
You've got to give me everything

Now I wonder what my life is gonna mean if it's gone

The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour and I
Started staring at the passengers and waving goodbye
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?

But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come

Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

I think it turned ten o' clock, but I don't really know
And I can't remember caring for an hour or so
Started crying and I couldn't stop myself
I started running but there's nowhere to run to

I sat down on the street, took a look at myself
Said, ""Where you going man, you know the world is headed for hell?""
Say your goodbyes if you got someone you can say goodbye to

I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out

There's no one on the corner
And there's no one at home
Well it was cool cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me, and it's over for you

Well it's gone, gone, baby, it's all gone

I may not make it through the night

The noises that she made kept me awake, ohh
The weight of the things that remain unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us every day
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
thinking ""why does this happen to me?""

""Why does every moment have to be so hard?""

I should not ever let you go

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell,
It was love from above, that could save me from hell,
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see,
And the devil himself could be pulled out of me,
There were drums in the air as she started to dance,
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands,
And we sang...

2nd Verse
Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place,
You could tell how we felt from the look on our face,
She was spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes,
The room left them moving between you and I,
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time,
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night,
And we sang...

(Chorus)
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,
And the voices rang like the angels sing,
We`re singing..

97,Akon,Sorry Blame It On Me,2007,"As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occurred yet
And the things they don't want to take responsibility for

I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect

I'm sorry for the times I disrespect

I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like everyday
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say

Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

I understand that there are some problems
And I am not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show

If I can't apologize for being wrong

Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me

You can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me. Said you can put the blame on me, Said you can put the blame on me, Said you can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me

I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do

I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those packs
Just trying to stay busy till you heard from Dad
And you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though Pops treated us like kings

He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own

I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the FEDS came and took me away. I understand that there are some problems

And I am not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me. Said you can put the blame on me, Said you can put the blame on me, Said you can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
They were dead wrong trying to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl trying to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a 21 and older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame
Verizon backed out disgracing my name
I'm just a singer trying to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
Even though the blame's on you, I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me, You can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me"
98,The White Stripes,Icky Thump,2007,"Ya-eee! Icky thump, who'd a thunk?
Sittin' drunk on a wagon to Mexico
Ah well, what a chump, well my head
Got a bump when I hit it on the radio

Redhead seÃ±orita lookin' dead
Came and said, ""Need a bed?"" en espaÃ±ol
Said give me a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar
Well, I don't need a microphone

Icky thump with the lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat and I was freaking, I was ready to go
Yeah, I swear, beside the hair she had one white eye
One blank stare, lookin' up, lyin' there

On a stand near her hand was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane, dry ice, somethin' strange
La la la

White Americans, what, nothin' better to do?
Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too
Who's usin' who? What should we do?
Well you can't be a pimp and a prostitute too

Icky thump handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind, looked around and there was nobody else
Left alone I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how to clean up after myself"
99,Jennifer Lopez,Que Hiciste,2007,"Ayer los dos soÃ±abamos con un mundo perfecto
Ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
Porque en los ojos nos espiabamos el alma
Y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada

Ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero
Ayer tÃº me juraste que este amor serÃ­a eterno
Por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente
Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente

Â¿Que hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empaÃ±aste con tu furia mi mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Con un permiso para asi romperme el alma

Â¿Que hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

MaÃ±ana que amanezca un dia nuevo en mi universo
MaÃ±ana no verÃ© tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
No escucharÃ© palabras de arrepentimiento
IgnorarÃ© sin pena tu remordimiento

MaÃ±ana olvidarÃ© que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
MaÃ±ana ni siquiera habrÃ¡ razones para odiarte
Yo borrarÃ© todos tus sueÃ±os de mis sueÃ±os
Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos

Â¿Que hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empaÃ±aste con tu furia mi mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Con un permiso para asi romperme el alma

Â¿Que hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Con un permiso para asi romperme el alma

Â¿Que hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa"
100,Enrique Iglesias,Tired Of Being Sorry (Laisse le destin l'emporter),2007,"I don't know why
You want to follow me tonight
When in the rest of the world
With you whom I've crossed and I've quarreled
Let's me down so
For a thousand reasons that I know
To share forever the unrest
With all the demons I possess
Beneath the silver moon

Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry

8th and Ocean Drive
With all the vampires and their brides
We're all bloodless and blind
And longing for a life
Beyond the silver moon

Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry

I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon

So far away – so outer space
I've trashed myself – I've lost my way
I've got to get to you got to get to you

Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon
(lalalala till end)
Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon"
