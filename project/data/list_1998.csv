1,Celine Dion,My Heart Will Go On,1998,"Ev'ry night in my dreams, I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance and spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door and you're
Here in my heart and my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time and last for a
Lifetime and never let go till we're gone
Love, was when I loved you, one true time
I had to, in my life we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door and you're
Here in my heart and my heart will go on and on

You're here, there's nothing I fear, and I know
That my heart will go on. We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart and my heart will go on
And on"
2,Cher,Believe,1998,"No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one

Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think I'm strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough

What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you
Well I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
Cause I've got time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you

Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough

Well I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
No I don't need you anymore

Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough"
3,Aerosmith,I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,1998,"I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming

I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Ooh, every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing

Then I kiss your eyes
And thank God we're together
And I just want to stay with you in this moment forever
Forever and ever

I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

And I don't want to miss one smile
I don't want to miss one kiss
Well, I just want to be with you, right here with you
Just like this

I just want to hold you close
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all of the rest of time
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

Don't want to close my eyes
Don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you, babe

I don't want to fall asleep, yeah
I don't want to miss a thing"
4,Brandy & Monica,The Boy is Mine,1998,"The boy is mine Excuse me can I please talk to you for a minute?
Uh hu sure you know you look kinda familiar

Yeah you do too, but I just wanted to know
Do you know somebody named?
Oh you know his name
Oh yeah definitely I know his name

Well I just want to let you that he's mine
Huh no no he's mine
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine

I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
Think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face

There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane?
But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me

But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me

He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could

Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine

I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool

You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it's 'cause it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why

He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take

From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture
You're the past I'm the future

Get away it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine

I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine

I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow

The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart
He was my love right from the start
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine
You need to give it up, had about enough
It's not hard to see the boy is mine
I'm sorry that you seem to be confused
He belongs to me, the boy is mine"
5,Savage Garden,Truly Madly Deeply,1998,"I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy.
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love be everything that you need.
I love you more with every breath truly madly deeply do.
I will be strong I will be faithful 'cause I'm counting on a new beginning.
A reason for living. A deeper meaning. Yeah.

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea.
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me...

And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky
I'll make a wish send it to heaven and make you want to cry.
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty.
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of.
The highest powers. In lonely hours. The tears devour you.

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea.

6,Madonna,Frozen,1998,"You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen when your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open

Mmm, mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm, mmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm, mmm, give yourself to me
Mmm, mmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you my heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen when your heart's not open

Mmm, mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm, mmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm, mmm, give yourself to me
Mmm, mmm, you hold the key

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen when your heart's not open

If I could melt your heart"
7,Natalie Imbruglia,Torn,1998,"I thought, I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around and he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry

Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know
Seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

There's nothing where he used to lie
The conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light

It crawled beneath my veins
And now I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn, torn

There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on this floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late, I'm already torn, torn"
8,The Goo Goo Dolls,Iris,1998,"And i'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
'Cause sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am"

10,All Saints,Never Ever,1998,"A few questions that I need to know
How you could ever hurt me so?
I need to know what I've done wrong?
And how long it's been going on?
Was it that I never paid enough attention?
Or did I not give enough affection?
Not only will your answers keep me sane
But I'll know never to make the same mistake again
You can tell me to my face
Or even on the phone
You can write it in a letter
Either way I've have to know
Did I never treat you right?
Did I always start the fight?
Either way I'm going out of my mind
All the answers to my questions I have to find

My head's spinning boy, I'm in a daze
I feel isolated, don't wanna communicate
I take a shower, I will scour, I will roam
Find peace of mind, the happy mind I once owned, yeah

Flexing vocabulary runs right through me
The alphabet runs right from A to Z
Conversations, hesitations in my mind

I'm not crazy,  I'm sure I ain't done nothin' wrong, no

11,Shania Twain,You're Still the One,1998,"Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong

You're still the one I run to

12,Lauryn Hill,Doo Wop (That Thing),1998,"Yo, remember back on the boogie when cats used to harmonize like
Yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen, Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Come again

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

Girls you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing"
13,Jennifer Paige,Crush,1998,"Ahh crush ahh

See you blowin' me a kiss it doesn't take a scientist
To understand whats goin' on baby
If you see somethin' in my eye, let's not over analyze
Don't go too deep with it baby

So let it be, what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me
Here's what I do, I'll play the wuss
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint, every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like every thing I do, depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la

It's raisin' my adrenalin', you're bangin' on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it, baby
Say, ""That were for ever more""
That's not what I'm lookin' for all I can commit to is maybe

So let it be, what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me
Here's what I do, I'll play the wuss

It's just some little thing
Not like every thing I do, depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la

Vanilla skies
White picket fences in your eyes
A vision of you and me

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint, every time we touch

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Man, man look up at the sky
All the stars man, the stars look beautiful tonight
Look at em!

Chorus: Mya

Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin' from afar, reachin' for the stars
Run away with me, to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Pras]
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means
The supreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin' raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floatin' on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million refugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top skeezers
Diplomatic legalese, no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me, somethin' like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin' bygones be bygones and so on and so on
I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin' it retro-spective from the get-go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
P-Politic with ghetto senators on the deelow

Chorus

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
One two, and you don't stop, yo
My eyes are sore, bein' a senator
Behind closed doors hittin' truth to the seafloor
The rich go north ignore, the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So, I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal EVERYTHING, change the law
I find myself, walkin' the streets
Tryin' to find what's really goin' on in the streets

[Pras]
Yea, yo, yo, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away, that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around with fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin' ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yellin' !Ole!
Who the hell wanna' save me, from B.K., to Cali
Come on

Chorus

[Pras]
Yeah...yo, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losin' fast in the horse race
Two faced, gettin' defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Well I'm paranoid at the things I said
Wonderin' what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin' out
Partyin' with girls that never die, you see I was
Pickin' on the small fries, my campaign tellin' lies
Was just spreadin' my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holdin' the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now, in the hooooooooooooooooooooooooooood

Chorus

Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh

15,Mariah Carey,When You Believe,1998,"Many nights we pray
With no proof anyone could hear
And our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understand

Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long
Before we know we could

Oh yes, there can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill

Who knows what miracle
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away

And now I am standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill

Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fear, ohh
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way safe through the rain
Thought of a still resilient voice
Says love is very near

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill

Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will, how you will
You will when you believe

You will when you believe
Just believe
You will when you believe
Just believe
You will when you believe"

Give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Wheezey
Cream to the maximum I be askin' 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum
Never see Will attackin' 'em
I rather play ball with Shaq and 'em
Flatten 'em

Trust the lady of my life she hittin'
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon

Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

Back where I belong now, was it just a dream?
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold and the secret's safe with me
Hasta Manana, always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever for the moment
Ever searching for the one

28,Des'ree,Life,1998,"Mmm, yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah, yeah yeah
Oh life, oh life

I'm afraid of the dark
Especially when I'm in a park
And there's no one else around
Ooh, I get the shivers

I don't want to see a ghost
It's a sight that I fear most
I'd rather have a piece of toast
And watch the evening news

Doo, doo doo doo

Doo, doo doo doo

I'm a superstitious girl
I'm the worst in the world
Never walk under ladders
I keep a rabbit's tail

I'll take you up on a dare
Anytime, anywhere
Name the place, I'll be there
Bungee jumping, I don't care

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life

So after all is said and done
I know I'm not the only one
Life indeed can be fun
If you really want to

Sometimes living out your dreams
Ain't as easy as it seems
You wanna fly around the world
In a beautiful balloon

30,Celine Dion,I'm Your Angel,1998,"No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray

And then you will see, the morning will come
And everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears, cast them on me
I just want you to see

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel, I'm your angel

I saw your teardrops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way, let me show you a better day

And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears, just cast them on me
How can I make you see?

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel, I'm your angel

And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive

And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
Don't you dare give up the fight
Just put your trust beyond the sky

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are

I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me

Does an angel
Contemplate my fate?

The places where we go
When we're gray and old

That salvation
Lets their wings unfold

So when I'm lyin' in my bed
Thoughts runnin' through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

And through it all
She offers me protection
A love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

When I'm feelin' weak
And my pain walks down
A one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love

And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
An' when love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong

That ain't no release for me

Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine built to last
Slipped up there I guess we're running out of time too fast

38,Barenaked Ladies,One Week,1998,"It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said I'm angry
Five days since you laughed at me saying
Get that together come back and see me
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry

Hold it now and watch the hood wink
As I make you stop think
You'll think you're looking at aqua man
I summon fish to the dish although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the Sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like Wasabe when I bust rhymes
Big like Leann Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors

The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous
You'll have to sign a waiver

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

Threw your arms in the air and said you're crazy
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees

Like Sting I'm Tantric
Like snickers guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurasawa I make mad films
Okay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back swing
Gotta get in tune with sailor moon
'Cause the cartoon has got the boom Anime Babes
That make me think the wrong thing

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad

Can't understand what I mean?
Well, you soon will

Dropped your arms to your sides and said I'm sorry

You just did just what I thought you were gonna do

We realized we're both to blame
But what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me

We now had more important things to say
And when the car broke down they started walking
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?

And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and gray

They won't make it home but they really don't care
They wanted the highway they're happier there today, today

And heartache came to visit me

For someone must stand up for what's right
'Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing

But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own

They watch you pretend to adore me
But I'm no fool to this game

Until your guilt goes up in flames.

Even when you stay together
I don't need forever after, but it's your laughter won't let me go
So I'm holding on this way

Did you know could you tell you were the only one
That I ever loved?

Did you see me walking by, did it ever make you cry?

57,Bryan Adams,When You're Gone,1998,"{When you're gone}

I've been wanderin' around the house all night
Wondering what the hell to do
Yeah I'm trying to concentrate
But all I can think of is you oh

Well the phone don't ring
'Coz my friends ain't home
I'm tired of being all alone
Got the TV on 'coz the radio's playing
Songs that remind me of you

Baby when you're gone
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long

Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Baby when you're gone yeah

I've been driving up and down these streets
Trying to find somewhere to go
Yeah I'm lookin' for a familiar face
But there's no one I know

This is torture this is pain
It feels like I'm gonna go insane
I hope you're coming back real soon
'Coz I don't know what to do

Baby when you're gone
When you're gone
I realize I'm in love
The days go on and on on and on
And the nights just seem so long

Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Yeah baby when you're gone
Yeah when you're gone guy
Baby when you're gone
To go

Baby when you're gone, when you're gone
I realize I'm in love, just in love
The days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long

Even food don't taste that good, good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong, so wrong
Baby when you're gone, you're gone
Baby when you're gone
Baby when you're gone"
58,Smash Mouth,Walkin' On the Sun,1998,"It ain't no joke
I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey, I know it's just a song, but it's spice for the recipe

This is a love attack
I know it went out, but it's back
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with-it and hip
If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the Sun

Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened?

Then some were spellbound, some were hellbound
Some, they fell down and some got back up
And fought back against the meltdown
And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the Sun

It ain't no joke
When a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up
So choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't perform no god-like hocus-pocus

So don't sit back, kick back
And watch the world get bushwhacked
News at 10, your neighborhood is under attack
Put away the crack, before the crack puts you away
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the Sun
You might as well be walking on the Sun
You might as well be walking on the Sun
You might as well be walking on the Sun
You might as well be walking on the Sun..."

Symbol of my faith in who I am

And I won't let my heart control my head
But you are my only

I keep the memory of you and me inside

Fulfill your destiny
Is there within the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
The king of hearts, the joker's wild
But we don't say goodbye
I'll make them all remember me

Cos I have found a dream that must come true
Every ounce of me must see it though
But you are my only
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me

Immortality
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me, inside
And we don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
With all my love for you
And what else we may do
We don't say, goodbye"

From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death 'fore I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough?
Against wrong, choose right and be standin' up
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right
People drivin' all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your basinette

That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
'Cause I know I loved you more than life itself

Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you, uh

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

Five years old, bringing comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man a little me just like me
Wait an see gonna be tall makes me laugh 'cause
You got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be?
A General, a Doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line

Trudat uh uh uh why you do dat?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin' me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an' I don't mind if you lose
Long as you came with it an' you can cry, ain't no shame it it

It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove you was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back

Just the two of us
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky

You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin' times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me, I'm tryin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go

But yo, ain't nuthin' promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go wrong
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next son

Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams come true
I love you and I'm here for you, uh

As far back as I remember, the game¹s been played
Boy chace girl and Girl dissed da boy.
But there¹s only one exception to da rule
And that is loot and a whole big bag of it.
Now, I¹m speaking from experience,
And when you¹re broke you know you get no skiniens.
And if you lucky like Luciano, now here¹s my motto,
Lay it one by one and make sure it¹s legato.
Straight up macin in a rental, now see me smile.
My clothes are all from marshalls and I got my game tight.
And prayin¹ that the gold stays on my ring
And if not I¹ll spray that shit on, again.
It¹s all good, I learned how to roll with da punches
In order for me to get a little somethin¹-somethin¹.
It wasn¹t da bomb, but, Yo, I ain¹t complainin¹.
I thank the lord and so I cherish it, oh.
Cherish the love we have.
We should cherish the life we live.
Cherish the love, cherish the love, cherish the love.
Cherish the love we have for as long as we both shall live.
Cherish the love, cherish the love, cherish the love.
Oh, aha, yeah.
Nucky for this Biggie Bear Body
The game¹s alright, but this fellow got no kind of money.
So funny, cause I is broke as a joke,
But still I maintain to hold my own.
Selective, and checkin¹ my prospective, active,
And you all disreactin¹, negative,
Cause all I speek is the truth, all I need is a roof
And the rest is all good.
I¹ve played the Mac, but so does everybody else.
I¹m blessed with my family and my friends.
A chosen few in my life that I cherish
And you other ³playerhaters² better just venish.
I often pray before I lay down by your side.
If you received your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night.
I¹m telling you, man.
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live.
Cherish the love, cherish the love, cherish the love.
Cherish the love we have for as long as we both shall live.
Cherish the love, cherish the love, cherish the love.
Cherish the love we have.
We should cherish the life we live.

And Phil and Lil misses their mom and dad
So take the time of day
And we'll find the place
And I guarantee that we will all get home safe

Mya: Just Take me there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

82,The Cardigans,My Favourite Game,1998,"I don't know what your looking for
You haven't found it baby, that's for sure
You rip me up and spread me all around
In the dust of the dead of time
And this is not a case of lust, you see
It's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end it's always me alone

And I'm losing my favorite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby
Losing my favorite game

I only know what I've been working for
Another you so I could love you more
I really thought that I could take you there
But my experiment is not getting us anywhere

I had a vision I could turn you right
A stupid mission and a legal fight

I should have seen it when my hope was new
My heart is black and my body is blue
And I'm losing my favorite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my favorite game
You're losing your mind again

I'm losing my baby
Losing my favorite game
I'm losing my favorite game
You're losing your mind again
I've tried
I've tried
But you're still the same
I'm losing my baby
You're losing a savior and a saint"
83,Meja,All 'Bout The Money,1998,"Some times I find another world inside my mind
When I realize all the crazy things we do
It makes me feel ashamed to be alive
I wanna run away and hide

It's all about the money, it's all about the dum dum
And I don't think it's funny to see us fade away
It's all about the money, it's all about the
I think we got it all wrong anyway

Strange ways of showing how much we really care
When in face we don't seem to care at all
This pretty world is getting out of hand
So how come we fail to understand?

It's all about the money, it's all about the dum dum
And I don't think it's funny to see us fade away
It's all about the money, it's all about the

When the morning cries and you don't know why

Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone

First time I meet her, I wanted to greet her
Nobody could've been sweeter
I was wrong should have bought a bombita
But, now she gone
I don't know where she go
Me, I'm frustated down so, and the other men miss her
I guess I surely know that, baby
Where did she gone? where the rose bush rise up
Are you wicked than bandolero
Then a-better wise up
Or we go, ash to ash, and dust onto the dust
You just big up a chest and go loco

(repeat chours)

Smile up on the face
Make the next plan
Wiggle the bottom to attract the next man
Rude boys, beware
This one's a-come fe run the things
Swing them together
Like vendetta the gun things
She lick a shot, sa, to get
She take care of dha freak
And you get the money
Cause her punani popularity
Bum, bye-bye, she make a grown man cry
She just big up her chest and go loco

And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the peace in every eye

She had two babies, one was six months, one was three
In the war of '44
Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh, would her son grow to know his father?

I don't want to to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?

He showed up all wet on the rainy front step
Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw lives inside him still
It's so hard to be gentle and warm
The years pass by and now he has granddaughters

I don't want to to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?

You look at me from across the room
You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
So breathe a little more deeply my love
All we have is this very moment
And I don't want to do what his father
And his father, and his father did
I want to be here now
So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the love in every eye
I don't want to to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be

97,Matchbox Twenty,3AM,1998,"She said it's cold outside and she hands me my raincoat
She's always worried about things like that
She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault
And she only sleeps when it's raining
And she screams and her voice is straining

She says baby
It's 3 am I must be lonely
When she says baby
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

She's got a little bit of something, God it's better than nothing
And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all
She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to
And she only sleeps when it's raining
And she screams and her voice is straining

She says baby
It's 3 am I must be lonely
When she says baby
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway
But outside it's stopped raining

She says baby
It's 3 am I must be lonely
When she says baby
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

She says baby
It's 3 am I must be lonely
When she says baby
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes"
98,Sash! & Tina Cousins,Mysterious Times,1998,"Life, mysterious life
Where we're moving around, dancing the rhythm of life
And time, mysterious time
Where we're counting the hours and days to the end of our time

And we're feeling the change and we don't know why
Choose one direction just one more time
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind

And these are mysterious times
Mysterious times, no trick of the mind
For this moment I feel like we live in mysterious times
If you see what's behind, these are mysterious times

Soul, I feel my soul
For this moment nobody can stop me from flying so high
Real, nothing is real
In a world of illusion you only see what you feel

And we're feeling the change and we don't know why
Choose one direction just one more time
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind

And these are mysterious times
Mysterious times, no trick of the mind
For this moment I feel like we live in mysterious times
If you see what's behind, these are mysterious times
If you see what's behind, these are mysterious times"

Live On Two Legs
Given To Fly
Could have tuned in, tuned in, but he tuned out.
A bad time nothing could save him.
Alone in a corridor, waiting, locked out.
He got up out of there ran for hundreds of miles.
Made it to the ocean had a smoke in a tree.
The wind rose up set him down on his knee.

A wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw.
Deliver him wings, ""Hey, look at me now!""
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor.
Oh, now now, oh... He's flying whole. High. Wide. Oh...

Floated back down cause he wanted to share this key to the locks, on the chains, he saw everywhere.
But first he was stripped, and then he was stabbed, by faceless men.
Well fuckers, he still stands.
And he still gets his love he just gives it away.
The love he receives is the love that is saved.
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky.
A human being that was given to fly.
He's flying whole. High. Why? Oh-he's flying. Oh, he's whole. Oh..."
