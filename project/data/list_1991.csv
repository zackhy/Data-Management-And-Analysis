I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Don't compare!

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sewn when the going gets rough

I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the goin' gets mean

Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Alright, alright, oh
Ooh, ooh, alright
Yeah yeah yeah, now
Alright, alright, ooh ooh
Sh'mon, now
Yeah yeah yeah, now
Alright, ooh ooh

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white, ooh
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
Whoo!"
3,REM,Losing My Religion,1991,"Oh, Life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour I'm
Choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight, I'm
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
That was just a dream
Just a dream, just a dream
Dream

4,Roxette,Joyride,1991,"Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride
I hit the road out of nowhere

I had to jump in my car
And be a rider in a love game

Following the stars
Don't need no book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all
She has a train goin' downtown
She's got a club on the moon
But she's tellin' all her secrets

In a wonderful balloon
She's the heart of the fun fair
She's got me whistlin' her private tune
And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend
She says, ""Hello, you fool, I love you""

C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride
She's a flower, I can paint her

She's a child of the sun
We're a part of this together

Could never turn around and run
Don't need no fortune teller
To know where my lucky love belongs, oh no
'Cos it all begins again when it ends
(Yeah)
And we're all magic friends (magic friends, magic friends)

She says, ""Hello, you fool, I love you""
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride
She says, ""Hello, you fool, I love you""
C'mon join the joyride, be a joyride girl

I'll take you on a sky ride
A feelin' like you're spellbound

Sunshine is a lady
Who rocks you like a baby
She says, ""Hello, you fool, I love you""
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride
Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride
Hello, hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon, c'mon join the joyride, be a joyride girl

6,Extreme,More Than Words,1991,"Saying ""I love you""
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew how easy
It would be to show me how you feel

More than words
Is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real

What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying ""I love you""

More than words

Now but I've tried to talk to you
And make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands
And touch me
Hold me close, don't ever let me go

More than words
Is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real

What would you say if I took those words away
When you couldn't make things new
Just by saying ""I love you""

I follow the Moskva down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in and did you ever think
That we could be so close like brothers
The future's in the air I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

Walking down the street distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their

With you and me (ith you and me)
Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change (wind of change)

The wind of change blows straight into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say

Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night (glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)

I'm going to shoot through and leave you

Bringing out your higher self

Think of the fine times pushing down the better few

You know I don't see you when she walks in the room

It's no secret that a liar won't believe in anyone else

We're falling from the sky tonight

A man will beg
A man will crawl
On the sheer face of love
Like a fly on a wall
It's no secret at all

It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret, ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief

Oh love, we shine like a burning star
We're falling from the sky tonight

A man will rise
A man will fall
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all

Oh love, we shine like a burning star
We're falling from the sky tonight

Oh love, we shine like a burning star
We're falling from the sky tonight

A man will rise
A man will fall
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe exploded 'cause of one man's lie
Look, I gotta go, yeah, I'm running outta change
There's a lot of things if I could I'd rearrange"
17,The Simpsons,Do the Bartman,1991,"Yo, hey what's happening dude?
I'm a guy with a rep for bein' rude
Terrorizin' people wherever I go
It's not intentional, just keepin' the flow

Fixin' test scores to get the best scores
Droppin' banana peels all over the floor
I'm the kid that made delinquency an art
Last name, Simpson, first name, Bart

I'm here today to introduce the next phase
The next step in the big Bart craze
I got a dance, real easy to do
I learned it with no rhythm and so can you

So, move your body, if you got the notion
Front to back in a rock-like motion
Now that you got it, if you think you can
Do it to the music, that's the Bartman

Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman
Shake you body, turn it out, if you can, man
Move you butt to the side, yes, you can, can
Everybody in the house, do the Bartman

Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman
Shake you body, turn it out, if you can, man
Move you butt to the side, yes, you can, can
Everybody in the house, do the Bartman

It wasn't long ago, just a couple of weeks
I got in trouble, yeah, pretty deep
Homer was yellin', mom was, too
Because I put mothballs in the beef stew

Punishment time, in the air lurks gloom
Sittin' by myself, confined to my room
When all else fails, nothin' else left to do
I turn on the music, so I can feel the groove

Move your body, if you got the notion
Front to back in a rock-like motion
Move your hips from side to side now
Don't ya slip, let your feet glide now

If you've got the groove, you gotta use it
Rock rhythm in time with the music
You just might start a chain reaction
If you can do the Bart, you're bad like Michael Jackson

Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman
Shake you body, turn it out, if you can, man
Move your butt to the side as you can, can
Everybody in the house, do the Bartman, do the Bartman

Do the Bartman, everybody, back and forth, from side to side
Do the Bartman, do the Bartman
Now, here's a dance beat that you can't deny
Turn it down will you stop that infernal racket?
Do the Bartman

Oh my ears, Lisa, put that saxophone away
You can't touch this, I didn't do it, nobody saw me do it
You can't prove anything

Now, I'm in the house feelin' good to be home
'Til Lisa starts blowin' her damn saxophone
And if it was mine, you know they'd take it away
But still I'm feelin' good, so that's okay

I'm up in my room, just a-singin' a song
Listenin' to the kicks while I'm kickin' along
Yeah, Lisa likes jazz, she's her number one fan
But I know I'm bad, 'cause I do the Bartman

Everybody, if you can do the Bartman
Shake your body, turn it out if you can, man
Move your butt to the side, as you can, can
Everybody in the house, do the Bartman, do the Bartman

Do the Bartman
Everybody, back and forth from side to side
Do the Bartman, do the Bartman
She can do it, he can do it, so can I

If you've got the groove, you gotta use it
Rock rhythm in time with the music
You just might start a chain reaction

I'm a Bartman, everybody, if you can, do the Bartman
Shake your body, turn it out, if you can, man
Move your butt to the side, as you can, can
Everybody in the house do the Bartman

Move you body, if you got the notion
Skake your body to the rock like motion
Move your hips from side to side now
Don't ya slip, let your feet glide now

If you've got your groove, you gotta use it
Rock rhythm in time with the music
Eat your heart out, Michael
You just might start a chain reaction
Oh, wow, man"

19,Stevie B,Because I Love You (The Postman Song),1991,"I got your letter from the postman just the other day
And so I decided to write you this song
Just to let you know, exactly the way I feel
To let you know my love's so real

Because I love you, I'll do anything
I'll give you my heart, my everything
Because I love you, I'll be right by your side
To be a light, to be your guide

If you should feel that I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose ground
Let me reassure you that you can count on me
And that I'll always be around

Because I love you, my heart's an open door
So won't you please come on in
Because I love you, I'll be right by your side
To be a light, to be your guide"

21,Rod Stewart,Rhythm of My Heart,1991,"Across the street, the river runs
Down in the gutter, life is slippin' away
Let me still exist in another place
Runnin' under cover, of a helicopter blade

Flames are getting higher in effigy
Burnin' down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere, some way
Where they're downin' only deer
A hundred steel towns away

Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beatin' like a drum
With the words ""I love you"" rollin' off my tongue
No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailin'

Photographs, kerosene, light up my darkness
Light it up, light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch, of your thin blue jeans
Runnin' down the alley, I've got my eyes all over you, baby
Oh baby

Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beatin' like a drum
With the words ""I love you"" rollin' off my tongue
No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing, I'll be sailing

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yanking back the handle, no expression on my face

Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beatin' like a drum
With the words ""I love you"" rollin' off my tongue
Oh, never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailin'

Oh,  the rhythm of my heart is beatin' like a drum
With the words ""I love you"" rollin' off my tongue
No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailin'

The words ""I love you"" rollin' off my tongue
Never will I roam, for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailin'"

24,Whitney Houston,All the Man That I Need,1991,"I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came

But now he's here, it's not the same, it's not the same

He fills me up, he gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got, he's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go, he won't let go

He fills me up, he gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got, he's all I've got in this world

You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me

Believing for the grass would be greener
You told yourself, ""I just don't need her now""
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday, someday
One you gave away
Will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
'Cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known

Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Someday, someday
One you gave away
Will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
'Cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Someday, someday
One you gave away
Will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
'Cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time
When you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me
The one and only

But when your down
In your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore

Someday, someday
One you gave away
Will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
'Cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Someday, someday
One you gave away
Will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
'Cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

If I die before I wake
(If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take
(Pray the Lord my soul to take)

And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

28,Chris Isaak,Wicked Game,1991,"The world was on fire and no one could save me but you*
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you.
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you.

No, I don't want to fall in love 
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't want to fall in love 
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you (This world is only gonna break your heart)

What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way.
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you.
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way.
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you and,

I want to fall in love 
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I want to fall in love 
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you.

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you.
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you,

No, I want to fall in love 
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I want to fall in love 
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you

No, I...

29,U2,Mysterious Ways,1991,"Johnny take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in to fill up your room
You've been living underground, eating from a can
You've been running away from what you don't understand
Love

She's slippy
You're sliding down
She'll be there
When you hit the ground

It's all right, it's all right, it's all right
She moves in mysterious ways
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right
She moves in mysterious ways

Johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees boy

She's the wave
She turns the tide
[Incomprehensible]
She knows why

It's all right, it's all right, all right
She moves in mysterious ways
It's all right, it's all right, all right
She moves in mysterious ways
It's all right, it's all right, all right
Lift my days, light up my nights, love

One day you will look back
And you'll see where you were held how
By this love while you could stand there
You could move on this moment, follow this feeling

It's all right, it's all right, all right
She moves in mysterious ways
It's all right, it's all right, all right
She moves in mysterious ways

Oh love, oh love
Love, no, no, no
Move you, spirit move, move
Move you, move with it
She moves with it
Lift my days, light up my nights, love"

Oh no! That's just his charms
In his warm embrace?
Oh no! That's just his arms

It's in his kiss
That's where it is
It's in his kiss
That's where it is

Kiss him and squeeze him tight
Find out what you want to know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss

How about the way he acts
Oh no! That's not the way

Call me, call me by my name or call me by my number
You put me through it
I'll still be doing it the way I do it
And yet, you try to make me forget
Who I really am, don't tell me I'm no best
I'm not the same as all the rest

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me
I've been a player in the crowd scene

A flicker on the big screen
My soul embraces one more in a million faces
High hopes and aspirations, and years above my station
Maybe but all this time I've tried to walk with dignity and pride
I can't wear this uniform without some compromises

Because you'll find out that we come

In different shapes and sizes
No one can be myself like I can
For this job I'm the best man
And while this may be true, you are the one and only you

There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

They said, it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong

That love will never do without you

Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy it's you, I can't do without

I feel better when I have you near me
'Cause no other love around
Has quite the same, ooh ooh
Like you do, do, do, do babe

Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now
And it's shinning on me
Coming out of the dark, I know the love that saved me
Sharing with me

Starting again is part of the plan
I'll be so much stronger holding your hand
Step by step, I'll make it through, I know I can
May not make it easier but I have felt you near all the way

Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now
And it's shinning on me, I see the light

Ever, ever, can't nobody stop me, watch me
Ever, and ever, stand on the rock of your
Love is all it takes, no matter what we face

Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now
And it's shinning on me, yes it's shining on me
I know the love that saved me
You're sharing, you're sharing with me, you're sharing with me
You're sharing with me, you're sharing with me

Cannot be in the dark, make it into the light, yea
You're love is shinning on me, shinning on me, shinning on me

41,Genesis,No Son of Mine,1991,"Well the key to my survival
was never in much doubt
the question was how I could keep sane
trying to find a way out

Things were never easy for me
peace of mind was hard to find
and I needed a place where I could hide
somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it
til it started happening all the time
soon I was living with the fear everyday
of what might happen that night

I couldn't stand to hear the
crying of my mother
and I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

they say that time is a healer
and now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
he looked me straight in the eyes

he said:

You're no son, you're no son of mine
You're no son, you're no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
and you're no son, no son of mine

oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
and as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

You're no son, you're no son of mine
but where should I go,
and what should I do
you're no son, you're no son of mine
but I came here for help, oh I came here for you

Well the years they passed so slowly
I thought about him everyday
what would I do, if we passed on the street
would I keep running away

in and out of hiding places
soon I'd have to face the facts
we'd have to sit down and talk it over
and that would mean going back

they say that time is a healer
and now my wounds are not the same

45,Sting,All This Time,1991,"I looked out across
The river today
I saw a city in the fog and an old church tower
Where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home
In the sodium light
Saw two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

And all this time
The river flowed
Endlessly
To the sea

Two priests came round our house tonight
One young, one old
To offer prayers for the dying
To serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach
Which way the cold wind blows
Fussing and flapping in priestly black
Like a murder of crows

And all this time, the river flowed
Endlessly
to the sea
If I had my way, I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor
for they shall inherit the earth
(One is) Better to be poor than a fat man in the eye of a needle
And as these words were spoken i swear i hear
The old man laughing,
'what good is a used up world, and how could it be
Worth having'

And all this time the river flowed
Endlessly like a silent tear
And all this time the river flowed
Father, if jesus exists,
Then how come he never lived here?
Yeah, yeah

Teachers told us
The romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple on the edge of the
Empire garrison town,
They lived and they died
They prayed to their gods
But the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbled
'Til all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found

And all this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a northern sun
If i had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations
But they only get better
One by one
One by one, by one
One by one

I looked out across
The river today
I saw a city in the fog and an old church tower
Where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home
In the sodium light
Saw two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night"
46,Michael Bolton,Love is a Wonderful Thing,1991,"Birds fly, they don't think twice
They simply spread their wings

Ain't no conjecture, it's just a matter of fact

Oh yeah

The only thing a river knows
Is runnin' to the sea
And every spring when a flower grows
It happens naturally

The same magic when you're in my arms
No logic can define, oh no
Don't know why, just feels so right
I only know it happens every time

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again

Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love, love is a wonderful thing

Oh, when the cold wind blows
I know you're gonna be there to warm me
That's what keeps me goin'
And our sweet love gonna keep on growin', just keep on growin'

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing, oh yeah
I'll say it again and again

And turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing

summer, summer, summertime
time to sit back and unwind

Verse One: Fresh Prince

Here it is the groove slightly transformed
just a bit of a break from the norm
just a little somethin' to break the monotony
of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
a little bit out of control it's cool to dance
but what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
give me a soft subtle mix
and if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
and think of the summers of the past
adjust the base and let the alpine blast
pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
and put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime

Chorus

Verse Two: Fresh Prince

school is out and it's a sort of a buzz
but back then I didn't really know what it was
but now I see what have of this
the way that people respond to summer madness
the weather is hot and girls are dressing less
and checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
ridin around in your jeep or your benzos
or in your nissan stting on lorenzos
back in Philly we be ou in the park
a place called the plateau is where everybody go
guys out hunting and girls doing likewise
honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
she turn around to see what you beeping at
it's like the summers a natural afrodesiac
and with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
to hit you and get you equipped for the summer time

Chorus

Verse Three: Fresh Prince

it's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
hustle to the mall to get me a short set
yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
the temperature's about 88
hop in the water plug just for old times sake
break to ya crib change your clothes once more
cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4
sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise
about the days growing up and the first person you kissed
and as I think back makes me wonder how
the smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
all the kids playing out front
little boys messin round with the girls playing double-dutch
while the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
then six o'clock rolls around
you just finished wiping your car down
it's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
it looks like a car show
everybody come lookin real fine
fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
every moment frontin and maxin
chillin in the car they spent all day waxin
leanin to the side but you can't speed through
two miles an hour so everybody sees you
there's an air of love and of happiness
and this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion of summer madness

To channel all this energy
Let's solve the equation
I need to feel, you close to me

So baby let your conscience go

Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long

The more I know that love belongs
With you in my mind boy
I wouldn't know what's right from wrong

'Cause love will takeover
And leave you out of sight and mind
You've got to go with the feeling
And trust fate to be kind

And baby let your conscience go

Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
And turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
And trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way, it ought to be
When a man loves a woman

I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
And baby baby please don't treat me bad
When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul

She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see
Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels

When a man loves a woman
When a man loves a woman
When a man loves a woman

Dave drop a load on 'em

OPP how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for other P is for people scratchin' temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'

Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Boy, that's what is scary)

It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
Who's down with OPP?
(Every last homie)

You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP?
(Yeah you know me)
Who's down with OPP?
(All the homies)

As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same
But the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest
I won't get into that, I'll do it, ah, sorta properly
I say the last P hmm stands for property

Now lady here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife?
And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway?
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care

'Cos in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw the skeleton bone right in the closet door

This girl ah tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that matter of fact
My girl was partner's that had a fall out
Disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cos after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, ""Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you Treach"" I said, ""Now child please""

You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said, ""Now look you to the stairs and to the stairwindow
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart
'Cos you know I was OPP, hell from the very start""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about

When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with
Him or her for sure is going to admit it
When OPP comes, damn, skippy I'm with it

And the world seems to disappear

Say you're mine and give yourself
To the feelings that you know
I'm needin' all that you can give me
All the things that you do so well

Words are healin', sweet anticipation
Makin' spells as the shadows close in
And fall across all our yesterdays

Look into myself and reason
But I could never never see or
Make sense of the deal

Turn around I'm lookin' at salvation
Make me realize all that I am, baby
You put the light inside this man

Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

The streets of this town
Trying to find sense of it all
The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears I'd had to waste
Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?

All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help
All I can do is cry for help

No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain
Cry for help
Cry for help is all I need
All I need is a cry for help
Cry for help is all I need
All I need is a cry for help

Why can't we ever break down and cry?

I will be there when you cry for help
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

I don't wanna cry,  don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be

Though I've give you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone

Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around

I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be

Though I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry, no, no, no

All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make believing, on make believing

I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be

Though I've given you my heart and soul
Though I've given you my heart and soul oh baby
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, cry
I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry"
85,Madonna,Rescue Me,1991,"I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love
I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me

With you I'm not a little girl, with you I'm not a man
When all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand
You see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak
You see that I am silly, and pretentious and a freak

But I don't feel too strange for you, don't know exactly what you do
I think when love is pure, you try to understand the reasons why
And I prefer this mystery, it cancels out my misery
And gives me hope that there could be a person that loves me

Rescue me, it's hard to believe
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me, it's hard to believe
I'm drowning, baby, throw out your rope

With you I'm not a fascist, can't play you like a toy
And when I need to dominate, you're not my little boy
You see that I am hungry for a life of understanding
And you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding

You bring me to my knees while I'm scratching out the eyes
Of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise
And right while I am kneeling there, I suddenly begin to care
And understand that there could be a person that loves me

Rescue me, it's hard to believe
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me, it's hard to believe
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

Love is understanding
It's hard to believe life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an SOS
Stop me from drowning baby, I'll do the rest

Rescue me, it's hard to believe
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me, it's hard to believe
I'm drowning, baby, throw out your rope

Rescue me, it's hard to believe
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me, it's hard to believe
I'm drowning, baby, throw out your rope

Ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding
Ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding

Love is understanding
It's hard to believe life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an SOS
Rescue me, rescue me

It's not my business to decide how good you are for me
How valuable you are and what the world can see
Only that you try to understand me
And have the courage to love me for me

I believe, I believe in the power of love
I believe that you can rescue me
I believe, I believe in the power of love
I believe that you can rescue me

I'm singing I believe
I believe that you can rescue me
I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me

I believe in the power of love
I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love

The clouds come and go
Yet something is different
Are we falling in love?

Then your touch so warm

88,Monty Python,Always Look On the Bright Side of Life,1991,"Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C'mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life...

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know

They're not gonna make their money back, you know

89,Boyz II Men,It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday,1991,"How do I say goodbye
To what we had
The good times that made us laugh
Outweighed the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesteday

I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through
If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain

91,Queen,These Are the Days of Our Lives,1991,"Sometimes I get to feelin'
I was back in the old days, long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know

The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shinin' we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find, I still love you

You can't turn back the clock
You can't turn back the tide, ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game

No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

These are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but somethings remain
When I look and I find, no change

Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find, I still love you, I still love you"
92,Marky Mark & The Funky Bunch,Wildside,1991,"Ah yeah, huh
America the beautiful
Huh, yeah, let me introduce y'all to the Wildside

Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom, poms and bobby socks, no girl was sweeter
Come Prom time, everybody was on the line
All the fellas swinging nickel and dime

Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it all in stride
'Cause deep inside Annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer

Making 50 to 55 thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that make heartbeats accelerate

Annie took a hit, breathed two short breaths
One for life, the last for death
Now she's gone, a former Valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washe up dreams and shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the Wildside

Ron had enough of being broke everyday
Saying to himself, there's gotta be a betta way
'Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So Ron figured out a faster way to make money

Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW, a condo
Ron ended up a John Doe

A body was found in the alley but never clained
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk on the Wildside

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job, a good life, a good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed

Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an Ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound

Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupted and a young life over

Extensive searches throughout the projects
Put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect til' someone was found
Interrogated 'cause their skin was brown

Then there was Bennett, guilty until proven so
But soon as the case started moving slow
What do you know, sure as as sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit

The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill Carol, collect a big check
Blame it on a black man, what the heck?

And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling that his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge, committed suicide
This is how it is on the Wildside

Little Tiffany, only thirteen
Came to the city, place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summertime
Sittin' on a mailbox, watchin' the boys climb trees

And the girls play hopscotch
So far, her vacation was top notch
Then out of the blue, a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasin' the robbers on the stampede

Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died
Innocently on the Wildside"

Made shadows on the road

I'll never find a better love not in a minute

On a lazy summer day
Your face appeared there on my windscreen
You smiled and slipped away

You are my safety zone
I live and breathe in you

Seems it's already morning.
I see the sky,

it's so beautiful and blue.
The tv's on
but the only thing showing
Is a picture of you.

Oh I get up
and make myself some coffee.
I try to read a bit

but the story's too thin.
I thank the Lord above
You're not here to see me
in this shape I'm in.

Spending my time
Watching the days go by.
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you
think of me too.
I'm spending my time.

I try to call
but I don't know
what to tell you.
I leave a kiss

on your answering machine.
Oh help me please
Is there someone
who can make me

Wake up from this dream?

Spending my time
Watching the days go by.
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you
are missing me too.
I'm spending my time
Watching the sun go down.
I fall asleep to the sound
Of ""Tears of a clown""
A prayer gone blind.
I'm spending my time.

My friends keep telling me:
Hey, life will go on
Time will make sure
I'll get over you.
This silly game of love -
You play, you win only to lose.
I'm spending my time
Watching the days go by.
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you
think of me too.
I'm spending my time.

We climb the highest mountain
We'll make the desert bloom
We're so ingenious
We can walk on the moon

The forests have died
Saltwater wells in my eyes

I have lived for love
But now that's not enough
For the world I love is dying
(And now I'm crying)
And time is not a friend
(No friend of mine)
As friends we're out of time
And it's slowly passing by
Right before our eyes

We light the deepest ocean
Send photographs of Mars
We're so enchanted by
How clever we are
Why should one baby
Feel so hungry she cries
Saltwater wells in my eyes

I have lived for love
But now that's not enough
For the world I love is dying
