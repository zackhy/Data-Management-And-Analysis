1,Ace of Base,The Sign,1994,"I, I gotta new life, you would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you?
I, why do I bother when you're not the one for me?
It's enough, enough

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong?

I, under the clear moon for so many years
I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon where I see a lot of stars
It's enough, enough

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong? Oh oh oh

I saw the sign and it opened up my mind
And I am happy now living without you, I've left you, oh oh oh

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong

I saw the sign, I saw the sign
I saw the sign
I saw the sign, I saw the sign
I saw the sign, I saw the sign
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign"

Greatest Hits
Streets Of Philadelphia
i was bruised and battered and i couldn't tell
What i felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
I saw my reflection in a window i didn't know
My own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me
WastinÂ´away
On the streets of philadelphia

I walked the avenue till my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night i could hear the blood in my veins
Black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and i my friend
My clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip the skin

The night has fallen, i'm lyin'awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the streets of philadelphia"
4,Bryan Adams,All For Love,1994,"When it's love you give
(I'll be a man of good faith)
Then in love you live
(I'll make a stand, I won't break)

I'll be the rock you can build on
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold

When there's love inside
(I swear I'll always be strong)
Then there's a reason why
(I'll prove to you we belong)

I'll be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and pain

Let's make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need

'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

When it's love you make
(I'll be the fire in your night)
Then it's love you take
(I will defend, I will fight)

I'll be there when you need me
When honor's at stake
This vow I will make

That it's all for one and all for love
Let the one be the one you want
The one you need

'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

Don't lay our love to rest
'Cause we could stand up to you test
We got everything and more than we had planned
More than the rivers that run the land
We've got it all in our hands

Now it's all for one and all for love
(It's all for love)
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need

'Cause when it's all for one, it's one for all
(It's one for all)
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show

When there's someone that you want
When there's someone that you need
Let's make it all, all for one and all for love"

6,Mariah Carey,Without You,1994,"No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
Well I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
Ohh uah... No, No, No...
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore

7,Wet Wet Wet,Love is All Around,1994,"I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes
Love is all around me
And so the feeling grows

It's written on the wind
It's everywhere I go, oh yes, it is
So if you really love me
Come on and let it show, oh

You know, I love you, I always will
My mind's made up
By the way that I feel
There's no beginning
There'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend

I see your face before me
As I lay on my bed
I kinda get to thinking
Of all the things you said, oh yes I did

You gave your promise to me
And I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me
In everything and I do, oh yes I do

You know, I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the
Way that I feel
There's no beginning
There'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend

Got to keep it movin'
Ooh, it's written in the wind
Oh, everywhere I go, yeah, ooh well

8,Bon Jovi,Always,1994,"This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up

It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter
But without you, I give up

I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time

That I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Always, always"
9,Sheryl Crow,All I Wanna Do,1994,"Hit it
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is L.A.

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash

The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
I've got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you, that you're the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard"

Don't be afraid to be weak

If you must, then start to cry
Be yourself don't hide
Just believe in destiny.
Don't care what people say
Just follow your own way

To return to innocence.

To the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind
Can be turned away
An enchanted moment
And it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds

Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason

To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager

Beats in time with yours
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds

Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man

Bad to the bone

J'aimerais qu'on oublie leur couleur pour qu'ils esperent
Beaucoup de sentiments de races qui font qu'ils desesperent
Je veux les portes grandements ouvertes
Des amis pour parler de leur peine, de leur joie
Pour qu'ils leur filent des infos qui ne divisent pas
Changer

Of the tone the skin is livin' in

And there's a million voices
And there's a million voices
To tell you what she should be thinkin'
So you better sober up for just a second

And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you

And you say, I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard
I don't pay attention to the distance
That you're running or to
Anyone, anywhere

I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative, no no no, bad

So I turned the radio on I turned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song
The lover's in love and the other's run away
The lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay

And some of us hover when we weep for the other who was dying
Since the day they were born well
Well this is not that
I think that I'm throwing but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever
But now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take me anyhow or anywhere with you

And you said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, ""Hey I can leave, I can leave""
But now I know that I was wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah' I missed you

You said, you caught me 'cause you want me
And one day I'll let you go
You try to give away a keeper or keep me
'Cause you're know you're just too scared to lose

And you say, ""Stay""
You say, I only hear what I want to"

That I'll never let you go

Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat

Someone keeps saying, I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps
And burning' down the trailer park

Banned all the music with a phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag

With the re-run shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slop
He hung himself with a guitar string
I slap the turkey neck and it's hanging' from a pigeon wing

You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax, falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
just rollin in my ride, chillin all alone
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
on a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.

Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
all you skirts know what's up with 213
So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
some brothas shootin dice so I said ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said ""What's up?""

some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck.""
Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve
these hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Won'tcha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
they took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brotha said ""Damn, what's next?""
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around

ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down

If I had wings I would fly
let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole

Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
now they droppin and yellin
it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate
I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode

if you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb
Now Nate got the freaks
and that's a known fact
before I got jacked I was on the same track
back up back up cause it's on

N A T E and me
the Warren to the G
Just like I thought
they were in the same spot
in need of some desperate help

the Nate Dogg and the G-child
were in need of something else
one of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""ooo I like your size.""
she said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice
would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell

To listen to me whine
About nothin' and
Everything all at once

I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give
Myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind
Plays tricks on me

It all keeps addin' up
I think I'm crackin' up
And am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

Yea, I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex
That's bringin' me down

And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So I quit my whinin'
'Cause it's bringin' her down

Plays tricks on me

Ah, yea, yea, yea

Go, go
Grasping to control

Forget your trouble and smile
Let your heart speak awhile
Let the light of love shine through

Change to dream
Flow in the rhythm like a stream
Fear no evil, fear no man

Ease the pressure, let it all go

More to do than can ever be done

Some say live and let live
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give

In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars

There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding

It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith

Without you, oh I cannot live, forgive, the yearning, burning,
I believe in time, too real to feel.
So, take me now,
take me now,
take me now.

You make me hard, you make me weak
Love is strong and you're so sweet
And someday babe, we got to meet

A glimpse of you was all it took
A stranger's glance, it got me hooked
And I followed you across the stars
I looked for you in seedy bars

What are you scared of, baby?
It's more than just a dream
I need some time
We make a beautiful team, a beautiful team

Love is strong and you're so sweet
And someday babe, we got to meet
Just anywhere out in the park
Out on the street and in the dark

I followed you through swirling seas
Down darkened woods with silent trees
Your love is strong and you're so sweet
You make me hard, you make me weak

What are you scared of, baby?
It's more than just a dream
I need some time
We make a beautiful team, beautiful

I wait for you until the dawn
My mind is ripped, my heart is torn
Your love is strong and you're so sweet
Your love is bitter and taken neat

You show me how

I look at things now
In a different light than I did before
I found the cause
And I think that you could be my cure
And you say
Walk your path

Is to set our children free

Is in the balance of the angels
And underneath the wheels of passion
I keep the faith in my fashion

And shout my name at heaven's gate

And I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate

An' Heaven's no longer above
And hellfire's a promise away
I'd still be saying

I'm still in love, I'm still in love

What you're goin' through
But time is the space
Between me and you

Life carries on, it goes on

Just say, die
And that would be pessimistic
In your mind
We can walk across the water

Please don't cry
It's just a prayer for the dying
I just don't know
What's got into me

Been crossin' that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playin' with fire
And not gettin' burned

I may not know
What you're going through
But time is the space
Between me and you

There is a light
Through that window
Hold on, say, yes
While people say no

Life carries on, oh
It goes on

I'm crossin' that bridge
With lessons I've learned

Believe in all the things that you tell

You know I'd love for you to lead me and follow through completely
So won't you give me all I ask for
And if you give your very best to bring me happiness
I'll show you just how much I adore you

'Cause you mean the world to me, you are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters, matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
'Cause you mean so much to me

Now it's gonna take some workin', but I believe you're worth it
As long as your intentions are good, so good
There is just one way to show it and boy I hope you know it
That no one could love you like I could

Lord knows I want to trust you and always, baby, how I'd love you
I'm not sure if love is enough
And I will not be forsaken and I hope there's no mistakin'
So tell me that you'll always be true

Baby, you mean the world to me, you are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters, matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
'Cause you mean so much to me

There's a feeling in my heart that I know I can't escape
So please don't let me fall, don't let it be too late
There's a time when words are good and they just get in the way
So show me how you feel, baby, I'm for real

Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

88,Stiltskin,Inside,1994,"Swing low in the dark glass hour
You turn and cower see it turn to dust
Move on the stoned dark night
We take to flight
Snowfall turns to rust
Seems an infusion mine like a nursing rhyme
Fat man starts to fall
Here in a hostile place I hear your face starts to call

And if you think that I've been losing my way
That's because I'm slightly blinded
And if you think that I don't make too much sense
That's because I'm broken minded

Don't keep it
If you believe it
Don't keep it all inside (no, no).

Strong words in a Ganges sky I have to lie
Shadows move in pairs
Ring out from a blue sports car in the shooting yard
Looking through the tears
Out of the black slate time we move in line
But never reach an end
Falling along straight town as the ice comes down
River starts to bend

And if you think that I've been losing my way
That's because I'm slightly blinded
And if you think that I don't make too much sense
That's because I'm broken minded

Don't keep it
If you believe it
Don't keep it all inside (no, no).

Don't keep it
If you believe it
Don't keep it all inside (no, no).

Don't keep it
If you believe it
Don't keep it all inside (no, no)."

99,Ace of Base,Living in Danger,1994,"Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing
You can do what you want, you can live in a dream
Get up, get in, get the rhythm, get down

You're living your life in peace and in harmony
You making your own decisions
That's how it's got to be for you and me
So many people are running around and 'round
Without any sense of logic

I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
(Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing)
Woah, you'll be living in danger
  (You can do what you want, you can live in a dream)
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
(Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing)
Woah, you'll be living in danger
  (You can do what you want, you can live in a dream)
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger

People are the same today as they used to be
The same expectations
So high no one can reach that high
Not I nor you get satisfied today
We'll never get enough

I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger
(Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing)
Woah, you'll be living in danger
  (You can do what you want, you can live in a dream)
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
(Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing)
Woah, you'll be living in danger

I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
(Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing)
Woah, you'll be living in danger
  (You can do what you want, you can live in a dream)
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger

People are the same today as they used to be
We'll never get enough

I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
(Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing)
Woah, you'll be living in danger

I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
(Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing)
Woah, you'll be living in danger
  (You can do what you want, you can live in a dream)

And I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
(Oh I look into the eyes of a stranger)
Woah, you'll be living in danger
  (Oh so much danger)
And I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
(Oh I look into the eyes of a stranger)
Woah, you'll be living in danger
  (Oh so much danger)

(Oh so much danger)
In the eyes of a stranger
(Oh look into the eyes of a stranger, oh)
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
(In the eyes of a stranger)
 Woah, you'll be living in danger
(You'll be living in danger)
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger"
100,Meat Loaf,Rock 'n' Roll Dreams Come Through,1994,"You can't run away forever
But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start
You want to shut out the night you want to shut down the sun
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart

Think of how we'd lay down together
Who we'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the Gods
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs

I treasure your love, I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it

I treasure your love, I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it

Remember everything that I told you
Well I'm telling you again that it's true
When you're alone and afraid and you're completely amazed
To find there's nothing anybody can do

Keep on believing and you'll discover baby

There's always something magic, there's always something new
And when you really, really need it the most
That's when rock 'n roll dreams come through

The beat is yours forever, the beat is always true
And when you really, really need it the most
That's when rock 'n roll dreams come through, for you

Once upon a time was a back beat
Once upon a time all the chords came to life
And the angels had guitars even before they had wings
If you hold on to a chorus you can get through the night

I treasure your love, I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it

I treasure your love, I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it

Remember everything that I told you
Well I'm telling you again that it's true
You're never alone 'cause you can put on the phones
And let the drummer tell your heart what to do

Keep on believing and you'll discover baby

There's always something magic, there's always something new
And when you really, really need it the most
That's when rock 'n roll dreams come through

The beat is yours forever, the beat is always true
And when you really, really need it the most
That's when rock 'n roll dreams come through, for you
Yeah

The beat is yours forever
That's when rock 'n roll dreams come through
