I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
But now it's all right, that's okay
You may look the other way

The New York Times' effect on man

And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes

4,Bee Gees,Night Fever,1978,"Listen to the ground, there is movement all around
There is something going down and I can feel it

Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, yeah and the feeling is bright

Then I get night fever, night fever, we know how to do it

In the heat of our love, don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough to take us to the morning
 I got fire in my mind, I get higher in my walking
And I'm glowing in the dark, I give you warning

And the sweet city woman, she moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul

6,Gerry Rafferty,Baker Street,1978,"Winding your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well, another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people, but it's got no soul
And it's taken you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're trying, you're trying now
Another year and then you'd be happy

Just one more year and then you'd be happy

But you're crying, you're crying now

Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen
And you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one-night stands
And then he'll settle down
In some quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone
And when you wake up, it's a new morning
The sun is shining, it's a new morning
And you're going, you're going home"
7,Bonnie Tyler,It's a Heartache,1978,"It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down
It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown
It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he'll let you down
It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for youIt Ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you
It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

Hold you close to me

The Commodores

Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something i must say out loud

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you...
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you... I love you...

When we are together the moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you... I love you..."
10,Frankie Valli,Grease,1978,"I solve my problems and I see the light
We gotta plug and think, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger, we can go too far
We start believing now that we can be who we are

Grease is the word

They think our love is just a growing pain
Why don't they understand it's just a crying shame?
Their lips are lying, only real is real
We start to find right now, we got to be what we feel

Grease is the word
Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling

We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are

Grease is the word
Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, Grease is the way we are feeling

This is the life of illusion
Wrapped up in trouble, laced with confusion
What are we doing here?

We take pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance, we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are

Grease is the word
Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove, it's got meaning

I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you

I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you

I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings

It's just some friends of mine that say
""Hey, what's the matter man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dyin' to meet you""

""We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to""

Oh, everybody waits so long
Oh baby, why you wait so long?
Won't you come home, come home?

I've been walking Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy

Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Ask me people, ""What's the matter with you boy?""

Sometimes I want to say to myself
Sometimes I say

I won't miss you child

I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord, I won't keep you child

You've been blotting out my mind
Fooling on my time
No, I won't miss you, baby, yeah

Lord, I miss you child
Lord, I miss you child
Lord, I miss you child"

I can't breathe when you're away, it pulls me down

Love Is In The Air
John Paul Young---Love Is In The Air 

Love is in the air 
Everywhere I look around 
Love is in the air 
Every sight and every sound 

And I don't know if I'm being foolish 
Don't know if I'm being wise 
But it's something that I must believe in 
And it's there when I look in your eyes 

Love is in the air 
In the whisper of the trees 
Love is in the air 
In the thunder of the sea 

And I don't know if I'm just dreaming 
Don't know if I feel sane 
But it's something that I must believe in 
And it's there when you call out my name 

Love is in the air, Love is in the air, oh, oh, oh... 

Love is in the air 
In the rising of the sun 
Love is in the air 
When the day is nearly done 

And I don't know if you're an illusion 
Don't know if I see it true 
But you're something that I must believe in 
And you're there when I reach out for you 

Love is in the air 
Every sight and every sound 
And I don't know if I'm being foolish 
Don't know if I'm being wise 

But it's something that I must believe in 
And it's there when I look in your eyes 

Love is in the air, Love is in the air, oh, oh, oh..."

But the heartache lives on inside
And who's the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight

And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go

I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart

It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling

You know that
There'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight

Goodnight, goodnight

26,Boney M,Rasputin,1978,"Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear

He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstacy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire

Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the Kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze

For the Queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

(But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
For power became known to more and more people
The demands to do something about this outrageous
Man became louder and louder)

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

""This man's just got to go!"" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged ""Don't you try to do it, please""
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms

Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
""Come to visit us"" they kept demanding
And he really came

Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and said ""I feel fine""
Ra ra Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra ra Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead
(Oh, those Russians)"

28,Player,Baby Come Back,1978,"Spending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again
Trying to forget you is just a waste of time

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

All day long, wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up the smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

Now that I put it all together
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart
Nothing left for me, ain't there nothing left for me

29,Barbra Streisand,You Don't Bring Me Flowers,1978,"You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs

You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come through that door at the end of the day

I remember when you couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after loving me late at night

When it's good for you, babe
And you're feeling all right

When you just roll over and turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

It used to be so natural

It used to be

To talk about forever

Mmm

But used-to-bes don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
Till we sweep them away

And baby I remember all the things you taught me

I learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry

Well, I learned how to love and I learned how to lie

So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye

So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye

You don't bring me flowers any more

Well, you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye

Because you don't say you need me

You don't sing me love songs

You don't bring me flowers anymore"
30,Anne Murray,You Needed Me,1978,"I cried a tear
You wiped it dry
I was confused
You cleared my mind

I sold my soul
You bought it back for me
And held me up
And gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again

You put me high
Upon a pedestal
So high that I could
Almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you
I can't believe it's true
I needed you
And you were there

And I'll never leave
Why should I leave, I'd be a fool
'Cause I've finally found
Someone who really cares

You held my hand
When it was cold
When I was lost
You took me home

You gave me hope
When I was at the end
And turned my lies
Back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again

You put me high
Upon a pedestal
So high that I could
Almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

The wiliow turns his back on inclement weather;
And if he can do it, we can do it, just me and you,

And a little luck, we can clear it up.
We can bring it in for a landing,
With a little luck, we can turn it on.
There can be no misunderstanding.

There is no end to what we can do together.
There is no end, there is no end.
The willow turns his back on inclement weather;
We can do it, just me and you.

With a little push, we could set it off.
We can send it rocketing skywards.
With a little love, we could shake it up.
Don't you feel the comet exploding?

Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

Summer night city

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

In the sun I feel like sleeping, I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me, tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

When the night comes with the action I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction from that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give, time to breathe and time to live

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

It's elusive call it glitter somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter, we don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air, my kind of people everywhere

When the night comes with the action I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction from that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when the dawning and the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning nothings worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach scattered driftwood on the beach

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark

I'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie.
And who am I to judge you on what you say or do
I'm only just beginning to see the real you.

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide.
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.

Romance and all its strategy leaves me battling with my pride.
But through the insecurity some tenderness survives.
I'm just another writer, still trapped within my truths.
A hesitant prize fighter, still trapped within my youth.

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide.
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.

At times I'd like to break you and drag you to your knees.
At times I'd like to break through and hold you endlessly.
At times I understand you, and I know how hard you've tried.
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by.

At times I think we're drifters, still searching for a friend.
A brother or a sister, but then the passion flares again.
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide.
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides."

turning it on now, he's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for
second; the ball is bobbled out in center, and here comes the
throw, and what a throw! He's gonna slide in head first, here he
comes, he's out! No, wait, safe-safe at second base, this kid
really makes things happen out there. Batter steps up to the
plate, here's the pitch-he's going, and what a jump he's got,
he's trying for third, here's the throw, it's in the dirt-safe at
third! Holy cow, stolen base! He's taking a pretty big lead out
there, almost daring him to try and pick him off. The pitcher
glances over, winds up, and it's bunted, bunted down the third
base line, the suicide squeeze is on! Here he comes, squeeze
play, it's gonna be close, holy cow, I think he's gonna make it!

Stop right there!
I gotta know right now!
Before we go any further!
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?
Will you take me away and will you make me your wife?
Do you love me!?
Will you love me forever!?
Do you need me!?
Will you never leave me!?
Will you make me happy for the rest of my life!?
Will you take me away and will you make me your wife!?
I gotta know right now

Do you love me!?
Will you love me forever!?

Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
And I'll give you an answer in the morning
Let me sleep on it

Let me sleep on it
And I'll give you an answer in the morning
Let me sleep on it

What's it gonna be boy? Yes or no?

Yes ... Or ... No?

Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
And I'll give you an answer in the morning
I gotta know right now!

Let me sleep on it (do you love me?)
Will you love me forever? (Baby baby, let me sleep on it)

Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life? (Let me sleep on it)

before we go any further
Do you love me? Will you love me forever?

Let me sleep on it! (will you love me forever?)
Let me sleep on it! (will you love me forever?)

I couldn't take it any longer
Lord I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore that I would love you to the end of time!
So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time,
So I can end my time with you!

It was long ago and it was far away
And it was so much better that it is today
It was long ago and it was far away
And it was so much better that it is today
It was long ago and it was far away
And it was so much better that it is today
It was long ago and it was far away
And it was so much better that it is today
It was long ago and it was far away
And it was so much better that it is today"

Ask me how I know and I'll tell you so
She use ta be my girl

I used to neglect her
She wanted more than I could give

But as long as I live she'll be my girl
She use ta be my girl
She use ta be my girl

She had a charming personality
The girl was so right for me
She's my girl and if I had the chance
I know I would take her back

As a matter of fact, right away that day
Not only good lookin', the girl was so smart
You can't beat her cookin'
Ask her how I know and I'll tell you so
She use ta be my girl

Deep down inside I still love her
I would place no one above her
She's warm and sensitive

For as long as I live she'll be my girl
If I had the chance I'd take her back
As a matter of fact right away, by today

Good lovin', the girl's got plenty good lovin'
Ask me how I know and I will tell you so
She use ta be my girl, my girl

She use ta be, use ta be my girl
She use ta be my girl

60,Barry Manilow,Ready To Take A Chance,1978,"You remind me I live in a shell
Safe from the past and doing okay
But not very well
No jolts no surprises no crisis arises
My life goes along as it should
It's all very nice but not very good...
And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to put my life on the line
With you...
Been living with nothing to show for it
You get what you get when you go for it
And I'm ready to take a chance again with you...

When she left me in all my despair
I just held on my hopes were all gone
Then I found you there
And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to put my love on the line
With you
Been living with nothing to show for it
You get what you get when you go for it
And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to put my love on the line
With you
Been living with nothing to show for it
You get what you get when you go for it
And I'm ready to take a chance again
Ready to take a chance again with you...
With you..."

64,Meat Loaf,Two Out of Three Ain't Bad,1978,"Maybe we can talk all night,
but that ain't getting us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can,
there's nothin' left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night,
but that'll never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside,
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out,
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long,
I'm cryin' icicles instead of tears
And all I can do, is keep on tellin' you
I want you (I want you),
I need you (I need you)
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad (don't be sad 'cause)'
Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad, ('cause)
'cause two out of three ain't bad
You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're lookin' for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coupe de Ville hidin' at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box
I can't lie (I can't lie...)
I can't tell you that I'm somethin' I'm not
No matter how I try, I'll never be able
To give you somethin', somethin' that I just haven't got (woh-oh)
Well there's only one girl that I will ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back, ooh-ooh I know
Well I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Ahh, she kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away
And she kept on tellin' me,
She kept on tellin' me,
She kept on tellin' me
I want you (I want you)
I need you (I need you)
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you

And though I tried to hide it I found myself looking to see

Your touch took my breath away
But when you said hello are you ready to go
Well I had just one thing to say.

If you can't give me love honey that ain't enough.
Let me go look for somebody else.
And if you can give me feelings with old fashioned meanings.

Then just stay in love with yourself.
If you can't give me love.
If you can't give me love.

If you can't give me love.
Well you may be a king of this discotheque thing.
But honey I ain't looking for that.

What I need is a man not some sort of aristocrat.
Oh if only you'd waited or just hesitated.
Or maybe just asked me to dance.

And just like the first time I'll be shakin' inside
When I walk in the door there'll be no place to hide

I wanna build my world around you...
Tell you that it's true
I wanna make you understand I'm talking about a lifetime plan...
That's the way it began we were hand in hand
Glenn Miller's band was better than before

We yelled and screamed for more
And the Porter tune
(Night and Day)

Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
On the way back home I promised you'd never be alone...
Hurry don't be late
I can hardly wait I said to myself when we're old

We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing
Friday night it was late I was walking you home we got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night

Each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing spending the hours reminiscing...

Every time they were sure they had you caught
You were quicker than they thought
You'd just turn your back and walk

You always said the cards would never do you wrong
The trick, you said, was never play the game too long
A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take
The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake

And you're still the same
I caught up with you yesterday
Moving game to game
No one standing in your way
Turning on the charm
Long enough to get you by
You're still the same
You still aim high

There you stood, everybody watched you play
I just turned and walked away
I had nothing left to say

'Cause you're still the same
You're still the same
Moving game to game
Some things never change
You're still the same"

A policeman knew my name
He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away""
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwin' punches around
And preachin' from my chair

Back to the Rollin' Pin

With a streak of Rin Tin Tin

And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan

Where love falls from the trees

Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

So tall, so wide, so high above the rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere, are the tears are yesterday
We killed the pain, we blew away the memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die

89,Heatwave,Always & Forever,1978,"Always and forever, each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me that somehow came true
And I know tomorrow will still be the same
'Cause we've got a life of love that won't ever change and

Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
I'll always love you forever, forever

There'll always be sunshine when I look at you
It's something I can't explain just the things that you do
And if you get lonely phone me and take
A second to give to me that magic you make and

Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
I'll always love you ever, ever

Loving you is the thing that I've planned
For a very long time
Me with you, you with me, we as one
Love together for a very long time
Loving you, you, baby

Always, forever love you
Always, forever love you
Always, forever love you

I said, ""Forever love you, love you""
Ever and the day and one day
Loving you, you, you, you, you
Forever, tomorrow's tomorrow

Ever and a day, ever and a day
Ever, everyday, yeah, you
Loving you forever, ever, you, you
Forever"
90,The Rolling Stones,Beast of burden,1978,"I'll never be your beast of burden
My back is broad but it's a hurting
All I want for you to make love to me

I'll never be your beast of burden

All I want is for you to make love to me

All your sickness I can suck it up
Throw it all at me I can shrug it off
There's one thing baby that I don't understand

91,Jackson Browne,Running On Empty,1978,"Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In sixty-five I was seventeen and running up one-on-one
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

Running on-running on empty
Running on-running blind
Running on-running into the sun

But I'm running behind
Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own

I don't know when that road turned into the road I'm on
Running on-running on empty
Running on-running blind

Running on-running into the sun
But I'm running behind
Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me

If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels

I look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them running too
Running on-running on empty

Running on-running blind
Running on-running into the sun
But I'm running behind
Honey you really tempt me
You know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
Running into the sun but I'm running behind"
92,Bill Withers,Lovely Day,1978,"When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be a lovely day

Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be a lovely day

Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me

And when someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

But in the morning make sure you're gone
I'm talkin' to you

You gotta most persuasive tongue

Hot legs, in your satin shoes
Hot legs, are you still in school?
Hot legs, you're making me a fool

Desiree


Written by: Neil Diamond

It was the third of June
On that summer's day
Well I became a man
At the hands of a girl
Almost twice my age
And she came to me
Just like a morning sun
And it wasn't so much
Her words as such
As the way they were sung
It was the way they were sung

Desiree
Oh, Desiree
There I was found
By the sweet passion sound
Of your loving song
Time was right, the night was long
Remember, Desiree
Oh, Desiree
Somehow I knew
I could only have you
'Til the morning light
If only for that single night
Sweet Desiree, you make it right

Then came the fourth of June
On that sleepless night
Well I tossed and I turned
While the thought of her burned
Up and down my mind
For she was there and gone
Without one regret
But she continues on
Like the words of a song
I could not forget
I could not forget

Desiree
Oh, Desiree
There I was found
By the sweet passion sound
Of your loving song
Time was right, the night was long
Remember, Desiree
Oh, Desiree
And though somehow I knew
I could only have you
'Til the morning light
The night was long, the time was right
Do you remember Desiree"
97,Chuck Mangione,Feels So Good,1978,"There's no place for me to hide
The thoughts of all the time I cried
And felt this pain
That I have known
Because I needed just to hear
That special something

And then one day
You just appear
You said ""hello""
""Let's make love along the way""
Your name is music to my heart
I'll always really love you

Feel so good when I'm with you
I can't believe you love me too
With you it feels like it should feel
With you it feels so good"
98,"Earth, Wind & Fire",Fantasy,1978,"Every man has a place
In his heart there's a space
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship, fantasize
All your dreams will come true right away

And we will live together
Until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever, as one

Every thought is a dream
Rushing by in a stream
Bringing life to the kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship, fantasize
All your dreams will come true miles away

Our voices will ring together
Until the twelfth of never
We all will live love forever, as one

Come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life, a new degree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

As one, come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To behold, to your soul is ecstasy

You will find other kind
That has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize, it's your life now in review

And as you stay for the play
Fantasy has in store for you
A glowing light will see you through
It's your day, shining day
All your dreams come true
As you glide in your stride
With the wind as you fly away
Give a smile from your lips and say
I'm free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way
Come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find other kind
That has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize, it's your life now in review"
99,Robert Palmer,Every Kinda People,1978,"Said the fight to make ends meet
Keeps a man upon his feet
Holding down his job
Trying to show he can't be bought

Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
Every kinda people
To make the world go 'round

Someone's looking for a lead
In his duty to a king or to a creed
Protecting what he feels is right
Fights against wrong with his life

There is no profit in deceit
Honest men know that
Revenge does not taste sweet
Whether yellow, black or white
Each and every man's the same inside

Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

You know that love's the only goal
That could bring a peace to any soul
Hey, and every man's the same
He wants the sunshine in his name

Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
