2,John Lennon,Imagine,1971,"Imagine there's no Heaven
It's easy if you try
No Hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people
Livin' for today
Aaa haa

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too

Imagine all the people
Livin' life in peace
Yoo hoo

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharin' all the world
Yoo hoo

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one"
3,Lynn Anderson,I Beg Your Pardon (I Never Promised You a Rose Garden),1971,"LYNN ANDERSON
New! Tap highlighted lyrics to add Meanings, Special Memories, and Misheard Lyrics...
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time
When you take you gotta give so live and let live
Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you
I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talkin' about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time,
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden"
4,Rod Stewart,Maggie May,1971,"Wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and
Mother what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these, these days"

6,Three Dog Night,Joy to the World,1971,"Jeremiah was a bullfrog

She's a lady.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
She's a lady.
Talkin' about that little lady,
and the lady is mine.

Well she never asks for very much and I don't refuse her.
Always treat her with respect, I never would abuse her.
What she's got is hard to find, and I don't want to lose her
Help me build a mansion from my little pile of clay.
Hey, hey, hey.
Well she knows what I'm about,
She can take what I dish out, and that's not easy,
Well she knows me through and through,
She knows just what to do, and how to please me.

Who's the black private dick
That's a sex machine to all the chicks?

Who is the man
That would risk his neck for his brother man?

Can ya dig it?
Who's the cat that won't cop out
When there's danger all about

9,Tony Orlando & Dawn,Knock Three Times,1971,"Hey girl, what ya doin' down there?
Dancin' alone every night
While I live right above you

I can hear your music playin'
I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me
You don't even know me, I love you

Oh, my darling, knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Twice on the pipe
If the answer is no

Oh, my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Oh, twice on the pipe
Means you ain't gonna show

If you look out your window tonight
Pull in the string with the note
That's attached to my heart

Read how many times I saw you
How in my silence I adored you
And only in my dreams did
That wall between us come apart

Oh, my darling, knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Mmm, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no

Oh, my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Whoa, twice on the pipe
Means you ain't gonna show

Oh, I can hear the music playin'
I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me
You don't even know me, I love you

Oh, my darling, knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Oh, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no

Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Mmm, twice on the pipe
Means you ain't gonna show"
10,Carole King,It's Too Late,1971,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time
There's something wrong here there can be no denyin'
One of us is changin' or maybe we've just stopped tryin'
And it's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide it and I just can't fake it
Oh, no-no-no-no
(no-no-no-no)

It used to be so easy livin' here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
And it's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
(we can't make it)
Something inside has died and I can't hide it and I just can't fake it
Oh, no-no
Do-do-do-do-do
(la-la-la-la-la)
There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you
But it's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
(we can't make it now)
Something inside has died and I can't hide it and I just can't fake it
Oh, no-no-no-no-no
It's too late
Baby
It's too late
Now darlin'
It's too l-a-t-e..."
11,Janis Joplin,Me & Bobby McGee,1971,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge waitin' for a train
And I was feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
It rode us all the way into New Orleans

I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' don't mean nothin' honey if it ain't free
And feelin' good was easy, Lord, Bobby sang the blues
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything that we'd done
So Bobby baby, he kept me from the cold

One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, Bobby sang the blues
I said feelin' good was good enough for me, mmm hmm
Was good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

Hey, my Bobby, Lord, my Bobby McGee, yeah

Hey, I call him my lover, I call him my man
I said I call him my lover, did the best I can
Said now come on Bobby, Lord, come on Bobby McGee, yeah

14,Paul McCartney,Another Day,1971,"Everyday she takes a morning bath she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day

Slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day

At the office where the papers grow she takes a break
Drinks another coffee and she finds it hard to stay awake
It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day

So sad, so sad, sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in her apartment she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell

Stay, don't stand around and he comes and he stays
But he leaves the next day, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad

As she posts another letter to the sound of five
People gather 'round her and she finds it hard to stay alive
It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day

So sad, so sad, sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in her apartment she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell

Stay, don't stand around and he comes and he stays
But he leaves the next day, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad

Everyday she takes a morning bath she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day

Slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day"

16,Led Zeppelin,Stairway to Heaven,1971,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold

And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to heaven"
17,Ringo Starr,It Don't Come Easy,1971,"It don't come easy,
You know it don't come easy.

Got to pay your dues if you wanna sing the blues,
And you know it don't come easy.
You don't have to shout or leap about,
You can even play them easy.

Forget about the past and all your sorrows,
The future won't last,
It will soon be over tomorrow.

I don't ask for much, i only want your trust,
And you know it don't come easy.
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time,
And you know it just ain't easy.

Open up your heart, let's come together,
Use a little love
And we will make it work out better.

Peace, remember peace is how we make it,
Here within your reach
If you're big enough to take it.

And you know it don't come easy.
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time,
And you know it don't come easy."

It'll rain on a sunny day

I know!
Shining down like water
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Sun is cold and rain is hard

I know!
Been that way for all my time
'Til forever on it goes

Through the circle fast and slow
I know!
It can't stop, I wonder
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Yeah!
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?"

To brighten up even your darkest night

I'll come running (oh yeah, baby)
To see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, (yeah yeah yeah)
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow

Keep your head together
And call my name out loud now
Soon I'll be knocking upon your door

You just call out my name

I'll come running (Oh, yes I will)
To see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah yes

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold?
They'll hurt you and desert you
Well, they'll take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them

You just call out my name
And, you know, wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again
(Oh baby don't you know 'bout)
Winter, spring, summer or fall
(Hey Now) All you've got to do is call
Lord I'll be there, yes I will

I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor
Ha
But then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind

By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

But nowadays, I'm lost between two shores
LA's fine, but it ain't home

I am, said I
And I am lost, and I can't even say why
Leavin' me lonely still

Did you ever read about a frog who dreamed of being a king
And then became one
Well, except for the names and a few other changes
If you talk about me, the story's the same one

But I got an emptiness deep inside
And I've tried but it won't let me go
And I'm not a man who likes to swear
But I've never cared for the sound of being alone

I am, I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all

We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsys, tramps, and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down
Picked up a boy just south of Mobile
Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal
I was sixteen, he was twenty-one
Rode with us to Memphis
And Papa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done

The bright red Georgia clay
And how it stuck to the tires
After the summer rain
Will power made that old car go
A woman's mind told me that so
Oh how I wish
We were back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named boo
Travellin' and livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named boo
How I love being a free man

I can still recall
The wheat fields of St. Paul

And the morning we got caught
Robbing from an old hen
Old McDonald he made us work
But then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas
And back on the road again

I'll never forget the day
We motored stately into big L.A.
The lights of the city put settlin'
Down in my brain
Though it's only been a month or so
That old car's buggin' us to go
We've gotta get away and get back on
The road again"

seems to follow me wherever I go,

Everytime I think I've had enough
and start heading for the door,

piercing me right through the core,
It says, ""Turn around, you fool, you know you love him more and more.""
Tell me why is it so.

Don't wanna let go.

'cos I did what I did for Maria.

As I rode into town
with the sun going down
all the windows were barred
there was no-one around
for they knew that I'd come
with my hand on my gun
and revenge in my heart for Maria
my dearest departed Maria.

Take an eye for an eye
and a life for a life
and somebody must die
for the death of my wife
yes I did what I did for Maria
I did what I did for Maria.



Laughter echoed across from
the end of the street
there was the man
I was burnin' to meet
and my mind was so calm and so clear.
as I took my revenge for Maria.

And he fell to the ground
raisin' dust all around
but I knew he was dead
long before he went down
it was quick it was clean
made it easy on him
which is more than he did for Maria.
When he did what he did to Maria.

And show her that she is my, girl
When she says, ""Hello world""
I need her sharing the world beside me

That's why I've got to be there
Got to be there where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me she's home

Got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there

They were half a million strong
Everywhere there were songs
And celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust, we are golden

there's no one home but you, You're all that's left me too.
And when, my love, for life is running dry,
you come, and pour, yourself, on me.

If a man could be two places at one time I'd be with you.
tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.

77,Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,Mr Bojangles,1971,"I knew a man, Bojangles and he'd dance for you
In worn out shoes.
With silver hair and ragged shirt and baggy pants,
He did the old soft shoe.
He jumped so high, he jumped so high
And then he lightly touched down.

I met him in a cell in New Orleans I was - down and out.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out.
He talked of life, he talked of life, he laughed, clicked his heels and stepped.

He said his name ""Bojangles"" and he danced a lick,
across the cell
He grabbed his pants and spread his stance,
Oh he jumped so high
and then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, let go a laugh,
sback his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles. Mr. Bojangles.
Mr. Bojangles, Dance

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
throughout the south
He spoke through tears of 15 years how his dog and him
they traveled about.
Well the dog up and died, he up and died.
And after 20 years he still grieves.

He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
for drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
'cause I drinks a bit
He shis head, and as he shis head
I heard someone ask him please, pleeease.
Mr. Bojangles. Mr. Bojangles.
Mr. Bojangles, won't you Dance.
I knew a man, Bojangles and he danced for you."

95,Cat Stevens,Peace Train,1971,"Now I've been happy lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun

Oh, I've been smilin' lately
Dreamin' about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Some day it's goin' to come

'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again

Now I've been smilin' lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun

Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Come on now, peace train

Yes, peace train, holy roller
Everyone jump up on the peace train
Come on now, peace train

Get your bags together
Go bring your good friends too
Because it's gettin' nearer
It soon will be with you

Now come and join the livin'
It's not so far from you
And it's gettin' nearer
Soon it will all be true

Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Come on now peace train, peace train

Now I've been cryin' lately
Thinkin' about the world as it is
Why must we go on hatin'?
Why can't we live in bliss?

'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again

Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Come on now, peace train

Yes, it's the peace train

Come on now, peace train, oh peace train"
96,Tommy James & the Shondells,Draggin' the Line,1971,"Makin' a living the old hard way
Takin' and giving by day by day
I dig snow and rain and bright sunshine

Draggin' the line (draggin' the line)

My dog Sam eats purple flowers
We ain't got much but what we got's ours
We dig snow and rain and bright sunshine

Draggin' the line (draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (draggin' the line)

I feel fine I'm talkin' bout peace of mind
I'm gonna take my time I'm gettin' the good sign

Draggin' the line (draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (draggin' the line)

Loving the free and feelin' spirit
Of huggin' a tree when you get near it
Diggin' the snow and rain and bright sunshine

Draggin' the line (draggin' the line)

I feel fine I'm talkin' bout peace of mind
I'm gonna take my time I'm gettin' the good sign

Draggin' the line (draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (draggin' the line)
Draggin' the line (draggin' the line)..."
97,Cat Stevens,Wild World,1971,"Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'
Baby, I'm grievin'

But if you wanna leave, take good care
I hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
Because I never wanna see you a sad girl
Don't be a bad girl

But if you wanna leave, take good care
I hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

98,Five Man Electrical Band,Signs,1971,"And the sign said, ""Long-haired freaky people need not apply""
So I tucked my hair up under my hat and I went in to ask him why
He said, ""You look like a fine upstanding young man, I think you'll do""
So I took off my hat, I said, ""Imagine that, huh, me workin' for you""
Whoa, oh, oh

Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind
Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?

And the sign said, â€½Anybody caught trespassin' would be shot on sightâ€
So, I jumped on the fence and-a yelled at the house
""Hey, what gives you the right?
To put up a fence to keep me out or to keep mother nature in
If God was here, He'd tell you to your face, man, you're some kinda sinner""

Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind
Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?

Now, hey you, Mister, can't you read?
You've got to have a shirt and tie to get a seat
You can't even watch, no you can't eat
You ain't supposed to be here
The sign said, â€½You got to have a membership card to get inside, ughâ€

And the sign said, ""Everybody welcome, come in, kneel down and pray""
But when they passed around the plate at the end of it all
I didn't have a penny to pay
So, I got me a pen and a paper and I made up my own little sign
I said, ""Thank you, Lord, for thinkin' 'bout me, I'm alive and doin' fine, wooâ€

Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind
Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?

Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
Sign
Sign, sign"
99,John Lennon,Mother,1971,"Mother, you had me, but I never had you
I wanted you, you didn't want me
So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

Father, you left me, but I never left you
I needed you, you didn't need me
So I, I just got to tell you

Goodbye, goodbye

Children, don't do what I have done
I couldn't walk and I tried to run

So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

100,Mike Curb Congregation,Burning Bridges,1971,"Friends all tried to warn me
But I held my head up high
All the time they warned me
But I only passed them by

They all tried to tell me
But I guess, I didn't care
I turned my back and
Left them standing there

All the burning bridges that have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings and the burning memories
Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore

Joey tried to help me find a job, a while ago
When I finally got it I didn't want to go
The party Mary gave for me when I just walked away
Now there's nothing left for me to say

All the burning bridges that have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings and the burning memories
Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore

Years have passed and I keep thinking, what a fool I've been
I look back into the past and think of way back then
I know that I lost everything I thought I that could win
I guess, I should have listened to my friends

All the burning bridges that have fallen after me
All the lonely feelings and the burning memories
Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door
Burning bridges lost forevermore
Burning bridges lost forevermore"
