1,UB40,Can't Help Falling in Love,1993,"Wise men say - Only fools rush in,
But I can't help falling in love with you.

Wise men say - Only fools rush in,
But I can't help falling in love with you.

Shall I stay - Would it be a sin,
But I can't help falling in love with you.

As the river flows
gently to the sea
Darling so we go
some things were meant to be

Take my hand - Take my whole life too,
But I can't help falling in love with you.

As the river flows
gently to the sea
Darling so we go
some things were meant to be

Take my hand - Take my whole life too,
But I can't help falling in love with you.

I can't help falling in love with you.
I can't help falling in love with you.
I can't help falling in love with you."

Slap me in my face, look all of my gap
They have no clues and they wanna get warmer
But Shan won't turn informer

3,Ace of Base,All That She Wants,1993,"She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
""Oh, what a morning""

It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just lying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yea

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yea

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's the hunter you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever

It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yea

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yea

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yea

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yea

All that she wants
All that she wants"
4,Meat Loaf,I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That),1993,"And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no, no way.
And I would do anything for love

But I won't do that
No I won't do that
Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love

I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that
And some days, it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathing fire

And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before

Or will again
And maybe I'm crazy

Oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me

No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You better believe it

That I would do anything for love
I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love!
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact

But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way

Tonight
And I would do anything for love

Oh I would do anything for love

Oh I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I wont do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of

But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love

Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

And somedays I pray for silence
And somedays I pray for soul
Somedays I just pray to the God of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N Roll.

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be

There's just one and only
The one and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires burning

As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it

That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact

And I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better then I do it with you

So long
So long
And I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, no, no I won't do...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just wont do that
But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that!
Oh I can do that!
Will you hold me sacred?
Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh oh now i can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?
Now I can do that
Oh now I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot! (HOT)?
Will you take me places I've never known?
Now I can do that
Oh, oh now I can do that!
After a while to forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that its time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory
I've been around
It'll all turn to dust
And we'll all fall down
And sooner or later you'll be screwing around
I won't do that!
No, I won't do that!
Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that"

7,Culture Beat,Mr Vain,1993,"Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane
He'd say: I know what I want
and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain

Call me Raider call me Wrong
Call me insane call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like
As long as you call me time and again
Feel the presence of the aura
of the man none to compare
Loveless dying
For a chance just to touch a hand
or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge that makes them
want to lose themselves to the debonair one
Hold me back the simple fact is
that i'm all that and i'm always near
one sexy can't perplex me now
You know who's raw
as if you didn't know before
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you and then I want a little more

Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane
He'd say: I know what I want
and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain

Girls are all over the world
they hope and pray and die for men
Like me cause I'm the one
begotten son that breaks the mould
Get a look at male epitome
Style has never seen
That makes you want to grab and hold
and squeeze real tight
Whose gonna be the one to save
you from yourself
When you wanna take a bite
please oh baby please
You beg you want you say
You got to get some caught
Up in the charm that I laid on thick
And now there's nowhere
to run
just another fish to fit the
worm on the hook of my line
Yeah I keep many females
longing for a chance to win my heart
with S E X and plenty"
8,Bryan Adams,Please Forgive Me,1993,"It still feels like our first night together.
Feels like the first kiss
It's getting better baby
No one can better this.
Still holding on
You're still the one.
First time our eyes met

Same feeling I get
Only feels much stronger
I wanna love you longer
Do you still turn the fire on?

So if you're feeling lonely, don't
You're the only one I'll ever want
I only want to make it go
So if I love you a little more than I should

Please forgive me, if I need you like I do.
Please believe me, every word I say is true.
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you.
Still feels like our best times are together
Feels like the first touch
Still getting closer baby
Can't get closer enough
Still holding on

You're still number one
I remember the smell of your skin
I remember everything
I remember all your moves

I remember you yeah
I remember the nights, you know I still do.
So if you're feeling lonely, don't
You're the only one I'll ever want

Oh believe me, every word I say is true.
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you.
The one thing I'm sure of
Is the way we make love
The one thing I depend on
Is for us to stay strong
With every word and every breath I'm praying
That's why I'm saying...
Please forgive me, I know not what I do.
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you.
Don't deny me, this pain I'm going through.
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do.
Babe, believe it, every word I say is true.
Please forgive me, if I can't stop loving you.
No, believe me, I don't know what I do.
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you.
I can't stop loving you."

10,Billy Joel,The River of Dreams,1993,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Though the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night"

12,Soul Asylum,Runaway Train,1993,"Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blow torch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like the madman laughing at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
I run away but it always seems the same"
13,Duran Duran,Ordinary World,1993,"Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Still, I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well, now, pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away
But, I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
(Just blown away...)
Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
And I don't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Every world, is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world, is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world, is my world
Every world is my world"

16,Mariah Carey,Hero,1993,"There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth

That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself

And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone

Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong

Didn't think I'd come to this

With just a little kiss
I've come to close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again

Kinda late in the game
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me
Then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again

Hold me, hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me

Over, sideways and under

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here, it's crystal clear

Through an endless diamond sky

I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare

A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper, ""Baby, blind love is true""

That I don't wanna hurt no more
(And it's time, I'm walking babe)
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
(This is time for letting go)

Hanging on to the past
It only stands in our way
We had to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart
No, I don't wanna hurt no more

But baby don't you know
No I don't wanna hurt no more
(Too much talking babe)
So let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more

You are the candle, love's the flame
A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine
Till the end of time
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

With all my soul I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain
This taste of heaven so deep so true
I've found in you
So many reasons in so many ways
My life has just begun
Need you forever, I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

You came to me like the dawn through the night

Your wheels are turnin' but you're upside down
You say when he hits you, you don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive
Oh, is that what it is?

Red lights, gray morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim, it depends on who's around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts

You could lip synch to the talk shows
And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing

If I could stay, then the night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay, and the night would be enough

Faraway, so close, up with the static and the radio
With satellite television
You can go anywhere, Miami, New Orleans
London, Belfast and Berlin

And, if you listen, I can't call
And, if you jump, you just might fall
And, if you shout, I'll only hear you

If I could stay, then the night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay with the demons you drowned, stay with the spirit I found
Stay, and the night would be enough

Three O'clock in the morning, it's quiet, there's no one around
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel runs to ground, just the bang and the clatter
As an angel hits the ground"

But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong.
The fear of pity is always awake.
But infinite sympathy completely gone.
It's the windows, the doors, the passageway to the truth.
Oh my god, it echoes the mind.
In total recall as wild as the deuce.
It's so deceiving is the clouded heart.
So superficial is the open wound.
I caress the infinite light.

There are always two sides to every story

Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town
Where death waits in the darkness
With a weapon to cut some stranger down
Sleeping with an empty bottle

He's a sad and an empty hearted man
All he needs is a job
And a little respect
So, he can get out while he can

We always need to hear both sides of the story
Both sides of the story

A neighborhood peace is shattered
It's the middle of the night
Young faces hide in the shadows
While they watch their mother and father fight

He says she's been unfaithful
She says her love for him has gone
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says
""Looks like it's just us from now on""

We always need to hear both sides of the story
We need to hear both sides of the story

And the lights are all on
The world is watching now
People looking for truth
We must not fail them now

Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
'Til you hear both sides
No, no, no, no

Here we are all gathered
In what seems to be the center of the storm
Neighbors once friendly
Now stand each side of the line that has been drawn

They've been fighting here for years
But, now there's killing on the streets
While small coffins are lined up sadly
Now united in defeat

We always need to hear both sides of the story

We must not fail them now

Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here

Finds himself within a different world
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder
Throws him up against the wall

If I didn't have this gun
'Cos without it, I don't get it
And that's why I carry one

60,Madonna,Rain,1993,"I feel it, it's coming

Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real

Rain is what this thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

When you looked into my eyes
And you said, ""Goodbye""
Could you see my tears when I turned the other way
Did you hear me say

""I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky""
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
Till I feel your

Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say, never go away

Waiting is the hardest thing
 (It's strange I feel like I've known you before)
I tell myself that if I believe in you
In the dream of you
 (I want to understand you more and more and more)
With all my heart and all my soul

(When I'm with you I feel like a magical child)
That by sheer force of will, I will raise you from the ground
(Everything is strange)
And without a sound you'll appear
(Everything is wild)
And surrender to me, to love

Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain, I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like

62,Toni Braxton,Another Sad Love Song,1993,"Baby, since you've been gone
I've been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me, I guess I'm all messed up, now baby

As soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on, on the radio
And there you are baby once again

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow it doesn't let go
Or shake me and it's all because of you

Since you've been gone
I keep think about you, baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough, yeah

As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again, ooh darlin'
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow, it doesn't let go
Or shake me, ooh baby

Here comes the strings then somebody sings
Only takes a beat and then it starts killin' me, darlin'
Only takes one note, I tell you from that radio
It's just another lonely love song

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow, it doesn't let go
Or shake me and it's all because of you
It's a sad, it's a sad
It's a sad, sad love song
And it's all because of you

63,Arrested Development,Mr Wendal,1993,"Here have a dollar
In fact now brotherman, here have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you

Be strong, serve God only
Know that if you do, beautiful Heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate

Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name 'cuz he's a no one
Never thought twice about spending on an old bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one

Now that I know 'em, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all their money on big colleges
Still most of you come out confused

Go ahead Mr. Wendal
Go ahead Mr. Wendal

Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think he's dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum

His only worries are sickness and occasional harassment
By the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him but I just saw him
Eat off the food we waste

Civilization, are we really civilized?
Yes or no, who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent man could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge

Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
It's not his fault when we're goin' too far and we got too far
'Cuz on him we walk

Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh but not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize now that all in all we stand tall
Go ahead Mr. Wendal

Mr. Wendal
Mr. Wendal
Mr. Wendal"
64,Taylor Dayne,Can't Get Enough of Your Love,1993,"I've heard people say that
Too much of anything
Is not good for you baby
But I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved
Shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me
Like it's ever, ever enough
It's just not enough

My darling, I, can't get enough of your love babe
I don't know I don't know I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love babe

Oh some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
It's like the more you give the more I want
And baby that's no lie, oh no babe

Tell me what can I say
What am I gonna do
How should I feel, when everything is you you you
What kind of love is this
That you've given me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet
All I know is every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing

If I could make you see
And make you understand
Your love for me is all I need
and more than I can stand
Oh well babe

How can I explain
All the things I feel
You've given me so much
You're so unreal, unreal, unreal
Still I keep loving you
More and more each time
What am I gonna do
Cause you've blown my mind
I get the same old feeling
Every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing

Signed with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you was created for you

Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces

Ahh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime to come undone
Now we'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone

Who do you need?
Who do you love?
When you come undone

Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Chill, is it something real?
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers

Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces

Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright to come undone
Now we'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

67,Green Jelly,Three Little Pigs,1993,"Why don't you sit right back?
And I, I may tell you a tale
A tale of three little pigs
And a big, bad wolf

Well, the first little piggy, well, he was kinda hick
He spent most of his days just a dreamin' of the city
And then one day, he bought a guitar
He moved to Hollywood to become a star

But living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city
Built his house out of straw, what a pity
And then one day, jammin' on some chords
Along came the wolf, knocking on his door

Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin
Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin

Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in

Well, the second little piggy, well, he was kinda stoked
He spent most of his day just in ganja smokin'
Huffin' and a puffin' down on Venice Beach
Getting paid money for religious speech

He built his shelter from what he garbage picked
Mostly made up of old cans and sticks
Then one day he was cranking out Bob Marley
And along came the wolf on his big, bad Harley

Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin
Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin

Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in

Well, the third little piggy, the grade A student
His daddy was a rock star named Pig Nugent
Earned his Masters Degree from Harvard College
Built his house from his architect knowledge

A tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills
Daddy's rock stardom, paid for the bills
And then one day came the old house smasher
The big, bad wolf, the little piggy slasher

Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin
Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin

Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in

Well, the big bad wolf
Well, he huffed and he puffed, all that he could
And low and behold the little piggy's house stood
""It's made out of concrete"", the little piggy shouted
The wolf just frowned, as he pouted

So, they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would
They sent out Rambo just as fast as they could
Yo, wolf-face, I'm your worst nightmare
Your ass is mine

Well, the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see
So, that's to end the story for you and me
If you still give a listen, you just may
Hear a big wolf or little piggy say

Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin
Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin

Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in

And the moral of the story is
A band with no talent can easily amuse
Idiots with a stupid, puppet show"

ah-ah, ah-ah-yeah, ah-ah-hah

Talkin' 'bout them times when I was by myself,
I would always be lookin' for somebody else
But as time went on I had a talk with my mind,
friends like you and you I gotta leave behind

And so, you call me your friend but you only want my gifts
And I'll never see you if I had no loot,
I'll never see them
I'm just glad I know the truth
and I'm payin' my own bills
and I'll never ever depend on you

Friends and enemies around me everyday,
I can't believe half the things they say
Takin' me for granted givin' no credit at all,
I'll just keep bouncin' like a bouncin' ball
Everybody seems to disappear on me,
can't trust no one as far as I can see
If I could be that fly that's on the wall, listenin' to my friends talk about it all

You call me your friend
but you only want my gifts
And I'll never see you if I had no loot,
I'll never see them
I'm just glad I know the truth
and I'm payin' my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you,
Sons Of Soul, y'all

I don't mean to step on nobody's foot, but ah -

When I need somebody there's nobody to call
When they need me,
my phone rings off the wall
But these are my friends
and that so what they say
Constantly takin' from me everyday, you say

You call me your friend
but you only want my gifts
And I'll never see you if I had no loot,
I'll never see them
I'm just glad I know the truth

If I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide
Will you be there for me, when I need someone to hold

I just need a little time, before I invest my love
Don't walk away boy, my love won't hurt you

Holding you right by my side
But the mornin' always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I close the door to keep my love within

If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it
I never showed you my love

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I close the door to keep my love within

Surely we must be in sight, of the dream we long to live
If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone
Straight on back to me

All I do each night is pray
Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday
All I do each night is think, of all the times
I close the door to keep my love within

you were so brutal
You turned the heat on in the afternoon
Get so excited,
get so addicted
You had me eating from your golden spoon

I know it goes against the grain
As the plane touched down
I got movies of you
Running through my fevered brain

I can't give her up
I really love my sweet thing,
I can't give her up

I was your ever-present love-sick fool
You turned the heat off
and left me standing
Freezing by your swimming pool

I can't give it up
I can't give it up
I can't give it up

Can't just walk away

Why there are tears

But you couldn't make my day (hey!)
I'm rocking and you're yawning
But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made
and played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the Grill town Ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop

You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground
Being lowdown
I do the showdown with any little ho' 'round (NO!)
I wanna know who you're believing
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheating
You said I know you're mister O.P.P man
You P.P man
Won't only see me man
You should've know that I ain't hitting the step
That I was with it a bit
Not to consider the rep (Heck!)
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty By Nature
Not cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark

You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today

There's many hungry Hip Hoppers
One reason Hip Hop's the top today
Swerve what you heard
Cause I ain't baling no hay
Ain't chopping no crop
But still growing every day

Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Ill town
Drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns
Beat downs are found
Don't know me! Don't come around!

Tippy tippy pause
Tippy tippy pause
Some start creepin' up, I eat 'em up
Their styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That's the way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitty's purr
Now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof
