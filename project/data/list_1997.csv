1,Elton John,Candle in the Wind '97,1997,"Goodbye, Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Goodbye, Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did"
2,P Diddy & Faith Evans,I'll Be Missing You,1997,"Yeah, this right here
Goes out to everyone
That has lost
Someone or that
Truly loved
Check it out

Seems like yesterday
We used
To rock the show
I laced the track
You locked the flow
So far from hangin' on
The block for dough
Notorius
They got to know that
Life ain't always
What it seem to be
Words can't express
What you mean to me
Even though you're gone
We still a team
Thru your family
I'll fulfill your dreams
In the future can't wait
To see if you'll open up
The gates for me
Reminisce
Sometime the night
They took my friend
Try to black it out
But it plays again
When it's real feelings
Hard to conceal
Can't imagine
All the pain I feel
Give anything to hear
Half your breath
I know you still livin'
Your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Everytime I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

(We miss you, Big)

It's kinda hard
Wit you not around
Know you in heaven
Smilin' down
Watching us
While
We pray for you
Everyday
We pray for you
Till the day
We meet again
In my heart is where
I keep you friend
Memories
Give me the strength
I need to proceed
Strength
I need to believe
My thoughts, Big
I just can't define
Wish I could turn back
The hands of time
Us and the six shop
For new clothes
And kicks
You and me
Takin' flics
Makin' hits
Stages
They receive you on
Still can't believe
You're gone
Give anything to hear
Half your breath
I know you still livin'
Your life after death

Somebody tell me why

One black morning
When this life is over
I know
I'll see your face

Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day

Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day

Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day

(We miss you)"
3,Hanson,Mmmbop,1997,"You have so many relationships in this life
Only one of two will last
You're going through all this pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
And they're gone so fast
So hold on to the ones that really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
When you get old and start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care
Can you tell me who will still care

Can you tell me? You say you can but you don't know.

Can you tell me? You say you can but you don't know."
4,No Doubt,Don't Speak,1997,"You and me
We used to be together
Every day together always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end
It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real
Well I don't want to know
Don't speak

I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories

They can be inviting
But some are altogether mighty frightening
As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands I sit and cry
Don't speak

I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining

Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
(no, no, no) Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

It's all ending
I gotta stop pretending who we are
You and me

I can see us dying ... are we?
Don't speak
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

(No, no) Don't speak
I know what you're thinking
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

6,R Kelly,I Believe I Can Fly,1997,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it!
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and i fly away
I believe I can soar
you see us running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of us

If I can see it,(yeah) then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly

I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day

spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see us running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
hey'Cos I believe in you
oh...
If I can see it, then we can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door

bright light into sight tight
camera zoom on the impending doom
but then like boom

with a quickness talk with the witnesses
hypnotizer neuralyzer
vivid memories turn to fantasies

9,Elton John,Something About the Way You look Tonight,1997,"There was a time I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me I was feeling like a cloud across the sun
I need to tell you how you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight you just shine like a beacon on the bay
And I can't explain but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away it's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away the way you look tonight

With you smile, you pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty I'm speechless and I don't know where to start
And I can't explain but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away it's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away the way you look tonight
And I can't explain but it's something about the way you look tonight

Oh takes my breath away it's that feeling I get about you, deep inside

And I can't describe but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away the way you look tonight

How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?

16,The Backstreet Boys,As Long As You Love Me,1997,We do not have the lyrics for As Long as You Love Me (Originally Performed by Backstreet Boys) [Karaoke Version] yet.
17,The Cardigans,Lovefool,1997,"Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know
And maybe there is nothing
That I can do to make you do

Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

So I cry, and I pray and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me

So I cried, and I begged for you to

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you

Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay

Reason will not reach a solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, I pray and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me

So I cried, and I begged for you to

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you
Anything but you

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
I know that you need me
I can't care about anything but you"

Pieces of you
you were meant for me
i hear the clock, it's six a.m. / i feel so far from where i've been / got my eggs and my pancakes too / got my maple syrup, everything but you

break the yolks, make a smiley face / i kinda like it in my brand new place / i wipe the spots off of the mirror / don't leave the keys in the door / never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause

dreams last so long / even after you're gone / i know you love me / and soon you will see / you were meant for me / and i was meant for you

called my momma, she was out for a walk / consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk / picked up a paper, it was more bad news / more hearts being broken or people being used

put on my coat in the pouring rain / saw a movie it just wasn't the same / 'cause it was happy and i was sad / it made me miss you oh so bad

dreams last so long / even after you're gone / i know you love me / and soon you will see / you were meant for me / and i was meant for you

go about my business, i'm doing fine / besides, what would i say if i had you on the line / same old story, not much to say / hearts are broken every day

brush my teeth and put the cap back on / i know you hate it when i leave the light on / i pick a book up / turn the sheets down / take a deep breath and a good look around

put on my pj's and hop into bed / i'm half alive but i feel mostly dead / i try and tell myself it'll all be alright / i just shouldn't think anymore tonight

dreams last so long / even after you're gone / i know you love me / and soon you will see / you were meant for me / and i was meant for you"

20,Savage Garden,I Want You,1997,"Anytime, I need to see your face, I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place, where your crystal mind and
Magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola

I don't need to try to explain, I just hold on tight
And if it happens again, I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips
And the face of the human cannonball
That I need to, I want to

Come stand, a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you

Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But, oh, I'd die to find out
Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But, oh I gotta to find out

I'm the kind of person, who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for
But a look, and then a smell of perfume
It's like, I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for

Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction of a lover and a mate
But the time of talking, using symbols, using words
Can be likened to a deep sea diver
Who is swimming with a raincoat

Come stand, a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you

Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But, oh, I'd die to find out
Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But, oh I gotta to find out

Anytime, I need to see your face I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place where your crystal mind and
Magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola

I don't need to try to explain, I just hold on tight
And if it happens again, I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips
And the face of the human cannonball
That I need to, I want to

Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you
But, oh, I'd die to find out
Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you
But, oh I gotta to find out

So can we find out?

Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you
But, oh, I gotta to find out
Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you
But, oh I gotta to find out

Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you

21,Meredith Brooks,Bitch,1997,"I hate the world today
You're so good to me
I know but I can't change

Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet

Yesterday I cried
You must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand
How you'd be so confused

I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed

I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it
Any other way

So take me as I am, this may mean
You'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that

When I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed

I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it
Any other way

Just when you think, you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed

I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it
Any other way

I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover

I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it
Any other way"

Evita
Don't Cry For Me Argentina
(Eva:)
It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Chorus:

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired

They are illusions
They are not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina

(chorus)

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you.
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true"
23,White Town,Your Woman,1997,"Just tell me what you've got to say to me
I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth
It comes as no surprise at all you see
So cut the crap and tell me that we're through

Now I know your heart, I know your mind
You don't even know you're bein' unkind
So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways
Just use me up and then you walk away
Boy, you can't play me that way

Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

When I saw my best friend yesterday
She said she never liked you from the start
Well me, I wish that I could claim the same
But you always knew you held my heart

And you're such a charming, handsome man
Now I think I finally understand
Is it in your genes? I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way?

Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

Well I guess what they say is true
I could never spend my life with a man like you

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman"

You make me, you make me

Leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Before anything became between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you

And how you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do

Leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
And what's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do, should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it why all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight but the feeling's just too strong

We started out as friends
It's funny how from simple things
The best things begin

This time it's different
Ta ra ra ra
It's all because of you
Ta ra ra ra
It's better than it's ever been
'Cause we can talk it through

My favorite line was
Can I call you sometime?
It's all you had to say
To take my breath away

This is it, oh, I finally found someone

I finally found the one
To be with every night

It's just got to be you

Someone

Did I keep you waiting?
I didn't mind
I apologize
Baby, that's fine
I would wait forever just to know
You were mine

You know, I love your hair
Are you sure it looks right
I love what you wear
Isn't it too tight?
You're exceptional
I can't wait for the rest of my life

32,Coolio,C U When U Get There,1997,"Now I've seen places and faces and things
You ain't never thought about thinking
If you ain't peek then you must be drinking and smokin'
Pretending not to lookin' but you're brokin' let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamika around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny

But who's the dummy 'cos, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother got replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya I know I can't trust ya
'Cos my crew is rollin' hummers and your crew is rollin' dust's
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
I guess that's just the way it goes I ain't trying preach
I believe I can reach but your mind ain't prepared

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

More temptation and faith I guess we livin' for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody getting lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
'Cos it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin'
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big horse
Someone's gotta run a little faster 'cos we gotta lay the struggle

I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
And if everybody's a sinner then everybody could be a winner
No matter you rag collar deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time somebody up there still love us
I'm a scuff and struggle and y'all I'm breathless and weak
I just strive my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there when you wit the sound bumpin'

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin'
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that you busy trying stack
And keep them from the Jones's is taking advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut to describe when
It's something wrong and we desire

So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous
I know time seems right and the problems seem endless
But at times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you fell you're out the game then you need to get back in it
'Cos nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight barrel
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there"

She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation

She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break

It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again

Said how do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place
Where you said?

Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby

Goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right

And when the plane came in
She said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive

But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test

Slide up around the belly face
Down on the mattress one
And you hold me and we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now

Feel myself head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

35,Jewel,Foolish Games,1997,"You took your coat off and stood in the rain,
You're always crazy like that.
And I watched from my window,
Always felt I was outside looking in on you.
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair,
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care.
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather.

Well in case you failed to notice,
In case you failed to see,
This is my heart bleeding before you,
This is me down on my knees, and...

These foolish games are tearing me apart,
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart.
You're breaking my heart.

You're always brilliant in the morning,
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee.
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you.
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar.

You'd teach me of honest things,
Things that were daring, things that were clean.
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.
I hid my soiled hands behind my back.
Somewhere along the line, I must have gone
Off track with you.

Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else,
Somebody who gave a damn,
Somebody more like myself.

These foolish games are tearing me,
You're tearing me,
You're tearing me apart,
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart.
You're breaking my heart.

You took your coat off,
Stood in the rain,
You're always crazy like that."

Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach
Will we ever live in peace? 'Cause those that can't do, often have to
No those that can't do, often have to preach

Armour plated suits and ties

When springtime makes it's way here

Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare

When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same
Remember the nights when we closed our eyes

And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time
Anytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain

Reminiscing our love as I watch 4 seasons change
In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it's way here

Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare

When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same
This loneliness has crushed my heart
Please let me love again
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain

Or 4 seasons will bring the loneliness again
In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it's way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare
When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same
Remember the warmth of days gone by"
44,Savage Garden,To the Moon & Back,1997,"She's taking her time making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles
And the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one

They're saying
Mama never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come
(and she'll say to him)

She's saying
I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?

Ooh-ooh
She can't remember a time when she felt needed
If love was red then she was color-blind
All her friends they've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined

She's saying
Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for
So baby gonna take a dive and
push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars
(What a pleasant dream)

Just saying
I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we belong

Take shelter on my front porch

I will do laundry if you pay all the bills

Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie son?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the Cowboys gone?

Why don't you stay the evening
Kick back and watch the TV
And I'll fix a little somethin' to eat?
Oh I know your back hurts from working on the tractor
How do you take your coffee my sweet?
I will raise the children if you pay all the bills?

But you don't even notice me

Say our goodbyes

We finally sold the Chevy
When we had another baby
And you took that job in Tennessee
You made friends at the farm
And you joined them at the bar
Almost every single day of the week
I will wash the dishes while you go have a beer

Where is my prairie son?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the Cowboys gone?
Where is my Marlboro Man?
Where is my shiny gun?
Where is my lonely ranger?

48,Bee Gees,Alone,1997,"I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man, I had a master plan
But I was alone

I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh, what a night it's been and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone

And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Always end up alone, always end up alone

So I play, I'll wait
'Cause you know that love takes time
We came so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

Since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone

I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
'Cause I know it isn't Heaven, is it love or hate?
Am I the subject of the pain and I the stranger in the rain?
I am alone

And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told

So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We came so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told

So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We came so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home"

There they go with they assumpitons
Slaverys over let us have somethin'
Why you wanna pull me over?
Cuz I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song

And leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
They harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
The hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay
Cuz I'm gonna work for life
So he can see another day

What are you looking for
It's got to be hard core
Must be some kind of nouveau riche

Hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light
Of an already faded prima Donna

So get ready, 'cause I want everybody to say this with me
Rock the house, rock the house, rock the house

Now I cold rock a party in a B-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, you get that booty scarred, I'm a veteran
Which means that I've been in the game too long
Since the days of Paper Thin way back when I've been putting it

Down ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of
The M I C, I go for broke, never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request, you like the rhyme
Bite if you dare, I get the paper so I don't care, fly that's me

The epitome of what a real MC is supposed to be, fucking you up
Every time that I drop, fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well and if you take a look
lt ain't hard to tell that I

Now I cold rock a party in a B-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance

Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
lt's hard to believe I shall prevail 'cause I'm next to none
'Cause I'm claiming no set, don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from but I'm resting in Studio City

For the fun, if you don't understand just say you don't, nah
And don't wait for me to explain 'cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best, west to east
See east to west, ready or not I have arrived and I'm live

Showing an MC how to survive 'cause it's crazy how I
Get you captured with my tactics, I got many witnesses
That can back this ruff necks from New York to L.A.
Been down with me since Poor George

It's '96 it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
Make the ill type moves, I guide the best and ride it well

I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Get out my shit, please let me be, I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that, trying to get over
Like a fat rat but I understand I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop, it goes on, on, on, on

You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver, chillin with
A pina colada, kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I gotta
Lot of gear from everywhere that I'd like to share, yeah right

But I'd rather do Kani, don't ask why!  5001, my son gets shit done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you
You betta get down with your real crew, 'cause I ride the beat
And I ride it well and if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

80,The Wallflowers,One Headlight,1997,"So long ago I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste
She always had a pretty face
I wondered why she hung around this place

Hey, come on try a little, nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than in the middle
But me and Cinderella we put it all together
We can drive it home with one headlight

She said it's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

And I seen the sign up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all is good and nothingness is dead
Run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

Hey, come on try a little, nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than in the middle
But me and Cinderella we put it all together
We can drive it home with one headlight

Well this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine but the engine doesn't turn
Well it smells of cheap wine and cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn

I'm so alone and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
These city walls of dying dreams
I think her death it must be killing me

Hey, hey, hey! Come on try a little, nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than in the middle
But me and Cinderella we put it all together
We can drive it home with one headlight"

Destination Anywhere
Midnight In Chelsea
J. Bon Jovi, Dave Stewart 

The kids 'round here look just like sticks 
They trade old licks with a beat up six 
I just smile and catch the groove 

Gothic girls all dress in black 
Serious as heart attacks 
It takes a little bit of getting used to 

The old man with the whiskey stains 
Lost the night forgot his name 
His poor wife will sleep alone again 
And it ain't hard to understand 
Why she's holding on to her own hand 

Chorus: 
It's midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea 
No one's asking me for favors 
No one's looking for a savoir 
They're too busy saving me 

(Repeat Chorus) 

I've seen a lone,sloane ranger drive 
seems her chauffeur took a dive 
And sold her secrets to the sun 
And later in a magazine 
I finally figured what it means 
To be a saint, not a queen 

Two lustful lovers catch a spark 
And chase their shadows in the dark 
Someone's getting off tonight 
Of a big red bus that's packed so tight 
It disappears in a trail of light 
Somewhere someone's dreaming baby it's all right... 

Chorus: 
It's midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea 
No one's asking me for favors 
No one's looking for a savoir 
They're too busy saving me 
Midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea 
No one's pinned dreams on me 
No one's asking me to bleed 
I'm the man I want to be 
When Chelsea girls sing... 

It's morning when I go to sleep 
In the distant dawn a church bell rings 
Another day is coming on 
A baby's born, an old man dies 
Somewhere young lovers kiss good-bye 
I leave my soul and just move on 
And wish that I was there to sing this song 

Chorus: 
It's midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea 
No one's asking me for favors 
No one's looking for a savoir 
They're too busy saving me 

It's midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea 
No one's pinned dreams on me 
No one's asking me to bleed 
I'm the man I want to be 
The man I want to be,the man I want to be

Secret Garden
She'll let you in her house
If you come knockin' late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right
If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides

She'll let you in her car
To go drivin' round
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That'll bring you down
She'll let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice

You've gone a million miles
How far'd you get
To that place where you can't remember
And you can't forget

She'll lead you down a path
There'll be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
She'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away"
