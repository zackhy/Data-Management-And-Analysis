3,The Rolling Stones,Honky Tonk Woman,1969,"I met a gin soaked, bar-room queen in memphis,
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride.
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
cause I just cant seem to drink you off my mind.

Its the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

I laid a divorcee in new york city,
I had to put up some kind of a fight.
The lady then she covered me with roses,
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind.

Its the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

5,Elvis Presley,Suspicious Minds,1969,"We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real
I'm crying

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Oh let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die

When honey, you know
I've never lied to you
Mmm yeah, yeah

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Don't you know I'm caught in a trap

6,The Beatles,Come Together,1969,"Here come old flattop, he come grooving up slowly

He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, ""I know you, you know me.""
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Come together right now over me

He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease

Come together right now over me

(Right!
Come, oh, come, come, come.)

He roller-coaster, he got early warning
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, ""One and one, and one is three.""
Got to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to see

Come together right now over me

9,Elvis Presley,In the Ghetto,1969,"As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries"
10,The Beatles,The Ballad of John & Yoko,1969,"Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said
""You've got to go back""
You know, they didn't even give us a chance
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
You can make it okay
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
So from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said
""Say, what you doing in bed?""
I said, ""We're only trying to get us some peace""
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
Oh boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul
Think!
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
Newspapers said
""She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag""
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press
Said, ""We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back""
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me"
11,Creedence Clearwater Revival,Proud Mary,1969,"Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

12,The Beatles,Something,1969,"Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me, will my love grow?
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how"
13,Tommy Roe,Dizzy,1969,"Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy

First time that I saw you, girl
I knew that I just had to make you mine
But it's so hard to talk to you
With fellas hanging 'round you all the time
I want you for my sweet pet
But you keep playing hard to get
I'm going around in circles all the time

Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy

I finally got to talk to you
And I told you just exactly how I felt
Then I held you close to me
And kissed you and my heart began to melt
Girl, you've got control on me
'Cause I'm so dizzy I can't see
I need to call a doctor for some help

Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool it never ends
And it's you girl making it spin
You're making me dizzy

Hope you are quite prepared to die

So great an area of land
That from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed
To the South and the North Americas with ease
In their ships with painted sails
To the East, Africa was a neighbour
Across a short strait of sea miles
The great Egyptian age is but a remnant
Of The Atlantian culture
The antediluvian kings colonised the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends, from all lands, were from far Atlantis
Knowing her fate
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth
On board were the Twelve
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician
And the other so-called Gods of our legends
Though Gods they were
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice, and let us sing, and dance
And ring in the new
Hail, Atlantis!

And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Where the New York City winters aren't bleedin' me
Leadin' me goin' home

And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down or cut him
'Til he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains

Let me remember things I love.
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite,
Walkin' along the river road at night,
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight.

I can hear the bullfrog callin' me, oh.
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree.
Love to kick my feet 'way down the shallow water,
Shoo fly, dragonfly, get back t'mother.
Pick up a flat rock; skip it across Green River.
Well!

Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, oh,
With flat-car riders and cross-tie walkers.
Old Cody, Junior took me over,
Said, ""You're gonna find the world is smold'rin',
And if you get lost, come on home to Green River.""

Over by the courthouse
They're starting to unwind.

Trying to bring you up.
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp.

Down on the corner,
Out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet.

Rooster hits the washboard
And people just got to smile
Blinky, thumps the gut bass

And solos for a while.
Poorboy twangs the rhythm out
On his kalamazoo.

Willy goes into a dance
And doubles on kazoo.
Down on the corner,
Out in the street

Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet.
Down on the corner,

Out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet.

You don't need a penny
Just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel,
Won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner
There's a happy noise.
People come from all around
To watch the magic boy.
Down on the corner,

Out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet.
Down on the corner,
Out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet.
Down on the corner,

Bring a nickel, tap your feet."
27,Tammy Wynette,Stand By Your Man,1969,"Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
Giving all your love to just one man
You have bad times, and you have good times
Doing things that you don't understand

But if you love him, you'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him, oh be proud of him
'Cause after all, he's just a man

Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man"

So on we go
His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there

For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another

It's a long, long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there
Why not share

And the load
Doesn't weigh me down at all

When we could feel
The wheel of life turn our way
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday
I had a dream so did you life
Was warm and love was true
Two kids who followed all the rules
Yester folls and now

Were just a cruel
And foolish game we used to play

I feel lost I feel sad with nothing but
The memory of yester love and now

Were just a cruel
And foolish game we had to play

He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right.

And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said, ""My name is Sue! How do you do?
Now you're gonna die""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him curse
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""

He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But you ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

What could I do? Yeah what could I do?
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George anything but Sue I still hate that name"

I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way

Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the time, I won't have to say

Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

43,Peter Sarstedt,Where Do You Go to My Lovely?,1969,"You talk like Marlène Dietrich
And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire
Your clothes are all made by Balmain
And there's diamonds and pearls in your hair, yes there are

You live in a fancy apartment
Off the Boulevard Saint-Michel
Where you keep your Rolling Stones records
And a friend of Sacha Distel, yes you do

But where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

I've seen all your qualifications
You got from the Sorbonne
And the painting you stole from Picasso
Your loveliness goes on and on, yes it does

When you go on your summer vacation you go to Juan-les-Pins
With your carefully designed topless swimsuit
You get an even sun tan, on your back and on your legs

When the snow falls you're found in Saint Moritz
With the others of the jet-set
And you sip your Napoleon brandy
But you never get your lips wet, no you don't

But where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
Won't you tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

Your name, it is heard in high places
You know the Aga Khan
He sent you a racehorse for Christmas
And you keep it just for fun, for a laugh ahaha

They say that when you get married
It'll be to a millionaire
But they don't realise where you came from
And I wonder if they really care or give a damn

Where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

I remember the back streets of Naples
Two children begging in rags
Both touched with a burning ambition
To shake off their lowly born tags, and they try
So look into my face, Marie-Claire
And remember just who you are
Then go and forget me forever
But I know you still bear the scar deep inside, yes you do
I know where you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
I know the thoughts that surround you
Cause I can look inside your head"
44,Mary Hopkin,Goodbye,1969,"Please don't make me wait too late tomorrow comes
And I will not be late
Late to day when it becomes tomorrow I will
Leave to go a-way

Goodbye... Goodbye...
Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye

Songs that lingered on my lips excite me now
And linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door I'll leave them for
The one who waits behind

Goodbye... Goodbye...
Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye

Far away my lover sings a lonely song
And calls me to her side
When a song of lonely love invites me on
I must go to her side

Goodbye... Goodbye...
Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye"
45,Frank Sinatra,My Way,1969,"And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've travelled each and every highway
and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each chartered course
Each careful step along the by-way
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times
I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all

And I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed, and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing

And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way

""Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way""
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes, it was my way"

But I was proud to go
And do my patriotic chore

I'm not the man I used to be
Oh, Ruby I still need some company


It's hard to love a man
Whose legs are bent and paralyzed
That my wants and needs of a woman of your age

Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

She's leaving now cause
I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it

And put her in the ground
Oh Ruby

Oh Ruby for God's sake turn around"

From Soho down to Brighton

In any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean

Plays by intuition
The digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's
Got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it? I don't know
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions
Can't hear no buzzers and bells
Don't see no lights a flashing
Plays by sense of smell

Always gets a replay
Never see him fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was the bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest

He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kind
Sure plays a mean pinball"

Deep inside of me.
Girl you just don't realize
What you do to me.

When you hold me in your arms so tight,
You let me know everything's alright.

Lips are sweet as candy,
The taste stays on my mind.
Girl, you keep me thirsty
For another cup of wine!
I got it bad for you, girl,
But I don't need a cure.
I'll just stay addicted,
And hope I can endure!

All the good love, when we're all alone.
Keep it up, girl, yeah you turn me on.
