1,Whitney Houston,I Will Always Love You,1992,"If I should stay
I would only be in your way.

So I'll go, but I know

I'll think of you ev'ry step of the way.
And I will always love you.
I will always love you.

You, my darling you. Hmm.

Bittersweet memories
that is all I'm taking with me.

So, goodbye. Please, don't cry.

We both know I'm not what you, you need.
And I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of.
And I wish to you, joy and happiness.
But above all this, I wish you love.
And I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I, I will always love you.
You, darling, I love you.
Ooh, I'll always, I'll always love you."
2,Boyz II Men,End of the Road,1992,"Girl you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playing
With my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see

We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?

Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say good-bye?

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinning around and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time

Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

Can you love me again like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me, don't let me down

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night when you just hurt me
And just run out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night
Just like you did baby but that's all right
Hey, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
'Coz you just won't come back to me
Will you? Just come back to me
Lonely
Lonely
Lonely
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me go
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you"

4,Eric Clapton,Tears in Heaven,1992,"Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven
Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way
Through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven
Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you begging please
Begging please
Beyond the door
There's peace, I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven"
5,Mr Big,To Be With You,1992,"Hold on little girl
Show me what he's done to you
Stand up little girl
A broken heart can't be that bad

When it's through, it's through
Fate will twist the both of you
So come on baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

Build up your confidence
So you can be on top for once
Wake up, who cares about
Little boys that talk too much

I've seen it all go down
Your game of love was all rained out
So come on baby, come on over
Let me be the one to hold you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

Why be alone when we can be together baby?
You can make my life worthwhile
I can make you start to smile

When it's through, it's through
Fate will twist the both of you
Come on baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues

Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel

Is the city I live in,
The city of Angel
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause
She's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause
She knows who I am

She kisses the windy

9,George Michael,Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me,1992,"I can't light
No more of your darkness
All my pictures
Seem to fade to black and white

I'm growing tired
And time stands still before me
Frozen here
On the ladder of my life

It's much too late
To save myself from falling
I took a chance
And changed your way of life

But you misread

My meaning when I met you
Closed the door
And left me blind by the light
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me
{Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!}

I can't find
Oh, the right romantic line
But see me once
And see the way I feel

Don't discard me, baby don't
Just because you think I mean you harm
Just because you think I mean you harm, oh
But these cuts I have (cuts I have)
They need love (they need love, they need love), to help them heal

Oh, don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh
Cause' losing everything is like the sun going down on me
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else that I see, yeah
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby, oh

10,Madonna,This Used to Be My Playground,1992,"This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say

Don't look back, keep your head held high
Don't ask them why because life is short
And before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask

This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say

No regrets but I wish that you were here with me
Well, then there's hope yet
I can see your face in our secret place
You're not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say

This used to be my playground
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy

This used to be our playground
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me

This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me"
11,Vanessa Williams,Save the Best For Last,1992,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face-to-face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

12,U2,One,1992,"Is it getting better?
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now?
You got someone to blame

You say, one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you baby if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One!

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus?
To the lepers in your head

Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothin' now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
Well we hurt each other then we do it again

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holdin' on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life, with each other
Sisters, brothers

One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

15,Billy Ray Cyrus,Achy Breaky Heart,1992,"You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes up when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone.

You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Oooh

You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
Or you can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff who's fist can tell my lips
He never really liked me anyway

Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

Say you trust someone
Why ya callin' all around
Think I've got some dip on the side

And you constantly in doubt

And you want to love 'em right
Got to get more lovin' about cha

When you know
That you're holdin' on too tight
Soon they will be leavin' without you

Say that you love someone
Why you callin' all my friends
Thinkin' I got somethin' to hide

Girl you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game

Give you so much of the feeling of the deck
That I'm dealing when I rub ya up and down
Yo Stylz kick it

Well, I know it's been a while
Since you heard a change in our style
So what I've come to do is kick you something fly and new
A change, different from the typical a bit more than regular
Not like the others original, 'cuz originality
And creativity add it up together equals the B.B.B. posse
Yeah, we've in the house, yo kick it

A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands

In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Babe, you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel

For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh babe, you're the one

Did we peak too soon? If the world is so green
Then why does it scream under a blue moon?
We wonder why the earth's sacrificed
For the price of its greatest treasure

What a giant step have we got what it takes
To carry the weight of this concept?
Or pass it by like a shot in the dark
Miss the mark with a sense of adventure

Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Drivin' with my baby to get her in the mood
She's dialin' through my radio and I'm ready to make my move
What she got ain't rock 'n' roll and it really blew my groove

It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me wanna scream
Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins
Turn it off, that ain't my scene
Well, I'm sorry, girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question

Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

Hey, all I wanna do is take a ride into the blue
Every time I wanna love you, I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick and tired of dancin' with this broom

I feel lucky today
Hey, look at that, man
Do you wanna get rocked?
Do you wanna get rocked?

Ho, it won't take you a minute
It won't take that long
So get on, get with it
Oh, come on everybody

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top, baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Do you wanna, do you wanna?

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top of it
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Love to rock your body, baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

Let's go all the way, let's do it night and day
Let's get out and play, rock the night away

33,Sir Mix-a-Lot,Baby Got Back,1992,"Oh, my, God Becky, look at her butt
It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends.
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her, because,
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?
I mean, her butt, is just so big
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She's just so, black

I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet,
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas (yeah) Fellas (yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (shake it) shake it (shake it)
Shake that healthy butt

Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (Yeah) Ladies (Yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (Yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back

Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin'
To do with my selection
Thirty six-twenty- four-thirty six
Ha ha, only if she's 5'3

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down,
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

35,Richard Marx,Hazard,1992,"My mother came to Hazard
When I was just seven
Even then the folks in town
Said with prejudiced eyes

That boy's not right, three years ago
When I came to know Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors
And the lies and saw the man inside

We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town

No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night
She went out walking alone
And never came home

Man with a badge came
Knocking next morning, here was I surrounded
By a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

I swear, I left her by the river
I swear, I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

I think about my life gone by
And how it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone

I swear, I left her by the river
I swear, I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town"
36,Michael Jackson,Heal the World,1992,"There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords
Into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me"

Well it comes at a hard hard price
You can't shut off the risk and the pain
Without losing the love that remains
We're all riders on this train

These are the words, I never said
This is the path, I'll never tread

These are the tears, the tears we shed
This is the fear, this is the dread
These are the contents of my head

And these are the years, that we have spent
And this is what they represent
This is how I feel, do you know how I feel?

Seemed a harmless little fuck

Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast

And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurtin', ooo, dropped wide open

69,Arrested Development,Tennessee,1992,"Lord, I've really been real stressed, down and out, losing ground.
Although I am black and proud, problems got me pessimistic.
Brothers and sisters keep messin' up, why does it have to be so damn tuff?
I don't know where I can go to let these ghosts out of my skull.
My grandma past my brother's gone, I never at once felt so alone.
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel, not just my spare tire.
(Home!) But Lord, I ask you,
(Home!) to be my guiding force and truth.
(Home!) For some strange reason it had to be,
(Home!) he guided me to Tennessee.

(Home!) Take me to another place, take me to another land.
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.
Take me to another place, take me to another land.
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.

Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talkin' to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyesburg and Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climb the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young. (Home)
Go back, from whence you came (Home)
My family tree, my family name (Home)
For some strange reason it had to be (Home)
He guided me to Tennessee. (Home)

(Home!) Take me to another place, take me to another land.
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.
Take me to another place, take me to another land.
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.

Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playin' ghetto games
I ask you, Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said, cuz I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

(Home!) Take me to another place, take me to another land.
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.
Take me to another place, take me to another land.
Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.
Oh, won't you let me, won't you help me,
won't you help me understand your plan.
Take me home, take me home, home, take me to another place.
Take me home, take me home, home, take me to another place."

If I could I would give you the world

Why can't we just let love decide?
Am I the weaker man because I understand

77,Shamen,Ebeneezer Goode,1992,"There's a guy in the place who's got a bittersweet face
And he goes by the name of Ebeneezer Goode
His friends call him 'Ezeer and he is the main geezer
And he'll vibe up the place like no other man could
He's refined, sublime, he makes you feel fine
Though very much maligned and misunderstood
But if you know 'Ezeer he's a real crowd pleaser
He's ever so good - he's Ebeneezer Goode
You can see that he's mischievous, mysterious and devious
As he circulates amongst the people in the place
But once you know he's fun, and something of a genius
He gives a grin that goes around from face to face to face
Backwards and then forwards, forwards and then backwards
'Eezer is the geezer who loves to muscle in
That's about the time the crowd all shout the name of 'Eezer
As he's kotcheled in the corner, laughing by the bass bin

Lovely ... Ya Ha Ha Ha
A Great Philospher once wrote...
Naughty Naughty, Very Naughty
Ha Ha Ha Ha

Ebeneezer Goode, leading light of the scene, know what I mean?
He created the vibe - He takes you for a ride as if by Design
The party ignites like it's comin' alive
He takes you to the top, shakes you all around
Then back down - you know as he gets mellow
Then as smooth as the groove that is making you move
He glides into your mind with a sunny ""Hello!""
A gentleman of leisure he's there for your pleasure
But go easy on old 'Ezeer he's the love you could lose
Extraordinary fellow, like Mr Punchinello
He's the kind of geezer who must never be abused
When you're in town and Ebeneezer is around
You can sense a presence in the sound of the crowd
He gets them all at it - the party starts rocking - the people get excited
It's time to shout LOUD!

78,Joe Public,Live & Learn,1992,"You've got to live and learn
You've got to live and learn
Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn

Here's a little story about life
Everybody that lives surely dies
A lot of people ask the questions why
Some people have to go through so much more
Before they really learn about life's score
The subject is not to be ignored (Kick it to ‘em, Joe)

I don't wanna be the one
To tell you how it's gotta be
Livin' is the only way

Before your bridges burn

Ah, yeah
Y'all, check it
Kick this one for the Public
Now break it down

There's so much wrong and negativity
Enough for the whole world to see
I know there's still a possibility
You raise a little kid, he turns out bold
It may be from the way you treat him cold
I guess that's how the story's told (Tell ‘em what it is)

(Large) If large is how ya livin'
Why you're livin' large, are you takin' what is given
To you, in the form of true experience
‘Cause if you're not your whole life could be spent
Doin' time for a crime you say you didn't even do
The only fool that you're foolin' is the fool that is you
Didn't even turn around to check and see if your bridge is burnin'
I guess it's true what they say that without livin' there's no learnin'

And this is from the J, the O, and the E

Mary, Mary, Mary, it's quite contrary
Yo', how did you earn your dough
You didn't finish school, you ain't got no job
But to the human eye it's pretty simple
You're always talkin' about what you want is respect
But never thinkin' about the little boy you neglect
Spendin' his formative years in a livin' hell
Not realizin' one day he'd end up in jail
Now on the other hand, there's Dan my man
Who planned a scam and I'll be damned
It was the ultimate flim flam
He was sayin' that it was easy as pie
But little did Dan know he was about to die

In anger, burning our world
Doomsday has come
And there is no place to hide away

The future is over
And there is no turning back
Fireflash in the night

Now reality
Holy war in the sky. . . .
Twilight of the gods
Insania's dead and gone

Another world was born
But the twilight soon will come
(Solo)
(Mike/Harmony both/Kai)
Fireflash in the night
Now reality
Holy war in the sky"
89,Annie Lennox,Walking On Broken Glass,1992,"Walkin' on, walkin' on broken glass
Walkin' on, walkin' on broken glass

You were the sweetest thing
That I ever knew
But I don't care for sugar, honey
If I can't have you

Since you've abandoned me
My whole life has crashed
Won't you pick the pieces up?
'Cause it feels just like I'm walkin' on broken glass

Walkin' on, walkin' on broken glass
Walkin' on, walkin' on broken glass

The sun's still shining in the big blue sky
But it don't mean nothing to me
Oh, let the rain come down
Let the wind blow through me

I'm livin' in an empty room
With all the windows smashed
And I've got so little left to lose
That it feels just like I'm walkin' on broken glass

Walkin' on, walkin' on broken glass

And if you're trying to cut me down
You know that I might bleed
'Cause if you try to cut me down
I know that you'll succeed

And if you want to hurt me
There's nothing left to fear
'Cause if you want to hurt me
You're doing really well, my dear

Now everyone of us is made to suffer
Everyone of us is made to weep
But we've been hurting one another
Now the pain has cut too deep

So take me from the wreckage
Save me from the blast
Lift me up and take me back
Don't let me keep on walkin'
I can't keep on walkin' on
I can't keep on walkin' on broken glass

Walkin' on, walkin' on broken glass
Walkin' on, walkin' on broken glass
Walkin' on, walkin' on broken glass

90,Simply Red,Stars,1992,"Anyone who ever held you
Would tell you the way I'm feeling
Anyone who ever wanted you
Would try to tell you what I feel inside

Was the feeling that you ain't faking
The only one you ever thought about
Wait a minute, can't you see

That I
Wanna fall from the stars
Straight into your arms

He's explaining the way I'm feeling
For all the jealousy I caused you
States the reason why I'm trying to hide
As for all the things you taught me
It sends my future into clearer dimensions

Wanna fall from the stars

Too many hearts are broken
A lover's promise never came with a maybe
So many words are left unspoken
The silent voices are driving me crazy
After all the pain you caused me
Making up could never be your intention
You'll never know how much you hurt me

Stay, can't you see

'Til I get your daughter I won't leave this town

In the beginning God made the sea
But on the 7th day he made me
He was tryin' to rest y'all
When He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar, cold gettin' down

I tried to bust a high note
But I bust a string
My God was worried
'Til he heard me sing

My name is Prince and I am funky
When it come to funk I am a junky
I know from righteous, I know from sin
I got two sides and they're both friends

Don't try to clock 'em, they're much too fast
If you try to stop 'em they kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When you hear my music you'll be havin' fun

That's when I gottcha
That's when you mine
To tell the truth
Tell me what's my line?

Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody
Do that, do that, somebody

My name is Prince, I don't wanna be king
'Cause I've seen the top and it's just a dream
Big cars and women and fancy clothes
Will save your face but it won't save your soul

I'm here to tell you that there's a better way
Would our Lord be happy if He came today?
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than you
But if you want to play with me, you better learn the rules

I won't leave this town

The funkier I be, the funkier I get, oh shit
Lickety split on the lyric, a new jack in the pulpit
Watch it deacon, your track is leakin'
What is this you're seekin'?
The syncopated rhymes are at their peak

When you jumped on my D I C K
That's the one thing that I don't play
The jock strap was too big for you anyway
You're just a simpleton, I'll bust you like a pimple, son
My star is too bright
Boy, I'll sink you like the ship, Poseidon Adventure

You're bumpin' dentures to be cocksure
There must be more coming from your mouth than manure
So with a flow and a spray, I say
""Hey, you must become a prince before you're king anyway""

Do that, do that somebody
Do that, do that somebody

It's time to get ig-ig-ignorant
Def be the beat that I'm rockin'
Yo so, come get a hit
And put your thinking cap on, you've been forewarned
I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin' in my cauldron

That means my nugget, sometimes I'm rugged
The style I posses be havin', the other brothers buggin'
And this is for those who oppose
To propose to overexpose disclose
Pose a threat to my brother

Like any other man makin' a stand
I'll be damned if I let you play this hand
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked
What do you expect to win when you're used to playing craps?

Do that, do that somebody
Do that, do that somebody

It's gettin' tricky, I mean it's a sticky situation
To resurrect a groove with feeling and give it this much affection
Passion flows and who knows what lurks in the gallows of my mind
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow

12 inches of non-stop sole
I'm on a roll with P, it's time for the show
So do that, do that somebody
Wave your hands in the air
This is a motherfucking party

While you're laying back I'm on the attack paddywhack
Give yourself a bone
This is my house and I'm prone
To layin' some chrome upside some motherfuckers dome
And I'm out

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only

My name is Prince
