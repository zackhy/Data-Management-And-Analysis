1,Stevie Wonder,I Just Called to Say I Love You,1984,"No new years's day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

Of my heart
Of my heart"
2,George Michael,Careless Whisper,1984,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again

Guilty feet have got no rhythm

Though it's easy to pretend

I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is that all you'll find
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
With or without your love
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever

But now, who's gonna dance with me?

Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again

Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
(Now that you're gone)
Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone)
Was what I did so wrong?
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?"
3,Prince,When Doves Cry,1984,"Dig if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling, can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when the doves cry

Touch if you will, my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

When doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry
Don't cry

Oh yeah all right, oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah

When doves cry, when doves cry
When doves cry

Ah, ah, ah, ooo
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ooo
When doves cry, don't cry
Darling don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry"
4,Cyndi Lauper,Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,1984,"I come home in the mornin' light
My Mother says,""When you gonna live your life right?""
Oh Mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My Father yells,""What you gonna do with your life?""
Oh Daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the workin' day is done
Girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun
  (Girls, they want)
(Wanna have fun)
(Girls wanna have)

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Is some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun

5,Tina Turner,What's Love Got to Do With It?,1984,"You must understand
That the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only that thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that

Oh whats love got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do with it
Who needs a heart
When a heart can be broken

It may seem to you
That I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase for it
But whatever the reason
You do it for me

Oh whats love got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do with it
Who needs a heart
When a heart can be broken

I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

What's love got to do, got do with it
What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken"
6,Band Aid,Do They Know It's Christmas?,1984,"It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time, it's hard
But when you're having fun

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dreaded fear
Where the only water flowing
Is a bitter sting of tears

And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
We'll, tonight, thank God, it's them
Instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Here's to you
Raise your glass for everyone
Here's to them
Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Feed the world
Feed the world

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time and
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time and
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time and

8,Wham!,Wake Me Up Before You Go Go,1984,"You put the boom-boom into my heart
You send my soul sky-high when your lovin' starts
Jitterbug into my brain
Goes bang-bang-bang till my feet do the same

But something's bugging me
Something ain't right
My best friend told me
What you did last night
You left me sleeping in my bed
I was dreaming
but I should've been with you instead.

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo

You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
You turned a bright spark into a flame
My beats per minute never been the same

'Cause you're my lady
I'm your fool
It makes me crazy
When you act so cruel
Come on baby
Let's not fight
We'll go dancing
Everything will be alright

Move in tight
We'll go dancing tomorrow night
It's cold out there
But it's warm in bed
They can dance
We'll stay home instead

9,Phil Collins,Against All Odds (Take a Look At Me Now),1984,"How can I just let you walk away,
Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Ooh, Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, sponsored links

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Now Take a look at me now
'Cause that's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've got to take
Take a look at me now"

Somehow I made it through

Pass outside my door

I can see it in your smile

And tell you time and time again
How much I care

Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart

16,Bruce Springsteen,Dancing in the Dark,1984,"I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
Just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, gimme just one look

You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark"
17,Cyndi Lauper,Time After Time,1984,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind

Suitcase of memories
Time after sometimes you picture me
I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said

Then you say, ""go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me

Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me

Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, ""go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me

Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

The reflex
The reflex
The reflex

You've gone too far this time
But I'm dancing on the Valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line

I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand, oh woah
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand, oh woah

Why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

Oh, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

The reflex is an only child, who's waiting by the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?
And every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark

I'm on a ride and I want to get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold the Renoir and TV set
Don't wanna be around when this gets out

So, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

Why don't you use it?

The reflex is an only child, he's waiting in the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?
And every little thing the reflex does
Leaves an answer with a question mark, play

So, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

The reflex is an only child who's waiting by the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?

24,Rockwell,Somebody's Watching Me,1984,"Who's watching?
Tell me who's watching
Who's watching me?
I'm just an average man, with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone, and
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?
When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid
Well, can the people on TV see me
Or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower
I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes
And find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy
Just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of
""Psycho"" too much
That's why
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
Who's watching me?
I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching?
Well, it's the mailman watching me, and I don't feel safe anymore
Oh, what a mess I wonder who's watching me now
(Who?) the IRS?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me it is just a dream
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me it can't be
I always feel like somebody's watching me"
25,Queen,Radio Ga Ga,1984,"I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry

You made us feel like we could fly

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power

You've yet to have your finest hour

Radio, someone still loves you!

We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend

So stick around cos we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

26,Yes,Owner of a Lonely Heart,1984,"Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself

You are the steps you take
You and you, and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself
Your every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a broken heart

Want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only

You, lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free-will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart

(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

They confused me so
  (Owner of a lonely heart)
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap

And don't you hesitate at all, no no

Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart
  (Owner of a lonely heart)
It will excite, it will delight
It will give a better start
  (Owner of a lonely heart)

Don't deceive your free-will at all
Don't deceive your free-will at all
  (Owner of a lonely heart)
Don't deceive your free-will at all
Just receive it"

38,Alphaville,Forever Young,1984,"Let's dance in style, let's dance for awhile
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the madmen

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young

Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fleeing horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
We let them come true

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?"

To get through this thing called life
Electric word life it means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld, a world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left?
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life things are much harder than in the afterworld
This life you're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you at least you got friends
Come on lady for friendly word
She picked up the phone, dropped it on the floor
Ahh, ahh is all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down, oh, no let's go
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go

All excited but we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause we're all gonna die
And when we do, what's it all for
Better live now before the grim reaper
Come knocking on your door

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down, oh, no let's go
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go

Come on baby let's get nuts
Yeah, crazy

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go, go crazy
I said let's go, go crazy
Let's go, let's go, go, let's go

Hang tough children

46,John Waite,Missing You,1984,"Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

And that's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
That I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you at all
No matter what my heart might say

Well there's a message in the wild
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know, how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world, I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand

And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line
But I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you at all
No matter what heart might say

And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you at all
No matter what my friends might say
I ain't missing you at all

See I can lie to myself these days
I ain't missing you at all
Doing fine baby, every thing's okay
'Cause I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you"

Water in the milk from a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through

Tears from your little sister
Crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go
But you know she'll get by

'Cause she's living in the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can

It's a good thing you don't have a bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket and you'd lose it
In the snow on the ground
You got to walk into town to find a job

Tryin' to keep your hands warm
When the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And chills you to the bone
Now you'd better go home where it's warm

Where you can live in a love of the common people
Smile from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can

Living on a dream ain't easy
But the closer the knit, the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
Keeping 'em in stride for family pride

You know that faith is in your foundation
And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
But don't forget to pray
'Cause making it strong were you belong

And we're living in the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can

Smile's from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can

Living in the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can

Living in the love of the common people
Smile's really hard on a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to

Reading murder books tryin' to stay hip

Say your prayers
Say your prayers

And I wonder why

Now all I can do
Love what was once
So alive and new

As soon as we started to move.

Then love picked us out for romance.
I thought it was clear the plan was we would share,
This feeling just between ourselves.
But when the music changed, the plan was re-arranged
He went to dance with someone else.

We started dancing and love put us into a groove
But now he's with somebody new - what does love want me to do?
Love said:

Let the music play he won't get away,
Just keep the groove and then he'll come back to you again, let it play.
Let the music play he won't get away,
This groove he can't ignore, he won't leave you anymore, no, no, no.

He tried pretending a dance is just a dance, but I see
He's dancing his way back to me.
Guess he's discovered we are truly lovers,
Magic from the very start, 'cause love just kept me groovin',
And he felt me movin' even though we danced apart.
So we started dancing and love put us into the groove
As soon as we started to move, as soon as we started to move.
Love said:

Let the music play he won't get away, ...
He tried pretending a dance is just a dance, but I see
He's dancing his way back to me,

Burning me up from the inside
The sweat is coming through each and every pore

When we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain

And it's times like these
When we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

If someone else is suffering enough
To write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around

Kick inside is in the line
That finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

So turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much

Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say so much

So turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much

When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much
When all the little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

When all the little bit of hope is gone

We were cool on cries

When all you
And everyone we knew
Could believe, do
And share in what was true

I said, ""Dance hall days love""
Dance hall days love
Dance hall days
Dance hall days love

Dance hall days
Dance hall days love
Dance hall days
Dance hall days love"
90,Bonnie Tyler,Holding Out For a Hero,1984,"Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the gods?
Where's the street-wise Hercules
To fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night I toss and turn and dream
of what I need

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
He's gotta be sure
And it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life

Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach
There's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder end rising with the heat
It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
He's gotta be sure
And it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I would swear that there's someone somewhere
Watching me

Through the wind end the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach
Like the fire in my blood"
91,Howard Jones,What is Love?,1984,"I love you whether or not you love me
I love you even if you think that I don't
Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you
But I don't mind
Why should I mind
Why should I mind

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear
Never worry never be sad
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can
This is why I don't mind you doubting

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be
The door always must be left unlocked
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you
And not to spend the time just doubting

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway"
92,Rod Stewart,Infatuation,1984,"Early in the morning I can't sleep
I can't work and I can't eat
I've been drunk all day, can't concentrate
Maybe I'm makin' a big mistake

Caught me down like a killer shark
It's like a railroad running right through my heart
Jekyll and Hyde the way I behave
Feel like I'm running on an empty gauge

Oh no, not again!
It hurts so good
I don't understand

Infatuation

Spirits soar when I'm by her side
She put a little love in this heart of mine
Maybe I'm lucky, maybe I'm freed
Maybe this woman's just all I need

Oh no, not again!

97,Duran Duran,New Moon On Monday,1984,"Shake up the picture, the lizard mixture
With your dance on the eventide
You got me coming up with answers
All of which I deny

I said it again but could I please rephrase it?
Maybe I can catch a ride
I couldn't really put it much plainer
But I wait till you decide

You send me your warning siren
As if I could ever hide
Last time La Luna
I light my torch and wave it for the

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite

Breaking away with the beast of both worlds
A smile that you can't disguise
At every minute I keep finding
Clues that you leave behind

Save me from these reminders
As if I'd forget tonight
This time La Luna
I light my torch and wave it for the

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day
With a lonely satellite
