Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah

I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it; baby, stay with me (I love it)
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
Mum mum mum mah
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
Mum mum mum mah

I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And, baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun (fun)

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

Mum mum mum mah
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
Mum mum mum mah
Mum mum mum mah
(Mum mum mum mah)

I won't tell you that I love you, kiss, or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying, I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunning
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face (she's got me like nobody)

If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out spaced out and losing all control

Fill up my cup, Mazel Tov
Look at her dancing, just take it off
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof, and then we'll do it again

And do it and do it, let's live it up

Maybe I was wrong for trying to pick a fight

14,Owl City,Fireflies,2009,"You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams"

Now can I be her soldier, please?

I'm fightin' for this girl
On the battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby cupid
Sent her arrows from above?
Don't you ever leave the side of me
Indefinitely, not probably
And honestly, I'm down like the economy

Baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry

Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(And the sky is falling down)
Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(Are you down? Are you down?)
Down, down

22,Taylor Swift,Love Story,2009,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes & the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say ""Hello"", little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""
...
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said...

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground & pulled out a ring & said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you & that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""

There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me
Darling it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you all about it

There's a she wolf in your closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
But having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

I wear t-shirt¶
She's cheer captain¶

That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me?

Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""

And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in awhile
Since she brought you down.

You say you're fine—I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers

In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry

And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

In this corner, weighing 175 pounds, with a record of 17 rapes
400 assaults, and 4 murders, the undisputed, most diabolical
Villain in the world, Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ok, let's go
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I'm laying the cut
Missed the cut, the lady give a eighty some paper cut

Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio is back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

They see that low rider go by they're like ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again

I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maico beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
Its what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marajauan do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat ass burgundy bags, classy shit
Jimmy Cho shoes I say move a bitch move

Keep rockin' and keep knockin'
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebok'n
You see the hate that they servin' on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race but I've already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinkin' 'bout our life, a house and kids, yeah
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down
Knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

I never thought I'd hear myself say
Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today
I used to be commander in chief of my pimp ship flyin' high
'Til I met this pretty little missile, shot me out the sky

Hate to know I'm crashin', don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby, if could

Miss independent to the fullest
The load never too much, she helpin' me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight, girl

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
And seemed to only take the head of football teams

And I was the class clown that always kept you laughin'
We were never meant to be baby, we just happened
So please don't mess up the trick
Hey young world I'm the new Slick Rick

They say I move to quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hour glass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes

How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice
OMG you listen to that bitch? Whoa it's me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it we was magic, I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask 'em

Say you gotta take the good, the bad, happy and the sad
But when you bring a better future than I had in the past
'Cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again

I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
And if it hits better make it worth the first when it comes around

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
See when love comes it knocks you down
Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
See when love comes it knocks you down, yeah"
55,Lily Allen,The Fear,2009,"I wanna be rich and I want lots of money
I don't care about clever, I don't care about funny
I want loads of clothes and fuck loads of diamonds
I heard people die while they're trying to find them

And I'll take my clothes off, and it will be shameless
'Cause everyone knows that's how you get famous
I'll look at The Sun, and I'll look in The Mirror
I'm on the right track, yeah I'm onto a winner
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore

And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?

'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear

Life's about film stars and less about mothers
It's all about fast cars and cussing each other
But it doesn't matter 'cause I'm packing plastic
And that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic
And I am a weapon of massive consumption
And it's not my fault, it's how I'm programmed to function
I'll look at The Sun, and I'll look in The Mirror
I'm on the right track, yeah we're onto a winner
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear
Forget about guns and forget ammunition
'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission
Now I'm not a saint, but I'm not a sinner
And everything's cool as long as I'm getting thinner
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear"

Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play the key
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, I'm moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart, beating
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer, to yourself
He says, close your eyes sometimes it helps
And then I get, a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart, beating
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I, ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart, beating
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!
I know that I must pass this test
And you can see my heart, beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest

Is all I will know

Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer
In the middle of winter
Like a hard candy
With a surprise center
How do I get better
Once I've had the best
You said there's
Tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

I taste your mouth

And take me away
Oh no more mistakes

59,Green Day,21 Guns,2009,"Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?

Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul

Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

72,Nickelback,If Today Was Your Last Day,2009,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had, if today was your last day?
What if, what if, if today was your last day?

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you're never living twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?

And would you call those friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are

So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?

And would you call those friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreaming of

84,Empire of the Sun,We Are The People,2009,"We can remember swimming in December
Heading for the city lights in 1975
We share in each other
Nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

We lived an adventure
Love in the Summer
Followed the sun till night
Reminiscing other times of life
For each every other
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, got lost in your eyes

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

Can you remember and humanise?
It was still where we'd energised
Lie in the sand and visualise
Like it's '75 again

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

Or girl, without a broom I might just sweep you off your feet
And make you wanna tell somebody, body how I do

You close your eyes as I improv between your legs
We work our way from kitchen stoves and tables
Girl you know I'm only able to please, yeah
Say you wanted flowers on the bed
But you got me and now it's on again

Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children and your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your loving behind you
Can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you except everything you had
And what was left after that too
Happiness, it hurt like a bullet in the mind
Stuck them up drainpipes by someone who should know better than that

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers

God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise

(And I hope...)
If I could see the future and how this plays out
I bet it's better than where we are now
But after going through this
It's easier to see the reason why

It's no surprise, I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today

Her diamonds falling down, way down

She sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And I know I could break her concentration
But it don't feel right

By the light of the moon, she rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her

And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
But don't let her see

And she says ooh, I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now

She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

She shuts out the night
Tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Then she'll be alright, she'll be alright
Just not tonight

And she says ooh, I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now

She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling

Ooh, I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
But her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now

She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor
No more, no more, no more
Diamonds falling down

I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor
No more, no more, no more
Diamonds falling down

I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor
  (No more, no more)
Her diamonds falling, all her diamonds
Diamonds falling down

I can't take these diamonds falling down"

I'm Such a big ego uh uh uh
I got a big ha ha ha ego
She love my big ha ha ha ego
So stroke my big ha ha ha ego
I like to joke around a little bit but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold plated EARL
Everything I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl she said know what grow up, ya nasty
I don’t understand why they tripping if you ask me
Flow just the nicest
I emit the propane
I just spit prolly just raise the gas prices
Everybody in the club tryn'a get as fresh as me
What you on dog?
Tryn'a stay recession free
and spit refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You prolly get sweaty, you should get a extra tee
Now I'm standing next to Jay who standing next to B
Could’ve been anywhere in the world but you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego, ha ha, me and my ego
And he go everywhere we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league,
One day I’d play Kobe or walk up to Puff
And he would really know me.
Couldn’t let the dream killers kill my self-esteem.
Or use the arrogance as the steam that power my dreams and my ego

[Beyoncé:]
It’s on,
Baby lets get lost
You don’t need
To call into work,
Cuz you’re the boss
For real want you
To show me how you feel
I consider myself
Lucky that’s a big deal

Why, well,
You got the key to my heart
But you ain’t gonna need it
I’d rather you open up my body
And show me secrets
You didn’t know was inside,
No need for me to lie

It’s too big

It’s too strong
It wont fit
It’s too much

Cuz he can back it up

Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It’s too much
He walks like this
Cuz he can back it up

Usually I’m humble
Right now I don’t choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confidant
You decide when you find
On what I’m working with

Damn I know,
I’m killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it’s my smile
Or maybe my eyes
Boy you a site to see
Kind of something like me

It’s too big
It’s too wide
It’s too strong
It wont fit

Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I’m that b****
Ego so strong, if you ain’t know
I don’t need no beat, I can sing it with piano"
99,Leona Lewis,Happy,2009,"Someone once told me
That you have to choose
What you win or lose
You can't have everything

Don't you take chances
You might feel the pain
Don't you love in vain
'Cause love won't set you free

I could stand by the side
And watch this life pass me by
So unhappy
But safe as could be

So what if it hurts me?
So what it I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I'm just trying to be happy
I just wanna be happy, yeah

Holding on tightly
Just can't let it go
Just trying to play my role
Slowly disappear

But all these days
They feel like they're the same
Just different faces
Different names
Get me out of here

I can't stand by the side
Ooh, no
And watch this life pass me by
Pass me by

So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge?
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I'm just trying to be happy

Oh, happy
Oh

So many turns that I can't see
Like I'm a stranger on this road
But don't say victim
Don't say anything

So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge?
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I just wanna be happy
Happy
I just wanna be
Oh
I just wanna be
Happy
