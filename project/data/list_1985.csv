We Are The World
Written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie

There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life,
The greatest gift of all

We can go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth you know love is all wee need

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me


Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

When you're down and out
There seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Let us realize that a change can only come
When we stand together as one

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Take On Me
Take On Me
Aha
(Hunting High And Low)

We're talking away
I don't know what
I'm to say I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But that's me stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK.
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh the things that you say
Is it life or
Just a play my worries away
You're all the things I've got to 
remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Agent Provocateur
I Want To Know What Love Is
I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
I through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain

Show me love is real, yeah

4,Lionel Richie,"Say You, Say Me",1985,"Say you, say me, say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me, say it together
Naturally

I had a dream I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt
A voice was crying out

Say you, say me, say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me, say it together
Naturally

As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
A helping hand, some one who understands
And when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say, ""I'll show you""

Say you, say me, say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me, say it together
Naturally

So you think you know the answers, oh no
Well the whole world has got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing, oh yes
Believing who you are, you are a shining star

Say you, say me, say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me, say it together
Naturally
Say it together
Naturally"

Shout

Come on

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white

6,Tears For Fears,Everybody Wants to Rule the World,1985,"Welcome to your life, there's no turning back
Even while we sleep we will find you

Acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design, it's my own remorse
Help me to decide, help me make the most

Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you

So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world

Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it
One headline, why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world"
7,Dire Straits,Money For Nothing,1985,"Now look at them yo-yo's that's the way you do it

That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators

Custom kitchens deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators

Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera
Man we could have some fun
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
Bangin' on the bongoes like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin' get your chicks for free

8,Madonna,Crazy For You,1985,"Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one
I see you through the smoky air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss

Because, I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you
Crazy for you, crazy for you

It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you

Crazy for you, baby"
9,Elton John,Nikita,1985,"Hey Nikita is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the world
And never find a warmer soul to know

Oh I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow

Oh Nikita you will never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know

Do you ever dream of me?
Do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night?

And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Oh Nikita you will never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know

Oh Nikita you will never know, never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know

10,Murray Head,One Night in Bangkok,1985,"One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the Devil walking next to me

Bangkok, Oriental setting
And the city don't know what the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner

Time flies, doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean Spa had the chess boys in it
All change, don't you know that when you
Play at this level, there's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland or the Philippines
Or Hastings or, or this place

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a God in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the God's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, Brother

It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city

Whaddya mean?
Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town

Tea girls, warm and sweet, warm, sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham Suite

""Get Thai'd"", you're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the Devil walking next to me

Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would
A muddy old river or Reclining Buddha

But thank God, I'm only watching the game, controlling it

I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you

So you better go back to your bars, your temples
Your massage parlors

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a God in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel slidin' up to me

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the Devil walking next to me"
11,Huey Lewis & The News,The Power of Love,1985,"The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling, that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love will keep you home at night

You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love, that's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But do be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go 'round

And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden, it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmmm

It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel nothin' till you feel

You feel the power, just feel the power of love
That's the power, that's the power of love
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Feel the power of love"
12,Paul Hardcastle,19,1985,"In 1965 Vietnam seemed like just another foreign war but it wasn't
It was different in many ways, as so were tose that did the fighting
In World War II the average age of the combat soldier was 26
In Vietnam he was 19
In-in-in Vietnam he was 19

The shooting and fighting of the past two weeks continued today
25 miles west of Saigon
I really wasn't sure what was going on

Ni-ni-ni 19, 19, ni-19 19

In Vietnam the combat soldier typically served
A twelve month tour of duty
But was exposed to hostile fire almost everyday
Ni-ni-ni 19, Ni-ni-ni 19

Hundreds of thousands of men who saw heavy combat
In Vietnam were arrested since discharge
Their arrest rate is almost twice that of non-veterans of the same age
There are no accurate figures of how many of these men
Have been incarcerated

But a Veterans Administration study
Concludes that the greater of vets
Exposure to combat could more likely affect his chances
Of being arrested or convicted

This is one legacy of the Vietnam War

All those who remember the war
They won't forget what they've seen
Destruction of men in their prime
Whose average was 19

De-de-destruction
De-de-destruction
War, war

De-de-destruction, wa, wa, war, wa, war, war
De-de-destruction
War, war

After World War II the men came home together on troop ships
But the Vietnam vet often arrived home within 48 hours of jungle combat
Perhaps the most dramatic difference between
World War II and Vietnam was coming home
None of them received a hero's welcome

None of them received a heroes welcome, none of them, none of them
Ne-ne-ne, ne-ne-ne, none of them, none of them, none of them
None of them received a hero's welcome
None of them received a hero's welcome

According to a Veteran's Administration study
Half of the Vietnam combat veterans suffered from what
Psychiatrists call
Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder

Many vets complain of alienation, rage or guilt
Some succumb to suicidal thoughts
Eight to ten years after coming home
Almost eight hundred thousand men are still fighting the Vietnam War

De-de-destruction
Ni-ni-ni 19, 19, ni19 19
Ni-ni-ni 19, 19, ni-19 19

When we came back it was different, everybody wants to know
""How'd it happened to those guys over there?
There's gotta be something wrong somewhere
We did what we had to do

There's gotta be something wrong somewhere
People wanted us to be ashamed of what it made us
Dad had no idea what he went to fight and he is now
All we want to do is come home

All we want to do is come home
What did we do it for?
All we want to do is come home
Was it worth it"
13,Duran Duran,A View to a Kill,1985,"Meeting you, with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places, feel the chill
Night fall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still oversea, could it be the whole world opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
The weekend's why

Until we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

Choice for you, is the view to a kill
Between the shades, assassination's standing still
The first crystal tears, fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years, to drench you skin with lovers rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die

But can we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, when all we see is the view to a kill"
14,Tina Turner,We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome),1985,"Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time

We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind

And I wonder when
We are ever gonna change, change
Living under the fear
'Til nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome

Looking for something we can rely on
There's gotta be something better out there
Love and compassion, their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air

And I wonder when
We are ever gonna change, change
Living under the fear
'Til nothing else remains

All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome

So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Is it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond Thunderdome

All the children say
(We don't need another hero)
We don't need another hero

Going to take you apart

17,Don Henley,The Boys of Summer,1985,"Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach

Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer, have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand
What happened to our love
But babe I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer, have gone

Out on the road today
I saw a deadhead sticker on a cadillac
A little voice inside my head said:
""Don't look back, you can never look back""
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but,

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down
Radio on baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer, have gone"

Made it clear suddenly

But they can't see the light
(That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest
Then I have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie
But I don't let them play
(No way)
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

'Cause they are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
(Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world
(Material)
Living in a material world

Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

A material, a material

34,Bryan Adams,Heaven,1985,"Oh thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free

Bring you up when you're feelin' down

Oh there's lots that I could say

Through the good times and the bad
I'll be standin' there by you, oh!

Work

Somebody told me
""Boy, everything she wants is everything she sees""
I guess I must have loved you
'Cause I said you were the perfect girl for me, baby

But now we're six months older
And everything you want and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me but boy

Somebody tell me, won't you tell me
Why I work so hard for you?
Give you money
All to give you money

Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun, girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give and take
Well, show me you can take you've got some giving to do

And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Than how can it be good enough for two?
I can't work any harder than I do

Somebody tell me, won't you tell me?
Why I work so hard for you?
Give you money
All to give you money

Why do I do the things I do? I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you

Won't you tell me?
Give you money
All to give you money

Somebody tell me, won't you tell me?
Why I work so hard for you?

Passin' by, movin' straight ahead, you knew it all
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone, everything has changed

Play the game, you know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on, only you can do what must be done
You know in some way you're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner and you're tryin' to break free

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher
Gonna be your man in motion, all I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's fire

Burning up, don't know just how far that I can go
(Just how far I go)
Soon be home, only just a few miles down the road
I can make it, I know, I can
You broke the boy in me but you won't break the man

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher
Gonna be your man in motion, all I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's fire

I can climb the highest mountain, cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burnin' in me, burnin' in me

Just once in his life a man has his time
And my time is now, I'm coming alive

I can hear the music playin', I can see the banners fly
Feel like you're back again, and hope ridin' high
Gonna be your man in motion, all I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's fire

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher

45,REO Speedwagon,Can't Fight This Feeling,1985,"I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship
Has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places
That alone I'd never find

And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever

Jimmy quit, Jody got married

Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standing on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Back in the summer of '69, oh

We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no

52,The Commodores,Nightshift,1985,"Marvin, he was a friend of mine
And he could sing his song
His heart in every line
Marvin, sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds
And I still can hear him say
Oh talk to me, so you can see, what's goin' on
Say you will, sing your songs, for evermore, evermore

Gonna be some sweet sounds
Comin' down, on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
Oh, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night,
It's gonna be all right, on the nightshift

54,Jim Diamond,I Should Have Known Better,1985,"And I should have known better
to lie to one as beautiful as you.
Yeah, I should have known better
to take a chance on ever losing you.
But I thought you'd understand
can you forgive me?

I saw you walking by the other day.
I know that you saw me, you turned away and I was lost.
You see: I've never loved no one as much as you.
I've fooled around but tell me now just who is hurting who?
And I should have known better
to lie to one as beautiful as you
I should have known better
to take a chance on ever losing you
but I thought you'd understand
can you forgive me

I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
should have known better
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
should have known better.

It's true
I took our love for granted all along.
And trying to explain where I went wrong
I just don't know.
I cry but tears don't seem to help me carry on.
Now there is no chance you'll come back home
got too much pride.
And I should have known better
to lie to one as beautiful as you
I should have known better
to take a chance on ever losing you
but I thought you'd understand
can you forgive me

I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I love you
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I love you.

He could throw that speedball by ya, make you look like a fool
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar i was walking in he was walking out
We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks, but all we kept talking about

Glory days, yeah they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

There's this girl that lives up the block, back in school she could turn all the boys heads
Sometimes on friday i'll stop by and have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband bobby, well they split up, i guess it's two years gone by
We just sit around talking about the old times, she says when she feels like crying she starts laughing thinking about

Glory days...

Think i'm going down to the well tonight and i'm gonna drink till i get my fill
I hope when i get older i don't sit around thinking about it, but i probably will
Yeah just sitting back trying to recapture a little of the glory of

64,Prince,Raspberry Beret,1985,"One, two, one, two, three

I was working part time in a five and dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close too nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't to bright, but I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
If it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I, think I, I think I love her

The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
If it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

I think I love"

Security throw through the wall
Future dreams we have to realize
A thousand skeptic hands
Won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize

And do you feel scared - I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
Woh woh woh oh oh oh oh, woh woh woh oh oh oh oh

Treating today as though it was
The last, the final show
Get to sixty and feel no regret
It may take a little time
A lonely path, an uphill climb
Success or failure will not alter it

And do you feel scared - I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
Woh woh woh oh oh oh oh, woh woh woh oh oh oh oh

For this is not a miracle

A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

For this is not America
This is not America
This is not


Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals
To the ground
So bloody red tomorrows clouds

The little piece in me
Will die

There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky

You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowds through the midnight heat
The traffic roars
And the sirens scream
You look at the faces, its just like a dream

Nobody know where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
living in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your blood, its in your moves
You're a man of the street

When you said goodbye
You were on the run
Tryin' to get away from the things you'd done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened, but nothing has changed

You still don't know where you're going
Your still just a face in the crowd

'Cause you belong to the city

You can feel it

88,Corey Hart,Never Surrender,1985,"Just a little more time
Is all we're asking for
'Cause just a little more time
Could open closing doors
Just a little uncertainty
Can bring you down

And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how

So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender

And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender

With a little perseverance
You can get things done
Without the blind adherence

That has conquered some
And nobody wants to know you now

And nobody wants to show you how
So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home

You can never surrender
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender

To never surrender
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
No one can take away your right

To fight and to never surrender
To never surrender
Oh, time is all we're asking for
To never surrender
Oh, oh, you can never surrender
Time is all you're asking for
Stand your ground, never surrender
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I said
You never surrender, oh"

Way back then we were friends going together

92,Jermaine Jackson,Do What You Do,1985,"I don't mind-
Why don't you do what you do when you did what you did to me?
Love was so good that it filled up all my needs.

I was crazy for you
you were crazy for me

How could something so right go so wrong

my love
sweet love?

Why don't you say what you say
when you say what you said anymore?
Your eyes couldn't lie
so long goodbye
close the door.
I was crazy for you
you were crazy for me
how could something so right go so wrong
my love, sweet love

Tell me something I didn't do

Why did someone else have to pull you through?
Did they steal you away like a thief in the night?
Love like this must take flight.

Why don't they play what they played
on the nights you danced with me?
Remember the one we made love to endlessly.
I was crazy for you
you were crazy for me

Why don't you do what you do when you did what you did to
me?
Do what you do when you did what you did to me.
Do what you do when you did what you did to me.
Do what you do when you did what you did to me."
93,U2,The Unforgettable Fire,1985,"Ice
Your only rivers run cold
These city lights
They shine as silver and gold
Dug from the night
Your eyes as black as coal

Walk on by
Walk on through
Walk 'til you run
And don't look back
For here I am

Carnival
The wheels fly and the colors spin
Through alcohol
Red wine that punctures the skin
Face to face
In a dry and waterless place

Walk on by
Walk on through
So sad to besiege your love
So head on

Stay in this time
Stay tonight in a lie
I'm only asking but I
I think you know

Come on take me away
Come on take me away
Come on take me home
Home again

And if the mountain should crumble
Or I disappear into the sea
Not a tear, no not I

Stay in this time
Stay tonight in a lie
Ever after, this love in time
And if you will save your love, save it all
Save it all

Don't push me too far
Don't push me too far
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight"
