1,Berlin,Take My Breath Away,1986,"Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching i keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say

Take my breath away
Through the hourglass i saw you

in time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed i called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am afraid
Take my breath away

Take my breath away
Watching every motion

In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away"
2,Dionne Warwick,That's What Friends Are For,1986,"And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe, I love you

And if I should ever go away
Well, then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for

(Stevie Wonder)
Well, you came in loving me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way
I thank you

Oh and then for the times when we're apart
Well, then close your eyes and know
The words are coming from my heart
And then if you can remember

(Stevie Wonder)

'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby

You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, Daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess and I don't mean maybe

He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe, we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice
Please

Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep

5,The Pet Shop Boys,West End Girls,1986,"Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables

In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground
To a dive bar in a West End town

In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls

Faces on posters, too many choices

Have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often?
And which do you choose, a hard or soft option?

In every city, in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station

6,The Bangles,Walk Like an Egyptian,1986,"All the old paintings on the tomb
They do the sand dance, don't you know
If they move too quick (oh way oh)
They're falling down like a domino

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh way oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
Way oh way oh, way oh way oh
Walk like an Egyptian

The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh way oh)

You drop your drink
Then they bring you more
All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band

When the buzzer rings (oh way oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian
All the kids in the marketplace say
Way oh way oh, way oh way oh
Walk like an Egyptian
Slide your feet up the street
Bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back

Life is hard you know (oh way oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac
If you want to find all the cops

They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh way oh)
They spin the clubs cruise down the block

All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh way oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian
All the cops in the donut shop say
Way oh way oh, way oh way oh
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian"

8,Chris de Burgh,The Lady in Red,1986,"I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance,
given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes

I have been blind

The Lady In Red
is dancing with me
(Cheek to cheek)

There's no body here,
it's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know
this beauty by my side
I'll never forget

the way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright,
you were amazing

I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled,
it took my breath away
I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

The Lady In Red
is dancing with me
(Cheek to cheek)
There's no body here,
it's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know
this beauty by my side
I'll never forget
the way you look tonight
I never will forget
the way you look tonight...

Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown
The final countdown

Ohh
We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall

With so many light years to go and things to be found

12,Madonna,Live to Tell,1986,"I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then
It will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then
It will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear, when will they learn, how will they know?

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then
It will burn inside of me

Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name

She's got it 
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire

14,Whitney Houston,Greatest Love of All,1986,"I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be and so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed at least I live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself it is the greatest love of all

I believe that children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed at least I live as I believe
No matter what they take from me

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself it is the greatest love of all

And if by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love"
15,Steve Winwood,Higher Love,1986,"Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love, I keep thinking of?

Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning, and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love, I keep thinking of?

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above on a higher love

I will wait for it, I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love, I keep thinking of?

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love"

Your heart beats in double time

Oblivion is all you crave

It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an airoplane
I still couldn't make it on time

'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my funday
My I don't have to runday
It's just another manic Monday

All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick
Last night to get down?
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down

He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my funday
My I don't have to runday
It's just another manic Monday

I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my funday
It's just another manic Monday"
18,Patti LaBelle,On My Own,1986,"So many times said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you

On my own
On my own
On my own

So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married

On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself

No one said it was easy, no one
But it once was so easy
Well I believed in love
Now here I stand, I wonder why

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way?
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

So many times, I know I should have told you
Losing you it cut like a knife, hey
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you

On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to end
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again
On my own
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone

On my own
I've got to find out where I belong again
On my own
I've got to learn how to be strong again
On my own
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone

By myself by myself
By myself by myself
On my own
I've got to find out what was mine again
On my own
My heart is saying that it's my time again

On my own
And I have faith that I will shine again
I have faith give me love
On my own
On my own
On my own
Burn my soul
Burn my soul"
19,Madonna,True Blue,1986,"Hey
What?
Listen

I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'Til you walked through my door

I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me, baby, this I know

'Cause it's true love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried, oh so many times
Those tear drops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend

So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

'Cause it's true love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love
It's true love, oh baby, true love, oh baby

20,Peter Cetera,Glory of Love,1986,"Tonight it's very clear, as we're both lying here
There's so many things, I want to say
I will always love you, I would never leave you alone

Sometimes I just forget, say things I might regret
It breaks my heart to see you crying
I don't wanna lose you, I could never make it alone

I am a man, who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We'll live forever, knowing together that we
Did it all for the glory of love

You keep me standing tall, you help me through it all
I'm always strong when you're beside me
I have always needed you, I could never make it alone

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of
We'll live forever, knowing together that we
Did it all for the glory of love

Just like a knight in shining armor, from a long time ago
Just in time I will save the day, take you to my castle far away

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that you're dreaming of
We're gonna live forever, knowing together that we
Did it all for the glory of love

We'll live forever, knowing together that we
Did it all for the glory of love

We did it all for love, we did it all for love"
21,Cutting Crew,(I Just) Died in Your Arms Tonight,1986,"Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this

Her diary, it sits on the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cat's in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again

I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away

It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over, the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away"
22,George Michael,A Different Corner,1986,"I'd say love was a magical thing
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there, had I been there

I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So I don't dare, no I don't dare

'Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared

Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care?

I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little, you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care?

No, I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love

And if all that there is, is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear"

Rival nations
It's a primitive clash
Venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope
Against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up
Against the ropes
Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West?
Or Man against Man?

Can any nation stand alone?
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart

The unmistakable fire

In the burning heart
In the warrious code
There's no surrender
Though his body says stop
His spirit cries - never!
Deep in our soul
A quiet ember
Know it's you against you
It's the paradox
That drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack
It's the passion that kills

The victory is yours alone
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart

The unmistakable fire
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst

And found nothing there
To ease the pressure of
My ever worrying mind
All my powers waste away
I fear the crazed and lonely looks
The mirror's sending me
These Days

Gloomily through time

Thinking there's got to be some way
To keep my troubles distant

It was a time to relax and let your worries behind

Exactly seven weeks or something crossed my mind.
It was the shine of the time we never forget

One morning our parents kicked us out of our beds.
We told them it was stupid

I told him it's my life and I know what T'm doin'.
I saw the school Ithought I'll never stay

I need my holiday!

Well

There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
When I'm absolutely sane

As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners

With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same

If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films

There's no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true

Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Oh, we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake

As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners

But if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed

If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could sail over heartaches

57,Diana Ross,Chain Reaction,1986,"You took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do, oh

And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You took a little, then you took me over
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying, trying, anything for you

I'm in the middle of a chain reaction
You give me all the after midnight action
I wanna get you where
I can let you make all that love to me

To anywhere and there ain't no salvation
I need you to get me nearer to you

Pleasure made for you, oh

You gotta plan, your future is on the run
Shine a light for the whole world over
You never find your love if you hide away
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is

Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
I wanna get your love all ready
For the sweet sensation, instant radiation

You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you

58,Heart,These Dreams,1986,"Spare a little candle, save some light for me
Figures up ahead moving in the trees
White skin in linen, perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over these dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge, shadows where I stand
I search for the time on a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly, come closer than this
But all I remember are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Is it cloak 'n' dagger? Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight, the candle in my grip
And words that have no form are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

There's something out there I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence that I've ever heard
Funny how your feet in dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face from dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life

How
How can it be?
That a love
Carved out of caring
Fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games
Played once too often
But making mistakes
Is a part
Of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong
To be human after all?

Ohhh, drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

That there is somethin' about you
Baby, so right
I wouldn't be without you
Baby, tonight

If ever our love
Was concealed
No one can say that
We didn't feel
Million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone
Fragile but free
We remain
Tender together
Not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear
The time that told the truth

Because there's somethin' about you
The way you are so right
  (Baby)
I couldn't live without you

Spinning in infinity he says Amen! and Hallelujah!
