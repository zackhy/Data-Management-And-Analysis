1,Frank Sinatra,Strangers in the Night,1966,"Strangers in the night exchanging glances

Wondering in the night
What were the chances we'd be sharing love
Before the night was through.
Something in your eyes was so inviting

Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you.
Strangers in the night

Two lonely people we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello.
Little bit we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away, and
Ever since that night we've been together.

Lovers at first sight, in love forever.
It turned out so right
For strangers in the night.
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away.
Ever since that night we've been together.
Lovers at first sight, in love forever.
It turned out so right
For strangers in the night."
2,Nancy Sinatra,These Boots Are Made For Walking,1966,"You keep saying, you got something for me
Something you call love but confess
You've been messin' where you shouldn't have been messin'
And now someone else is getting all your best

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

Yeah, you keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'
And you keep losing when you oughta not bet
You keep samin' when you oughta be changin'
Now, what's right is right but you ain't been right yet

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burnt
Ah, I've just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah
And what he knows you ain't had time to learn

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

Are you ready, boots?
Start walking"

6,Simon & Garfunkel,The Sounds of Silence,1966,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words, that I might teach you
Take my arms, that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the Prophets
Are written on the subway walls and tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence"
7,The Rolling Stones,Paint it Black,1966,"I see a red door and I want it painted black.
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black.
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back.
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away.
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day.

I look inside myself and see my heart is black.
I see my red door and must have it painted black.
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black.

No more will my green segel turn a deeper blue.
I could not foresee this thing happening to you.
If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes.

I see a red door and I want it painted black.
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black.
I see the girls go by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.

Hmm...
I wanna see your face painted black.
Black as night, black as coal.
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky.
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black, yeah!

Shimmering around the floor

Bells on feet go, ting a ling a linging
Going through my head
Sweat is falling just-a-like-a tear drops
Running from her head

Now she dancing, going through the movements
Swaying to and fro
Body moving, bringing back a memory
Thoughts of long ago

Blood is rushing, temperature is rising
Sweating from my brow
Like a snake, her body fascinates me
I can’t look away now

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Or I’ll have to leave

Now, she’s moving all around the tables
Luring all in sight
But I know that she cannot see me
Hidden by the light

Closer, closer, she is getting nearer
Soon she’ll be in reach
As I enter into a spotlight
She stands lost for speech

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Or I’ll have to leave

Give me time to breathe

Don’t know what to think
And we struggle knocking over tables
Spilling all the drinks

Can’t they understand that I want her?
Happens every week
Heavy hand upon my collar
Throws me in the street

Give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Or I’ll have to leave, leave"

I walked on over and asked her to dance
Thinkin' maybe later of makin' romance
But every guy there was thinkin' like me
I had to stand in line to get a dance with Sweet Pea

Oh Sweet Pea, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on, come on and dance with me
Oh Sweet Pea, won't you be my girl?
Won't you? Won't you? Won't you be my girl?

I finally got to whisper sweet words in her ear
Convinced her that we oughta get away from there
We took a little walk I held her close to me
And underneath the stars I said to Sweet Pea

Oh Sweet Pea I love you can't you see
Love you, love you, love you can't you see
Oh Sweet Pea, won't you be my girl?
Won't you? Won't you? Won't you be my girl?"

46,Simon & Garfunkel,I am a Rock,1966,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow

I am a rock
I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain

I am a rock
I am an island

Don't talk of love
Well I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I never loved, I never would have cried

I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no one, and no one touches me

I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries"

She's out of reach and out of sight
When she walks by she brightens up the neighborhood
Oh every guy would make her his if he just could
If she just would
Some sweet day I'll make her mine pretty flamingo
Then every guy will envy me
Cause paradise is where I'll be

To take us over the road
Man made the train

Man made the electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark
This is a man's, man's, man's world

Nothing

Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone who cares
Always moving and goin' nowhere

All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere

Did you ever have to finally decide?

With hair down to here and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl

And then you know you better make up your mind
And pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you in line
And says, ""Better go home, son, and make up your mind""

Then you bet you'd better finally decide
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?"

I can't get your love, I can't get a fraction
Uh-oh, little girl, psychotic reaction
(Shouted) And it feels like this!

I feel so lonely night and day
I can't get your love, I must stay away
I need you girl, by my side
Uh-oh, little girl, would you like to take a ride, now
I can't get your love, I can't get satisfaction
Uh-oh, little girl, psychotic reaction"

I keep hearin' you're concerned about my happiness
But all that thought you're givin' me is conscience I guess
If I was walkin' in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
While you 'n' your friends are worried about me I'm havin' lots of fun

CHORUS
Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothin' to do

Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine
You can always find me here, I'm havin' quite a time

CHORUS

It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

CHORUS

Don't tell me I've nothin' to do

Let's share all the time we can before it's too late
Love me now for now is all the time there may be
If you love me Mary, Mary marry me

I hear the sound of bugles blow
Far away, far away
And if they call, then I must go
Across the sea, so wild and gray

So Mary marry me, let's not wait
For the distant drums might change our wedding date
And love me now, for now is all the time there may be

94,Otis Redding,Try a Little Tenderness,1966,"Oh, she may be weary
And young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old shaggy dress, yeah yeah
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness, yeah yeah

Just anticipating for things that she'll
Never never never never possess, yeah yeah

Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Get to her drop drop
Just try a little tenderness, oh yeah yeah yeah
You've got to know how to love her, man
You'll be surprised, man

You've got to squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave
You've got to hold her and rub her softly

Followin' behind me?

No money coming in
The rent collector's knocking, trying to get in

Boil the tea and put some toast on

I'm deep in debt and now it's much too late

They might as well be dead

And sip their lemonade

When the sun shines, when the sun shines

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

I can show you that when it starts to rain

Everything's the same

I can show you, I can show you

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine
