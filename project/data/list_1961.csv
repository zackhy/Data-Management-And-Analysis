2,Ben E King,Stand By Me,1961,"When the night has come
and the land is dark
and the moon is the only
light we'll see.
No I won't be afraid
no I won't be afraid
just as long as you stand
stand by me.
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
oh stand, stand by me
stand by me.
If the sky that we look upon
should tumble and fall
and the mountains should crumble to the sea.
I won't cry, I won't cry
no I won't shed a tear
just as long as you stand
stand by me.
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me

oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me.
Darlin', darlin', stand by me
oh stand by me
oh stand now, stand by me
stand by me.
Whenever you're in trouble
won't you stand by me
oh stand by me
oh..."
3,Elvis Presley,Surrender,1961,"When we kiss my heart's on fire
Burning with a strange desire
And I know, each time I kiss you
That your heart's on fire too

So, my darling, please surrender
All your love so warm and tender
Let me hold you in my arms, dear
While the moon shines bright above

All the stars will tell the story
Of our love and all it's glory
Let us take this night of magic
And make it a night of love

Won't you please surrender to me?
Your lips, your arms, your heart, dear
Be mine forever, be mine tonight"
4,Del Shannon,Runaway,1961,"As I walk along, I wonder
A-what went wrong with our love
A love that was so strong

And as I still walk on, I think of
The things we've done together
While our hearts were young

I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin', and I feel the pain
A-wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery

And I wonder
I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder
Why
Why, why, why, why, why
She ran away
And I wonder
Where she will stay-ay
My little runaway
A-run, run, run, run, runaway

I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin', and I feel the pain
A-wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder
I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder
Why
Why, why, why, why, why
She ran away

5,The Marcels,Blue Moon,1961,"Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own"
6,Ricky Nelson,Hello Mary Lou,1961,"Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
And oo I wanted you forever more
Now I'm not one that gets around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before

I said, hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

I saw your lips I heard your voice
Believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
I thought about a moonlit night
My arms about good an' tight
That's all I had to see for me to say

Hey, hey, hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Yes hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart"
7,Elvis Presley,Wooden Heart,1961,"Can't you see, I love you
Please don't break my heart in two
That's not hard to do
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart

And if you say goodbye
Then I know that I would cry
Maybe I would die
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart

There's no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start

Treat me nice, treat me good
Treat me like you really should
'Cause I'm not made of wood
And I don't have a wooden heart

Muss I denn, muss I denn
Zum stadtele hinaus
Stadtele hinaus
Und du, mein schat, bleibst hier?

Muss I denn, muss I denn
Zum stadtele hinaus

9,Roy Orbison,Crying,1961,"I was alright, for a while
I could smile for a while
but when I saw you last night
you held my hand so tight
as you stopped to say hello
oh, you wished me well
and you couldn't tell
that i'd been
crying over you
crying over you
when you said so long
you left me standing all alone
alone and crying
crying
crying
I'm crying
it's hard to understand
that the touch of your hand
could start me crying
...
I thought that I was over you
but it's true, oh so true
I love you even more
than I did before
but darling, what can I do
'cause you don't love me
and I'll always be
crying over you
crying over you
and now that you're gone
and from this moment on
I'll be crying
crying
crying
crying
I'm crying
I'm crying
over you"

11,Dion,Runaround Sue,1961,"Here's my story, it's sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town

Ah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl will leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue
I miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hair and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

She'll love you but she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise

I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll say
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue

12,Henry Mancini,Moon River,1961,"Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me"

14,Jimmy Dean,Big Bad John,1961,"Big John
Big John

Ev'ry mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six foot six and weighed two forty five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, he just said, ""Hi"" to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, ""There's a light up above""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John

Big Bad John

'cause he was telling everyone in town
About the love that he just found
And marie's the name of his latest flame

He talked and talked and I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
The prettiest green eyes anywhere
And marie's the name of his latest flame

Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burning
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returning
What else was there for me to do but cry

Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
She'd be mine eternally

Makes my heart start to yearn

Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play

Still, I know our eyes often meet
I feel tingles down to my feet
When you smile, that's much too discreet
Sends me on my way

Not to be so polite
You could offer a light
Start a little conversation now
It's alright, just take five

He said ""Hey, I'd like to make a trade with you
'Cos, you see if I was a lightning bug
I'd search the whole night through
Searching for home, I'd have me plenty of homes""

And the boll weevil called the farmer, and he said
""You better sell your old machines
'Cause when I'm through with your cotton
You can't even buy gasoline
I gonna stake me a home, gotta have a home""

And the boll weevil said to the farmer, said

On a weekend pass I wouldn’t have had time
To get home and marry, that baby of mine
So I went to the Chaplain and he authorized
Me to send for my Ebony Eyes

My Ebony Eyes was coming to me
From out of the skies on Flight 1203
In an hour or two, I would whisper “I do”
To my beautiful Ebony Eyes

Spoken:
The plane was way overdue,
So I went inside to the airline’s desk and I said:
“Sir, I wonder why 1203 is so late”
He said: “Oh they probably took off late,
or they may have run into some turbulent weather and had to alter the course”

I went back outside and waited at the gate
and I watched the beacon light from the control tower
as it whipped through the dark ebony skies if it were searching for –

Sung:(My Ebony Eyes)

And then came the announcement over the loudspeaker,
“Would those having relatives or friends on Flight number 1203
please report to the chapel across the street at once”

Then I felt a burning break deep inside
And I knew the heavenly ebony skies
Had taken my life’s most wonderful prize
My beautiful Ebony Eyes

If I ever get, to heaven I’ll bet
The first angel I’ll recognise
She’ll smile at me and I know she will be
My beautiful Ebony Eyes

Oh, don't you know, don't you know you'll be my ruin?
You've got me crying, crying again
When will you let this heartache end?

Why make me remember what I wanna forget?
I've been lonely, lonely too long
Emotions, please leave me alone

Let me forget that I made a mistake
Oh, can't you see what you're doin' to me?
