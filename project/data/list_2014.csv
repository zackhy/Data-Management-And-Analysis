1,Pharrell Williams,Happy,2014,"It might seem crazy what I am about to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way

Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

2,Meghan Trainor,All About That Bass,2014,"Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

Yeah it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
All the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real
Come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says ""boys they like a little more booty to hold at night""
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into
Then go ahead and move along

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches ""Hey""
No, I'm just playing I know you think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you that
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size

3,Sam Smith,Stay With Me,2014,"Guess it's true
I'm not good at a one night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave
Will you hold my hand

Oh, won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Why am I so emotional?!
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
Deep down I know this never works?
But you could lay with me
So it doesn't hurt

Oh, won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Oooh oh ooh oooh ooooh oh
Oooh oh ooh oooh ooooh oh

Oh, won't you stay with me

4,Nico & Vinz,Am I Wrong,2014,"Am I wrong
For thinking out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong
For saying that I choose another way?
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing
Just 'cause everybody doing what they all do
If one thing I know,
I'll fall but I'll grow
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home

So am I wrong?
For thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong?
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel,
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see

Am I tripping
For having a vision?
My prediction:
I'ma be on the top of the world
Walk your walk and don't look back,
Always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel
Fight for yours and don't let go,
Don't let them compare you, no
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel

Am I wrong? (Am I wrong?)
For thinking that we could be something for real?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)
Now am I wrong?

But that's just how I feel,
That's just how I feel

Trying to reach the things that I can't see

Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, they speak it depart it
Swagger on super, I can't shop at no department
better get my money on time, if they not money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?

Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch
Ow...

Still stuntin', how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at it I bet you wishing you could clutch that
It's just the way you like it, huh?
You're so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?
Never turn down nothing,
Slaying these hoes, gold trigger on the gun like

8,Ariana Grande & Iggy Azalea,Problem,2014,"It's Iggy Iggz
I got one more problem with you girl
Aye

Hey baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya, I want you
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to, I want you
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why did you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it, I want you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up, but it's you?
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back, but it's you
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it, but it's you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders

Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boy, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what!

9,Ed Sheeran,Sing,2014,"It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now

And I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the programme
I want you to be mine, lady
And to hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time, lady

I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothing to say
And nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke

Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing ""we found love in a local rave"", no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and then hope and pray

I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now
Not sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth

I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
I found you hiding here so won't you take my hand, darling?
Before the beat kicks in again

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Sing!
I need you, darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?

You were gonna come to me

Of anything and everything

'Cause her love was so strong

You may fall in love
When you meet her

She'll turn cold as a freezer

11,Taylor Swift,Blank Space,2014,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face!""
You look like my next mistake

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever

14,Idina Menzel,Let It Go,2014,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door

I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway"

Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

Oh baby why did you run away?
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you'd have my back
So I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

pulling against the stream, pullin against the stream.

Easy to love me, love me.

29,Justin Timberlake,Not a Bad Thing,2014,"Said all I want from you
Is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you'll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
An while we're at it throw in every other day to start

I know people make promises all the time

Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife and you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you're worth it

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me

Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me

Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?

And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
'Cause I know that's a good place to start

I know people make promises all the time

Then they turn right around and break them
Then someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
Cause baby you're worth it

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me

Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just find out my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me

No I won't fill your mind with broken promises
And wasted time
And if you fall
You'll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine
Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me"

Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all"
38,Ella Henderson,Ghost,2014,"I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

My friends had you figured out
Yeah they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through

These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake

I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name

And that's when my love was burning
Yeah it's still burning

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away

It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
Guess I love living in the sin

Oh you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learn

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

Give off the ghost
Give off the ghost
Give off the ghost
Stop the haunting baby

Give off the ghost
Give off the ghost
Give off the ghost
No more haunting baby

I keep going to the river

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

48,Sara Bareilles,Brave,2014,"You can be amazing 
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug 
You can be the outcast 
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love 
Or you can start speaking up 
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do 
And they settle ‘neath your skin 
Kept on the inside and no sunlight 
Sometimes a shadow wins 
But I wonder what would happen if you 

Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave 

With what you want to say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

By the enemy 
Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing 
Bow down to the mighty 
Don’t run, stop holding your tongue 
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live 
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in 
Show me how big your brave is 

Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave 

With what you want to say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave 

Innocence, your history of silence 
Won’t do you any good 
Did you think it would? 
Let your words be anything but empty 
Why don’t you tell them the truth? 

Say what you wanna say

49,Ed Sheeran,Don't,2014,"La, la, la, la

I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait

But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon & a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
She's singing...
la, la, la, la
Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that, babe

la, la, la

Don't with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim & reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

la, la, la

For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place & loves the way I treat her

Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me & her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day

And those shows have never been what it's about
Maybe we'll go together & just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you & sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now

Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how I was confused about
She should figure it out why I'm sat here singing

Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim & reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

On my hotel door!
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told you
Trust & respect is what we do this for

I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course

It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun & I thought you were different

This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing

Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim & reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own

Because he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not

So, what, what do you think?
Did, did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Do you see her?
She's so short, and that dress is so tacky
Who wears cheetah?

Can we go smoke a cigarette?
I really need one
But first, let me take a selfie

Let me take a selfie

Can you guys help me pick a filter?

I want to look tan
What should my caption be?
I want it to be clever

How about ""Living with my bitches, #live""?
I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes
Do you think I should take it down?
Let me take another selfie

Is that guy sleeping over there?
Yeah, the one next to the girl with no shoes on

She definitely bought all her Instagram followers

Inside my Cadillac, That is my shit
And I throw it up (I throw that up)
That's what it is (that's what it is)
In my C A D I L L A C bitch (biatch)
Can't see me through my tints (nah ah)
I'm riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint wet drippin shorty like my 24's (umbrella)
I ain't got 24's (no oh)
But I'm on those Vogues
That's those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I'm rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y'all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm blowin' that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Man I'm lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would've been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that's stylish
Smilin', don't pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I'm illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I'm smashing
I'm ducking bucking them out here
I'm lookin fuckin fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it's like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yea, I'm from Seattle, There's hella Honda Civics
I couldn't tell you about paint neither
But I really want the Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I'm dreaming of, i bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming

Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm blowin' that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had it hella my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone
Sendin' portions of his liquor, water in the Patrón
Rather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it and the vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keeping the buns on ‘em
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin like we ball
Tryna fuck em all, kill the fuckin wimps
See what's poppin' at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my palms
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe... some
swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Girl does she want it low?
This shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slide till the gas is finished, Q

It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh Glory

Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon
Formed against, yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings

The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough

One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
Truant livin' livin' in us, resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up

When it go down we woman and man up
They say, ""Stay down"", and we stand up
Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up
""King"" pointed to the mountain top and we ran up

One day when the Glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day, when the war is done
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh... Glory

Now the war is not over, victory isn't won
And we'll fight on to the finish, then when it's all done
We'll cry glory, oh glory
We'll cry glory, oh glory

Selma is now for every man, woman and child
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now
Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles

From dark roads he rose, to become a hero
Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people
Enemy is lethal, a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle

The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history

No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
Comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the Glory

One day when the Glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day, when the war is done
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh, Glory

When the war is won
When it's all said and done
We'll cry Glory, oh Glory"

And love is the prize
