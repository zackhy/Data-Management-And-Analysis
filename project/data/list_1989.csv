1,Madonna,Like a Prayer,1989,"Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying

I close my eyes
Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing

It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there
Like a prayer

Just like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there"
2,Phil Collins,Another Day in Paradise,1989,"She calls out to the man on the street
""Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?""

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
He starts to whistle as he crosses the street
She's embarrassed to be there

Oh, think twice, it's just another day for
For you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day
For you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been cryin'
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's tryin'

Oh, just think twice, it's just another day
For you and me in paradise
Oh, yes think twice, it's just another day
For you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it, just think about it

Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh Lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell by the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh, yes think twice, it's just another day
For you and me in paradise
Oh, yes think twice, it's just another day
For you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it, just think about it

It's just another day
For you and me in paradise
It's just another day
For you and me in paradise
It's just another day
For you and me in paradise
It's just another day
For you and me in paradise
It's just another day
For you and me
It's another day
For you and me
It's another day
For you and me in paradise
In paradise"
3,Roxette,The Look,1989,"Walking like a man
Hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter
Tasty like a raindrop
She's got the look
Heavenly bound

'Cause heaven's got a number

I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la

She's got the look
Fire in the ice
Naked to the T-bone
Is a lover's disguise
Bangin' on the head drum
Shakin' like a mad bull
She's got the look
Swayin' to the band
Movin' like a hammer
She's a miracle man
Lovin' is the ocean
Kissin' is the wet sand

4,Fine Young Cannibals,She Drives Me Crazy,1989,"I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real

Tell me what you've got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waiting 'round's killing me

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed

Everything you say is lies
But to me there's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself"
5,The Bangles,Eternal Flame,1989,"Close your eyes, give me your hand, darlin'
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Is this burning an eternal flame

I believe it's meant to be, darlin'
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming

Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling, oh

6,Richard Marx,Right Here Waiting,1989,"Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
Then how can we say forever?

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it baby?
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it baby?
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

you would break my heart

you put your spell on me
took my breath away

12,Mike & The Mechanics,The Living Years,1989,"Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my Father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thoughts
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talkin' in defense

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So Don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different date
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be O.K.

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning
When my Father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

Say it loud, say it clear
Say it loud
Don't give up
Don't give in"
13,Madonna,Express Yourself,1989,"Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no, no

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed

You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey

So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Oh, baby ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

To express himself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey

So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Baby ready or not

Express yourself
Respect yourself
Hey, hey

(So if you want it right now)
(Then make him show you how)
Express what he's got
Oh, baby ready or not

Express yourself"

You will never never never know me

All the things
That we've been through
You should understand me
Like I understand you
Now girl I know the difference
Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing
To break up our happy home
Don't get so excited
When I come home
A little late at night
Cos we only act like children

When we argue fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

We've all got our
Own funny moods
I've got mine
Woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
It should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together

Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When you can't see eye to eye
If you don't know me by now
You will never
Never never know me"

When love was wilder than the wind

They look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention
Food goes to waste!

So nice to eat, so nice to taste
Politician Grannie with your high ideals
Have you no idea how the Majority feels?
So without love and a promise land
We're fools to the rules of a Goverment plan
Kick out the style! Bring back the jam!

The birds and the bees

My girlfriend and me in love
Feel the pain

Talk about it
If you're a worried man - then shout about it
Open hearts - feel about it
Open minds - think about it
Everyone - read about it

Everyone - scream about it!
Everyone
Everyone - read about it, read about it
Read in the books in the crannies and the nooks there are books to read!

And the lovetrain rides from coast to coast
Every minute of every hour

And I believe in lovepower, Love power, LOOOOOVEPOWER!!!

Has gone away, I don't want to know why
She's gone away I don't know where
Somewhere I can't follow her

The one good thing didn't stay too long
My back was turned and she was gone

Good thing where have you gone?
My good thing you've been gone too long

People say I should forget
There's plenty more don't get upset
People say she's doin' fine
Mutual friends I see sometime

That's not what I want to hear
I want to hear she wants me near

Good thing where have you gone?
My good thing you've been gone too long?

Then one day she came back
I was so happy that I didn't ask
Morning came into my room
Caught me dreaming like a fool

Good thing, good thing
My, my, my, my good thing where have you gone?
My good thing, my good thing, girl where have you gone?
It's been so long

28,Chicago,Look Away,1989,"When you called me up this morning
Told me 'bout the new love you found
I said, ""I'm happy for you

Found someone else
I guess I won't be coming 'round
I guess it's over, baby
It's really over, baby

And from what you said, I know you've gotten over me
It'll never be the way it used to be
So if it's gotta be this way
Don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay

But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away

And if we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away

Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

When we both agreed as lovers
We were better off as friends
That's how it had to be
Yeah, that's how it had to be

I tell you I'm fine
But sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me
Wish you were still holding me

I just never thought that I would be replaced so soon
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you
I know I wanted to be free
Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be

But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away

And if we meet on the streets someday

Workin' all week
9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes
I go get live with the honey

Rollin' down the street
I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye, she got into the ride
Went to a club was jumpin'

Introduce myself as Loc
She said, ""You're a liar""
I said, ""I got it goin' on baby doll
And I'm on fire""

Took her to the hotel she said
""You're the king""
I said, ""Be my queen if you know what I mean
And let us do the wild thing

Wild thing
Wild thing

Shoppin' at the mall
Looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world
And I had to adjust my fly

She looked at me and smiled and said
""You have plans for the night""
I said, ""Hopefully if things go
Well, I'll be with you tonight""

So we journeyed to her house
One thing led to an other
I keyed the door, I cold hit the floor
Looked up and it was her mother

I didn't know what to say
I was hanging by a string
She said, ""Hey, you two, I was once like you
And I liked to do the wild thing""

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please, baby, baby, please

Posse in effect
Hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig
I want a girl who's just my type

Saw this luscious little frame
I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss
And I knew that she was mine

Took her to the limousine
Still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over
And I gave her my own ride

Couldn't get her off my jack
She was like static cling
But that's what happens
When body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please, baby, baby, please

Wild thing

Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said, ""Chill for now but maybe later, you'll get your chance""

So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said, ""Tone, let me tell you one thing
I need Dollar 50 to make you holler, I get paid to do the wild thing""

Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby

Keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something's gotten into my life
Cutting it's way through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up, and turning me down
Making me smile, and making me frown

In a world that was war
I once lived in a time that was peace and no troubles at all
But then you came my way
And a feeling of unknown shook my heart,
made me want you to stay
All of my nights, and all of my days

Something's gotten hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
Yeah, something has invaded my night

Changing the grey, and changing the blue
Scarlet for me, and scarlet for you

I got to know if this is the real thing
I got to know it's making my heart sing

Every hour, every day
You touch me and my mind goes astray, yeah

And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore

48,Guns n' Roses,Patience,1989,We do not have the lyrics for Patience yet.
49,Young MC,Bust a Move,1989,"This here’s a jam for all the fellas
Tryin’ to do what those ladies tell us.
Get shot down ’cause you’re overzealous,
Play hard to get, females get jealous.
OK smarty, go to a party,
Girls are scantily clad and showin’ body.
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her,
But you’re standin’ on the wall like you was Poindexter.

Next day’s function, high class luncheon,
Food is served and you’re stone cold munchin’.
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants.
A girl starts walkin’, guys start gawkin’,
Sits down next to you and starts talkin’.
Says she wanna dance ’cause she likes the groove,
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move.

(vocal scatting)
Just bust a move!

You’re on a mission and you’re wishin’
Someone could cure your lonely condition.
Lookin’ for love in all the wrong places,
No fine girls, just ugly faces.
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation.
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope,
So don’t hang yourself with a celibate rope.

New movie’s showin’, so you’re goin’
Could care less about the five you’re blowin’
Theatre gets dark just to start the show
Then you spot a fine woman sittin’ in your row
She’s dressed in yellow, she says “Hello,
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!”
You run over there without a second to lose,
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move!

If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move!)
If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it.

In the city, ladies look pretty.
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty.
Tell a funny joke just to get some play,
Then you try to make a move and she says, “no way.”
Girls are fakin’, goodness sakin’,
They want a man who brings home the bacon.
Got no money and you got no car,
Then you got no woman and there you are.

Some girls are sophistic, materialistic,
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic.
They’re lyin’ on the beach perpetratin’ a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man.
So on the beach you’re strollin’, real high-rollin’,
Everything you have is yours and not stolen.
A girl runs up with somethin’ to prove,
So don’t just stand there, bust a move!

If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Break it down for me fellas)

(vocal scatting)

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry,
In five days from now he’s gonna marry.
He’s hopin’ you can make it there if you can,
‘Cause in the ceremony you’ll be the best man.
You say neato, check your libido,
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo.
The bride walks down just to start the wedding,
And there’s one more girl you won’t be getting.
So you start thinkin’, then you start blinkin’.
A bride maid looks and thinks that you’re winkin’.
She thinks you’re kinda cute so she winks back,
And now you’re feelin really fine ’cause the girl is stacked.
Reception’s jumpin’, bass is pumpin’,
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin’.
Says she wants to dance to a different groove.
Now you know what to do, G, bust a move!

If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Move it, boy)

59,Metallica,One,1989,"I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside, I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops with me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left to me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please God, wake me

Back in the womb, it's much to real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I lived

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a war time novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this shit off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please God, wake me
Please God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please God, help me, help me

Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body, my holding cell

Land mine has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul
Leaving me with a life in Hell

Oh, please God, help me
Help me"
60,Poison,Every Rose Has It's Thorn,1989,"We both lie silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart, inside
Was it somethin' I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right??
Tho' I tried not to hurt you
Tho' I tried
But I guess that's why they say
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yea it does
I listen to our favorite song playin' on the radio
Hear the dj say love's a game of
Easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow I guess
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains.
I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd know what to say
Instead of making love
We both made our separate ways
Now I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife, i guess
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn"

62,Tone Loc,Funky Cold Medina,1989,"Alright, dig it

Cold coolin' at a bar, and I'm lookin' for some action
But like Mike Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction
The girls are all around, but none of them wanna get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin' def, yo, what's up with L O C?

The girls is all jockin' at the other end of the bar
Havin' drinks with some no name chump
When they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?"" he said, ""Funky Cold Medina""

Funky Cold Medina

This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap

So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me
And did the wild thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina

You know what I'm sayin'?
I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin' down my door
I got Spuds McKenzie
Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal

I went up to this girl, she said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina
She said, ""I'd like a drink,"" I said, ""Ehm okay, I'll go get it""
Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips
And I knew that she was with it

So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener
You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina

You know, ain't no plans with a man
This is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies
Ya know?

Break it down

Back in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on, The Love Connection
The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner

She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'
Instead she started talkin' 'bout plans for our weddin'
I said, ""Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya""
That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina

Ya, know what I'm sayin'
That Medina's a monster, y'all

And rolled beneath a deep blue sky?
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standing by

When happily ever after fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly

Aah, but I know a place where we can go
That's still untouched by men
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind

And you can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense but this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

Oh, beautiful for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king

Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie

Aah, but I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind

Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense but this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast
But somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us

I need to remember this
So baby, give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye

Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense, this is the end
This is the end of the innocence"

Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed

Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do, when I realize with fright
That the spider man is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes

""Be still, be calm, be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spider man is having you for dinner tonight""

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the spider man is always hungry

Every journey always brings me back to you.

Dear God, I remember when times was hard
Gunshots echoed the block like passin' cars
I miss my cousin Lance look out for him
I love him, he died so young you musta had a place for him
My Uncle Kevin, the family miss him
He in Heaven, I ain't really understand 'till I turned seven
Every year that go by
I try to understand why (I understand why)
Everytime someone born, somebody gotta die
It's sad, I hate to see my mama cry
It's okay, come here mom and wipe your eyes
It's hard ta focus, kids playin' in school thinkin' they soldiers
Teachers can't teach now they nervous
Sittin' there thinkin' ta myself what we do to deserve this
Seein' kids die for no purpose (I don't know)
Sittun' there thinkin' ta myself what we do to deserve this
Seein' kids die for no purpose

The fast life is much too short, that's what we all thought
In and out of courts for assualts of all sorts
Seein' you go had me feelin' low
Just ta know a brotha was about to blow
But the world was killin' him slow
Your fans miss you wit a passion
And they wonder are you still alive and still laughin'
I still stress over your death
Caught four in to your chest
Lay your rest to the west
May your soul be blessed
And Lord knows how we miss you
Murder is a big issue
Can't stop the blood wit tissue
When the slugs hit you
All your family and friends shed tears
Cause for years
We knew you would make it, it was clear
Toast to both coasts
We need to stand close
Cause it ain't no silence when God is right in front of your eyes
Awakin' the time to shine
In time you'll find
I roll a dutch
Cause the worlds to much, to take my pain away

[Chorus: Repeat 4x]

I shed tears for da world.Death carries no age limit.

94,Neneh Cherry,Manchild,1989,"Okay, you're on your own, it's late
Your girlfriend is on another date with the hero in your dream
Turn around, ask yourself
So, you think you're gonna win this time Manchild?

Is it the pain of the drinking
Or the Sunday sinking feeling
The car never seems to work
When it's late your girlfriend's on a date

And the hero with her in your dream
In your sleep it seemed to like you
Turn around and ask yourself
Turn around ask yourself

Manchild, will you ever win?
Manchild, look at the state you're in

Could you go undercover
And sell your brand new lover
Could you be someone else for a night?
Maybe someone else will love you

You sell your soul for a tacky song
Like the one you hear on the radio
Turn around ask yourself
Turn around and ask yourself

Manchild, will you ever win
Manchild, look at the state you're in
Manchild, he will make you cry
Manchild, Manchild, Manchild

From Monday down to Friday
You're working on another man's car
Or is it in the factory?
It doesn't matter where you are

Just turn around and ask yourself is this communication
Accentuate the positive and give some illustration
See Manchild, you're no one, you turn the microphone on
Control communication when I'm kickin' it and so on
To the point that I need, the air that I breathe

Into an audience that's waiting and ecstatic to receive
For the meantime another mean rhyme, I keep on sayin' it
I know what the time is the crowd will keep playing it
Through the speaker boxes loud's my diagnosis

'Cause I believe in miracles and words in heavy doses
Enough R E S P E and C T
Respect yourself express no stress the mike is easy
Just believe that all you need is the air that you breathe
Turn around ask yourself

Manchild, will you ever win?
Manchild, look at the state you're in
Manchild, he will make you cry
Manchild, Manchild, Manchild
He's the apple of your eye

Once bitten twice shy, why don't you bite me again
Just take it in the right and go tell your friend
Are you ready for the words I turn the microphone on
A figure of speech to reach you at the back and so on

The style I'm stimulating dance floors
Raise your body temperature now and
This demands for power in the amp you know lauds my diagnosis
'Cause I believe in miracles and words in heavy doses"
95,De La Soul,"Me, Myself & I",1989,"Hit it now

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror what is wrong?
Can it be my De La clothes
Or is it just my De La song?

What I do ain't make-believe
People say I sit and try
When it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull

Always pushing that we've formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please, oh, please let Plug Two be
Himself not what you read or write

Right is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of showbiz

De La Soul is from the soul
And this fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Glory, glory Hallelu
Glory for Plugs One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By kizids and dookie eyes

People think they dis my person
By stating I'm darkly pack
I know this so I point at Q Tip
And he states, ""Black is black""

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Please keep on up with the nuts
So I don't get in aftermath

But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the fourth day of July
'Cause they tried to mess with
Third degree, that's me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I"

You say you want your story to remain untold

But all the promises we make from the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it all the riches in the night
You say you'll give me eyes in a moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness, a harbour in the tempest

But all the promises we make from the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you want your love to work out right
To last with me through the night
You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold, your love not to grow cold

All the promises we break from the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

98,Paul McCartney,My Brave Face,1989,"My brave, my brave, my brave face

I've been livin' in style, unaccustomed as I am to the luxury life
I've been hittin' the town and it didn't hit back
I've been doin' the rounds, unaccustomed as I am to the time on my hands
Now, I don't have to tell anybody when I'm gonna get back

Ever since you went away, I've had this sentimental
Inclination not to change a single thing
As I pull the sheets back on the bed
I want to go bury my head in your pillow

Now that I'm alone again, I can't stop breakin' down again
The simplest things set me off again and take me to that place
Where I can't find my brave face, where I can't find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face, my brave face

I've been livin' a lie, unaccustomed as I am to the work of a housewife
I've been breakin' up, dirty dishes and they throwin' them away

Ever since you left I have been tryin' to compose
A, baby will you please come home, note meant for you
As I clear away another untouched TV dinner
From the table, I laid for two

Now that I'm alone again, I can't stop breakin' down again
The simplest things set me off again, take me to that place
Where I can't find my brave face, where I can't find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face, my brave face"
