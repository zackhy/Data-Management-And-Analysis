I went back outside and waited at the gate. and I watched the beacon light from the control tower. as it whipped through the dark ebony skies if it were searching for –. Sung:(My Ebony Eyes). And then came the announcement over the loudspeaker,. “Would those having relatives or friends on Flight number 1203. please report to the chapel across the street at once”.

Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou. Savin' nickels, savin' dimes. Workin' till the sun don't shine. Lookin' forward to happier times on Blue Bayou. I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou. Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou. All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see. That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be. Oh, to see my baby again. And to be with some of my friends. Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou. I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on Blue Bayou. Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou. Ah, that girl of mine by my side, the silver moon and the evening tide. Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside. I'll never be blue, my dreams come true. On Blue BayouThe days of wine and roses. Laugh and run away like a child at play. Through the meadow land toward a closing door. A door marked 'Nevermore' that wasn't there before. The lonely night discloses. Just a passing breeze filled with memories. Of the golden smile that introduced me to. The days of wine and roses and youI like it, I like it.

But a spark still burned so I used my knife. And late that night, I saved the life of Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. I nursed him till the danger passed. The days went by, he mended fast. Then from dawn till setting sun. He practiced with that deadly gun. And hour on hour, I watched in awe. No human being could match the draw of Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. One day, we rode the mountain crest. And I went east and he went west. I took to law and wore a star. While he spread terror near and far. With lead and blood, he gained such fame. All thought the West they feared the name of Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. I knew someday, I'd face the test. Which one of us would be the best. And sure enough the word came down. That he was holed up in the town. I left the posse out in the street. And I went in alone to meet Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. They said my speed was next to none. But my lightning draw had just begun. When I heard a blast that stung my wrist. The gun went flying from my fist. And I was looking down the bore. Of the deadly .44 of Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. They say that was the only time. That anyone had seen him smile. He slowly lowered his gun and then. He said to me, "We're even, friend". And so at last, I understood. That there was still a spark of good in Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. I blocked the path of his retreat. He turned and stepped into the street. A dozen guns spit fire and lead. A moment later, he lay dead. The town began to shout and cheer. Nowhere was there shed a tear for Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. The story spread throughout the land. That I had beaten Ringo's hand. And it was just the years, they say. That made me put my guns away. But on his grave they can't explain. The tarnished star above the name of Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. Ringo, RingoYou're my world. You're every breath I take. You're my world. You're every move I make. Other eyes see the. Stars up in the sky. But for me they shine. Within your eyes. As the trees reach. For the sun above. So my arms reach out. To you for love. With your hand. Resting in mine. I feel a power so divine. You're my world. You are my night and day. You're my world. You're every prayer I pray. If our love ceases to be. Then it's the end of. My world for me. With your hand. Resting in mine. I feel a power so divine. You're my world. You are my night and day. You're my world. You're every prayer I pray. If our love ceases to be. Then it's the end of my world. End of my world. End of my world for meI love you, there's nothing to hide. It's better than burning inside. I love you, no use to pretend. There! I've said it again. I've said it, what more can I say?. Believe me, there's no other way. I love you, I will to the end. There! I've said it again. I try to drum up. A phrase that will sum up. All that I feel for you. But what good are phrases?. The thought that amazes. Is that you love me. And it's heavenly. Forgive me for wanting you so. But one thing I want you to know. I've loved you since heaven knows when. There! I've said it againUna lacrima sul viso misted on your pretty face babe. Makes me realize things. I never knew might mean something to you. One tear on your pretty face babe.

Alone, alone, alone. There never was, there couldn't be. A place in time for men like me. Who'd drink the dark and laugh at day. And let their wildest dreams blow away. That time has a way of changing a man throughout the years. And now I'm rearranging my life through all my tears. Alone, alone, alone. So now I'm old, I'm wise, I'm smart. I'm just a man with half a heart. I wonder how it might have been. And I hadn't cast my fate to the wind. To the wind, to the wind.Every day when the work is behind you. and the shop and the store put the lock on the door,. just get away where your worries won't find you.. If you like, well, I'll tell you more.. Don't let the day get the better of you.. When the evening comes, there's so much to do!. You'd better put on your best and wear a smile.. Come along with me a while. 'cause I tell you. CHORUS:. I know a place. where the music is fine and the lights are always low!. I know a place. where we can go.. At the door there's a man who will greet you.. Then you go downstairs to some tables and chairs.. Soon, I'm sure, you'll be tapping your feet. because the beat is the greatest there.. All around there are girls and boys.. It's a swingin' place,. a cellar full of noise!. It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow.. You gotta come along right now!. 'Cause I tell you. CHORUS. - musical interlude -. Well, all around there are girls and boys.. It's a swingin' place,. a cellar full of noise.. It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow.. You've gotta come along right now!. 'Cause I tell you. CHORUS. I know a place where we can go!. I know a place where the lights are low!. I know a place where we can go!. I know a place where the lights are low!. (repeat and fade out)Sandie Shaw. Miscellaneous. Long Live Love.                 Venus must have heard my plea . She has sent someone along for me . .

All around, people looking half dead. Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head. But at night it's a different world. Go out and find a girl. Come on, come on and dance all night. Despite the heat it'll be alright. And babe, don't you know it's a pity. That the days can't be like the nights. In the summer, in the city. In the summer, in the city. Cool town, evening in the city. Dressing so fine and looking so pretty. Cool cat, looking for a kitty. Gonna look in every corner of the city. Till I'm wheezing like a bus stop.

The company was gay, we'd turn night into day. But all that's left is a place dark and lonely. A terraced house in a mean street back of town. Becomes a shrine when I think of you only.

Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doin'. One lazy afternoon down Savannah way. They robbed a store. And high-tailed outa that town. Got clean away in a stolen car. And waited till the heat died down. Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation. And made the graduation into the banking business. "Reach for the sky," sweet-talking Clyde would holler. As Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag. Now one brave man. He tried to take 'em alone. They left him lyin' in a pool of blood. And laughed about it all the way home. Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one. Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun. They used to laugh about dyin'. But deep inside 'em they knew that pretty soon they'd be lyin'. Beneath the ground together. Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun and the morning dew. Acting upon reliable information. A federal deputation laid a deadly ambush. When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine. A half a dozen carbines opened up on them. Bonnie and Clyde, they lived a lot together. And finally together they diedLove is like candy on a shelf. You want to taste and help yourself.

That from her western shores. Those beautiful sailors journeyed. To the South and the North Americas with ease. In their ships with painted sails. To the East, Africa was a neighbour. Across a short strait of sea miles. The great Egyptian age is but a remnant. Of The Atlantian culture. The antediluvian kings colonised the world. All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas. In all legends, from all lands, were from far Atlantis. Knowing her fate. Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth. On board were the Twelve. The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician. And the other so-called Gods of our legends. Though Gods they were. And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind. Let us rejoice, and let us sing, and dance. And ring in the new. Hail, Atlantis!. Way down below the ocean. Where I wanna be, she may be. Way down below the ocean. Where I wanna be, she may be.

Goodbye.... Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, GoodbyeAnd now the end is near. And so I face the final curtain. My friend, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case of which I'm certain. I've lived a life that's full. I've travelled each and every highway. and more, much more than this. I did it my way. Regrets I've had a few. But then again too few to mention. I did what I had to do. And saw it through without exemption. I planned each chartered course. Each careful step along the by-way. And more, much more than this. I did it my way. Yes, there were times. I'm sure you knew. When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all when there was doubt. I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all. And I stood tall. And did it my way. I've loved, I've laughed, and cried. I've had my fill, my share of losing. And now, as tears subside. I find it all so amusing. To think I did all that. And may I say, not in a shy way. "Oh no, oh no, not me. I did it my way". For what is a man, what has he got?. If not himself then he has naught. To say the things he truly feels. And not the words of one who kneels. The record shows I took the blows. And did it my way. Yes, it was my way{melody}. . Love is but a song we sing, fear's the way we die..

While I live right above you. I can hear your music playin'. I can feel your body swayin'. One floor below me. You don't even know me, I love you. Oh, my darling, knock three times. On the ceiling if you want me. Twice on the pipe. If the answer is no. Oh, my sweetness. Means you'll meet me in the hallway. Oh, twice on the pipe. Means you ain't gonna show. If you look out your window tonight. Pull in the string with the note. That's attached to my heart. Read how many times I saw you. How in my silence I adored you. And only in my dreams did.

But you know I keep thinking about. Making my way back. Well, I'm New York City born and raised. But nowadays, I'm lost between two shores. LA's fine, but it ain't home.

Leavin' me lonely still. Did you ever read about a frog who dreamed of being a king. And then became one. Well, except for the names and a few other changes. If you talk about me, the story's the same one. But I got an emptiness deep inside. And I've tried but it won't let me go. And I'm not a man who likes to swear. But I've never cared for the sound of being alone. I am, I said. To no one there. And no one heard at all. Not even the chair. I am, I cried. I am, said I. And I am lost, and I can't even say why.

Preach a little gospel, sell a couple bottles of Doctor Good. Gypsys, tramps, and thieves. We'd hear it from the people of the town. They'd call us gypsys, tramps, and thieves. But every night all the men would come around. And lay their money down. Picked up a boy just south of Mobile. Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal. I was sixteen, he was twenty-one. Rode with us to Memphis. And Papa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done. Gypsys, tramps, and thieves. We'd hear it from the people of the town. They'd call us gypsys, tramps, and thieves. But every night all the men would come around. And lay their money down. I never had schoolin' but he taught me well. With his smooth southern style. Three months later I'm a girl in trouble.

Robbing from an old hen. Old McDonald he made us work. But then he paid us for what it was worth. Another tank of gas. And back on the road again. I'll never forget the day. We motored stately into big L.A.. The lights of the city put settlin'. Down in my brain. Though it's only been a month or so. That old car's buggin' us to go. We've gotta get away and get back on. The road againSha la la lala lalala. Sha la la lala lalala. Sha la la lala lalala.

REPEAT AND FADETalkin' to myself and feelin' old. Sometimes I'd like to quit, nothin' ever seems to fit. Hangin' around, nothin' to do but frown. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down. What I've got they used to call the blues. Nothin' is really wrong, feelin' like I don't belong. Walkin' around, some kind of lonely clown. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down. Funny, but it seems I always wind up here with you. Nice to know somebody loves me. Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do. Run and find the one who loves me. What I feel has come and gone before. No need to talk it out. We know what it's all about. Hangin' around. Nothin' to do but frown. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.

And visit a nearby tower. And climbing to the top, will throw myself off. In an effort to make it clear. To who ever what it's like when you're shattered. Left standing in the lurch at a church. Where people saying, "My God, that's tough. She's stood him up no point in us remaining. We may as well go home". As I did on my own alone again, naturally. To think that only yesterday. I was cheerful, bright and gay. Looking forward to well who wouldn't do. The role I was about to play. But as if to knock me down reality came around. And without so much, as a mere touch. Cut me into little pieces leaving me to doubt. Talk about God in His mercy. Who if He really does exist. Why did he desert me in my hour of need. I truly am indeed, alone again, naturally. It seems to me that there are more hearts. Broken in the world that can't be mended. Left unattended. What do we do? What do we do?. Alone again, naturally. Now looking back over the years. And whatever else that appears. I remember I cried when my father died. Never wishing to hide the tears. And at sixty-five years old. My mother, God rest her soul. Couldn't understand why the only man. She had ever loved had been taken. Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken. Despite encouragement from me. No words were ever spoken and when she passed away. I cried and cried all day, alone again, naturally. Alone again, naturallyClair, the moment I met you. I swear I felt as if something. Somewhere had happened to me. Which I couldn't see. And then the moment I met you again. I knew in my heart that we were friends. It had to be so it couldn't be no. But try as hard as I might do. I don't know why you get to me. In a way I can't describe. Words mean so little. When you look up and smile. I don't care what people say to me. You're more than a child, oh Clair. Clair. Clair, if ever a moment so rare. Was captured for all to compare. That moment is you in all that you do. But why in spite of our age difference. Do I cry each time I leave you. I feel I could die. Nothing means more to me. Than hearing you say. â€½I'm going to marry you. Will you marry me, Uncle Ray?". Oh Clair, Clair. Clair I've told you before don't you dare. Get back into bed can't you see that is late. No you can't have a drink. Oh alright then, but wait just a bit. While I in an effort to baby sit. Capture my breath what there is left of it. You can be murder at this hour of the day. But in the morning tonight will seem a life time away. Oh Clair, ClairSong Sung Blue. Everybody knows one. Song Sung Blue. Every garden grows one. Me and you are subject to the blues now and then. But when you take the blues and make a song. You sing them out again. Sing them out again. Song Sung Blue. Weeping like a willow. Song Sung Blue. Sleeping on my pillow. Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice. And before you know, start to feeling good. You simply got no choice. [break].

When the only people that existed were troglodytes... cave men.... cave women... Neanderthal... troglodytes. Let's take the average. cave man at home, listening to his stereo. Sometimes he'd get up,. try to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this:. "Dance... dance". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look. in the mirror: "Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a. woman gotta find a woman". He'd go down to the lake where all the. woman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look. around and just reach in and grab one. "Come here... come here".. He'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause. it might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd. be swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there,. wet and frightened. He said: "Move... move". She got up. She was a. big woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one. of the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said:. "Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me. sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!". She looked down on him.. She was ready to crush him, but she began to like him. She said. (falsetto):. "I'll sock it to ya, Daddy". He said: "Wha?". She said (falsetto):. "I'll sock it to ya, Daddy". You know what he said? He started it way. back then. I wouldn't lie to you. When she said (falsetto). "I'll sock it to ya, Daddy" he said "Right on! Right on! Hotpants!. Hotpants!

Lets me know everything's all right. Summer breeze. Makes me feel fine. Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind. Summer breeze. Makes me feel fine. Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind. See the paper layin' on the sidewalk. A little music from the house next door. So I walk on up to the doorstep. Through the screen and across the floor. Summer breeze. Makes me feel fine. Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind. Summer breeze. Makes me feel fine. Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind. Sweet days of summer. The jasmine's in bloom. July is dressed up and playing her tune. And I come home from a hard day's work. And you're waiting there. Not a care in the world.... See the smile waitin' in the kitchen. Food cookin' and the plates for two.... Feel the arms that reach out to hold me. In the evening when the day is through. Summer breeze. Makes me feel fine. Blowing through the jasmine in my mind.

You don't know how many times. I wished that I could hold you. You don't know how many times. I've wished that I could mold you into someone. Who could cherish me as much as I cherish you. Perish is the word that more than applies. To the hope in my heart each time I realize. That I am not going to be the one. To share your dreams. That I am not going to be the one. To share your schemes. That I am not going to be the one. To share what seems to be the life. That you could cherish me as much as I do yours. Oh, I'm beginning to think. That man has never found. The words that could make you want me. That have the right amount of letters. Just the right sound. That could make you hear. Make you see. That you're driving me out of my mind. Oh I could say I need you. But then you'd realize that I want you. Just like a thousand other guys. Who say they'd love you. With all the rest of their lives. When all they wanted was to.

Flying too high can confuse me. Touch me but don't take me down. Whenever I, whenever I am away from you. My alibi is tellin' people I don't care for you. Maybe I'm just hanging around.

Telling my whole life with his words. Killing me softly with his song. I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd. I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.

Got the sun in my eyes. And I won't be surprised if it's a dream. . Everything I want the world to be. Is now coming true especially for me. And the reason is clear. It's because you are here. You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen. . I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation. And the only explanation I can find. Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around. Your love's put me at the top of the world. . Something in the wind has learned my name. And it's tellin' me that things are not the same. In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze. There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me. . There is only one wish on my mind. When this day is through I hope that I will find. That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me. All I need will be mine if you are here. . I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation. And the only explanation I can find. Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around.

It's a wonder I can think at all. And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none. I can read the writing on the wall. Kodachrome, they give us those nice bright colors. Gives those greens of summers. They make you think that all the world's a sunny day. Well I've got a, a Nikon camera. I love to take photographs. So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away. If you took all the girls I knew when I was single. Brought them all together for one night. They never matched my sweet imagination. And everything looks better in black and white. They give us those, those nice bright colors. Gives those greens of summers. They make you think that all the world's a sunny day. Well I've got a, a Nikon camera. I love to take photographs. So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away. Mama don't take my Kodachrome away. Don't take my Kodachrome away. Mama don't take my Kodachrome. Mama don't take my Kodachrome.

We've known each other since we were nine or ten. Together we climbed hills and trees. Learned of love and A, B, C's. Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees. Goodbye Emil, it's hard to die. When all the bird's are singing in the sky. Now that the spring is in the air. Pretty girls are everywhere. I wish we could both be there. We had joy, we had fun. We had seasons in the sun. But the hills we could climb. Were just seasons out of time. Goodbye Papa, please pray for me. I was the black sheep of the family. You tried to show me right from wrong. But too much wine and too much song. Wonder how I got along. Goodbye Papa, it's hard to die. When all the bird's are singing in the sky. Now that the spring is in the air. Little kids are everywhere. Think of me and I'll be there. We had joy, we had fun. We had seasons in the sun. But the wine and the song. Like the seasons have all gone. Goodbye Francoise, my trusted wife. Without you I'd had a lonely life. You cheated lots of times with them. But I forgave you in the end. Though your lover was my friend. Goodbye Francoise, it's hard to die. When all the birds are singing in the sky. Now that the spring is in the air. With your lovers everywhere. Just be careful, I'll be there. We had joy, we had fun. We had seasons in the sun. But the stars we could reach. Were just starfish on the beach. Goodbye Michelle, my little one. You gave me joy and helped me find the sun. And every time when I was down. You would always come around. And get my feet back on the groundMemories. Light the corners of my mind. Misty watercolor memories. Of the way we were. Scattered pictures. Of the smiles we left behind. Smiles we gave to one another. For the way we were. Can it be that it was all so simple then. Or has time rewritten every line. If we had the chance to do it all again. Tell me would we, could we. Memories. May be beautiful and yet. What's too painful to remember. We simply choose to forget. So it's the laughter. We will remember. Whenever we remember.

I'd hear her crying in the back room. Feel so distressed. And I'd remember back when she was five. To the words that used to make. Emmaline come alive. It was :. "Emmaline,. Emma, Emmaline,. I'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen.. Emmaline,. Emma, Emmaline. I'm gonna make you the biggest star this world has ever seen.". It was a cold and dark December night. When I opened up the bedroom door. To find her lying still and cold. Upon the bed. A love letter lying on the bedroom floor. It read :. "Darling I love you,.

I see your folks have gone away. Would you dance with me today?. I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie baby. When he walks in the room, he feels confused. Like he's walked into a play. And the music's so loud it spins him around. 'Til his soul has lost it's way. And as she turns the volume down. He's getting smaller with the sound. It seems to pull him off the ground. Toward the radio he's bound never to be found. The headlines read that a boy disappeared. And everyone thinks he died. 'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover. Who keeps her satisfied. It's so nice to be insane. No one asks you to explain. Radio by your side, Angie baby. Angie Baby, you're a special lady. Living in a world of make-believe.

Singin' them love songsI learned the truth at seventeen. That love was meant for beauty queens. And high school girls with clear skinned smiles. Who married young and then retired.. The valentines I never knew. The Friday night charades of youth. Were spent on one more beautiful. At seventeen I learned the truth. And those of us with ravaged faces. Lacking in the social graces. Desperately remained at home. Inventing lovers on the phone. Who called to say come dance with me. and murmured vague obscenities. It isn't all it seems. At seventeen. A brown eyed girl in hand me downs. Whose name I never could pronounce. Said, "Pity please the ones who serve,. They only get what they deserve". The rich relationed hometown queen. Marries into what she needs. With a guarantee of company. And haven for the elderly. Remember those who win the game. Lose the love they sought to gain. Indebentures of quality. And dubious integrity. Their small town eyes will gape at you. In dull surprise when payment due. Exceeds accounts received. At seventeen. To those of us who know the pain. of valentines that never came. And those whose names were never called. When choosing sides for basketball. It was long ago and far away. The world was younger than today. And dreams were all they gave for free. To ugly duckling girls like me. We all play the game and when we dare. To cheat ourselves at solitaire. Inventing lovers on the phone. Repenting other lives unknown. That call and say, come dance with me. and murmur vague obscenities. At ugly girls like me. At seventeenNAMy love must be a kind of blind love. I can't see anyone but you. . Are the stars out tonight?. I don't know if it's cloudy or bright. I only have eyes for you, dear. .

Day after day I'm still holdin' on. Even though you're goneI feel so bad I got a worried mind. I'm so lonesome all the time. Since I left my baby behind. On Blue Bayou. Saving nickles saving dimes. Working til the sun don't shine. Looking forward to happier times. On Blue Bayou. I'm going back someday. Come what may. To Blue Bayou. Where the folks are fine. And the world is mine. On Blue Bayou. Where those fishing boats. With their sails afloat. If I could only see. That familiar sunrise. Through sleepy eyes. How happy I'd be. Gonna see my baby again. Gonna be with some of my friends. Maybe I'll feel better again. On Blue Bayou. Saving nickles saving dimes. Working til the sun don't shine. Looking forward to happier times. On Blue Bayou. I'm going back someday. Come what may. To Blue Bayou. Where the folks are fine. And the world is mine. On Blue Bayou. Where those fishing boats. With their sails afloat. If I could only see. That familiar sunrise. Through sleepy eyes. How happy I'd be. Oh that boy of mine. By my side. The silver moon. And the evening tide. Oh some sweet day. Gonna take away. This hurting inside. Well I'll never be blue. My dreams come true. On Blue BayouOn a morning from a Bogart movie. In a country where they turn back time. You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre. Contemplating a crime. She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running. Like a watercolor in the rain. Don't bother asking for explanations. She'll just tell you that she came. In the year of the cat. She doesn't give you time for questions. As she locks up your arm in hers. And you follow till your sense of which direction. Completely disappears. By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls. There's a hidden door she leads you to. These days, she says, "I feel my life. Just like a river running through". The year of the cat. Why she looks at you so coolly?. And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea. She comes in incense and patchouli. So you take her, to find what's waiting inside. The year of the cat. Well morning comes and you're still with her. And the bus and the tourists are gone. And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket. So you have to stay on. But the drumbeat strains of the night remain. In the rhythm of the new-born day. You know sometime you're bound to leave her. But for now you're going to stay. In the year of the cat. Year of the catHoy en mi ventana brilla el sol. Y el corazon. Se pone triste. Contemplando la ciudad. Porque te vas. Como cada noche desperte. Pensando en ti. Y en mi reloj todas las horas vi pasar. Porque te vas. Todas las promesas de mi amor. Se iran contigo. Me olvidaras me olividaras. Junto a la estacion hoy. Ilorare idual que un nino. Porque te vas. Porque te vas. Porque te vas. Porque te vas. Porque te vas. Bajo la penumbra de un farol. Se dormiran.

Grand Prix Eurovision 1977 (c) 1976 by Éditions Do-Si-La Music. . 1 Comme un enfant aux yeux de lumière qui voit passer au loin les oiseaux.   Comme l'oiseau bleu survolant la terre, vois comme le monde, le monde est beau. . 2 Beau ce bateau dansant sur les vagues ivre de vie d'amour et de vent.   Belle la chanson naissante des vagues abandonnée au sable blanc. . 3 Blanc l'innocent le sang du poète qui en chantant invente l'amour.   Pour que la vie s'habille de fête et que la nuit se change en jour. . 4 Jour d'une vie où l'aube se lève pour réveiller la ville aux yeux lourds.   Où les matins effeuillent les rêves pour nous donner un mond' d'amour. . R	L'amour c'est toi, l'amour c'est moi. 	L'oiseau c'est toi, l'enfant c'est moi. . 5 Moi je ne suis qu'une fille de l'ombre qui voit briller l'étoile du soir.   Toi mon étoile qui tisse ma ronde viens allumer mon soleil noir. . 6 Noire la misère, les hommes et la guerre qui croient tenir les rênes du temps.   Pays d'amour n'a pas de frontière pour ceux qui ont un coeur d'enfant. . 7 Comme un enfant aux yeux de lumière qui voit passer au loin les oiseaux.   Comme l'oiseau bleu survolant la terre, nous trouverons ce monde amour. . R(Mmm mmm, mmm mmm). Slip sliding away. Slip slidin' away. You know the nearer your destination. The more you're slip slidin' away. I know a man. He came from my home town. He wore his passion for his woman. Like a thorny crown. He said, "Dolores, I live in fear". My love for you is so overpowering. I'm afraid that I will disappear. Slip sliding away. Slip slidin' away. You know the nearer your destination. The more you're slip sliding away. And I know a woman. Became a wife. These are the very words she uses. To describe her life. She said "A good day, ain't got no rain". She said "A bad day's when I lie in bed. And think of things that might have been". Slip sliding away. Slip slidin' away. (Ooh ooh). You know the nearer your destination. The more you're slip sliding away. And I know a father. Who had a son. He longed to tell him all the reasons. For the things he'd done. He came a long way, just to explain. He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping. Then he turned around and headed home again. He's slip slidin'. Slip sliding away. (Ooh ooh). You know the nearer your destination.   (Ooh ooh ooh). The more you're slip slidin' away. And God only knows. God makes his plan.

Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park. Summer night city. In the sun I feel like sleeping, I can't take it for too long. My impatience slowly creeping up my spine and growing strong. I know what's waiting there for me, tonight I'm loose and fancy-free. When the night comes with the action I just know it's time to go. Can't resist the strange attraction from that giant dynamo. Lots to take and lots to give, time to breathe and time to live. Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark. Summer night city. Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park. Summer night city. It's elusive call it glitter somehow something turns me on. Some folks only see the litter, we don't miss them when they're gone. I love the feeling in the air, my kind of people everywhere. When the night comes with the action I just know it's time to go. Can't resist the strange attraction from that giant dynamo. And tomorrow, when the dawning and the first birds start to sing. In the pale light of the morning nothings worth remembering. It's a dream, it's out of reach scattered driftwood on the beach.

Rairty she's the best!. Yeah!!You asked me if I love you, and I choke on my reply.. I'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie.. And who am I to judge you on what you say or do. I'm only just beginning to see the real you.. And sometimes when we touch. The honesty's too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide.. I wanna hold you till I die. Till we both break down and cry. I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.. Romance and all its strategy leaves me battling with my pride.. But through the insecurity some tenderness survives.. I'm just another writer, still trapped within my truths.. A hesitant prize fighter, still trapped within my youth.. And sometimes when we touch. The honesty's too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide.. I wanna hold you till I die. Till we both break down and cry. I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.. At times I'd like to break you and drag you to your knees.. At times I'd like to break through and hold you endlessly.. At times I understand you, and I know how hard you've tried.. I've watched while love commands you. And I've watched love pass you by.. At times I think we're drifters, still searching for a friend.. A brother or a sister, but then the passion flares again.. And sometimes when we touch. The honesty's too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide.. I wanna hold you till I die. Till we both break down and cry. I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.Good lovin', the girls got plenty good lovin'. Ask me how I know and I'll tell you so. She use ta be my girl. I respected her when she was mine.

I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on. Running on-running on empty. Running on-running blind. Running on-running into the sun. But I'm running behind. Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive. Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive. In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own. I don't know when that road turned into the road I'm on. Running on-running on empty. Running on-running blind. Running on-running into the sun. But I'm running behind. Everyone I know, everywhere I go. People need some reason to believe. I don't know about anyone but me. If it takes all night, that'll be all right. If I can get you to smile before I leave. Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels. I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels. I look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through. Looking into their eyes I see them running too. Running on-running on empty. Running on-running blind. Running on-running into the sun. But I'm running behind. Honey you really tempt me. You know the way you look so kind. I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind. You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find. Running into the sun but I'm running behindNeil Diamond. Miscellaneous. Desiree. . Written by: Neil Diamond. It was the third of June. On that summer's day. Well I became a man. At the hands of a girl. Almost twice my age. And she came to me. Just like a morning sun. And it wasn't so much. Her words as such. As the way they were sung. It was the way they were sung. Desiree. Oh, Desiree. There I was found. By the sweet passion sound. Of your loving song. Time was right, the night was long. Remember, Desiree. Oh, Desiree. Somehow I knew. I could only have you. 'Til the morning light. If only for that single night. Sweet Desiree, you make it right. Then came the fourth of June. On that sleepless night. Well I tossed and I turned. While the thought of her burned. Up and down my mind. For she was there and gone. Without one regret. But she continues on. Like the words of a song. I could not forget. I could not forget. Desiree. Oh, Desiree. There I was found. By the sweet passion sound. Of your loving song. Time was right, the night was long. Remember, Desiree. Oh, Desiree. And though somehow I knew. I could only have you. 'Til the morning light. The night was long, the time was right.

Please don't go away while wine is on the table. Please don't go away (Don't go!) just lay your body down.. Now I don't know what I would do if you got up to leave,. My jealous heart beats deep inside and not here on my sleeve.. 'Cause I could show a girl like you such loving and affection,. I don't want to make no speech this here ain't no election.. Please don't go away, Honey, change your mind and stay!. Hot love's on the way, Honey, let me hear you say - yeah, yeah, yeah!. One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me..

Night and day there's burnin' down inside of me. Oh, burnin' love with a yearnin' that won't let me be. Down I go and I just can't take it all alone. I really should be holdin' you, holdin' you.

The breakup we had has made me lonesome and sad. I realize I love you. 'Cause I want you bad, hey, hey. I spent the evening with the radio. Regret the moment that I let you go. Our quarrel was such a way of learning so much. I know now that I love you. 'Cause I need your touch, hey, hey. Reunited and it feels so good. Reunited 'cause we understood. There's one perfect fit. And, sugar, this one is it. We both are so excited. 'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey. I sat here staring at the same old wall. Came back to life just when I got your call. I wished I could climb right through the telephone line. And give you what you want. So you will still be mine, hey, hey. I can't go cheating, honey, I can't play. I found it very hard to stay away.

It's raining in the park but meantime. South of the river you stop and you hold everything. A band is blowing Dixie double four time. You feel alright when you hear that music ring. Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces. Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down. Competition in other places. Ah but the horns, they blowing that sound. Way on down south, way on down south, London town. You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords. Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing. Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford. When he gets up under the lights to play his thing. And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene. He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright. He can play the honky tonk like anything. Saving it up for Friday night. With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing. And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner. Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles. They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band. It ain't what they call rock and roll. Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole. Creole. And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone. And says at last, just as the time bell rings. "Goodnight, now it's time to go home". Then he makes it fast with one more thing. "We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing"Babe i'm leavin'. i must be on my way. the time is drawing near. my train is going. i see it in your eyes. the love, the need, your tears. but i'll be lonely without you. and i'll need your love to see me through. so please believe me. my heart is in your hands. and i'll be missing you.

How I hate to spend the evening on my own. Autumn winds. Blowing outside my window as I look around the room. And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom. There's not a soul out there. No one to hear my prayer. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Take me through the darkness to the break of the day. Movie stars. Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win. It's so different from the world I'm living in. Tired of TV. I open the window and I gaze into the night. But there's nothing there to see no one in sight. There's not a soul out there. No one to hear my prayer. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Take me through the darkness to the break of the day. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight.

What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?. Wrap myself up and take me home again. Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me. I figure it's the love that keeps you warm.

Because he was poor. But he refused to accept his fate. And today his honor has been restored. He was only nineteen and he was sentenced to die. For something that somebody else did and blamed on El Lute. Then they changed it to life and so he could escape. From then on they chased him and searched for him day and night. All over Spain but the search was in vain for El Lute. He had only seen the dark side of life the man they called El Lute. And he wanted a home just like you and like me. In a country where all would be free. So he taught himself to read and to write it didn't help El Lute. He was one who had dared to escape overnight they had to find El Lute. No one gave you a chance in the Spain of those days. On the walls every place they had put up the face of El Lute. And he robbed where he could just like once Robin Hood.

His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow,. Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong.. He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison;. I took care of Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son.. I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy,. "Son my life is over, but yours has just begun".. "Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done. Walk away from trouble if you can.. It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope you're old enough to understand,. Son, you don't have to fight to be a man.". There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky.. In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man.. One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling. They took turns at Becky, (and there was three of them).. Tommy opened up the door, and saw Becky crying.. The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand.. He reached above the fireplace, and took down his daddy's picture.. As the tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:. "Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done. Walk away from trouble if you can.. It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope you're old enough to understand,. Son, you don't have to fight to be a man.. The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom;. One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor.. When Tommy turned around they said, "Hey look! old yeller's leaving,". But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door.. Twenty years of crawling were bottled up inside him.. He wasn't holding nothing back -- he let 'em have it all.. When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing.. He said, "This one's for Becky, as he watched the last one fall. (And I heard him say,). "I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done. I walk away from trouble when I can. Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek,. And papa, I should hope you understand. Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man".. Everyone considered him the coward of the county.Girl, close your eyes. Let that rhythm get into you. Don't try to fight it.

And I felt a yearning for that great adventure. So many nights I woke up out of a dream. A dream of blue seas, white sands,. Paradise birds, butterflies and beautiful warm-hearted girls. Sun of Jamaica, the dreams of Malaika. Our love is my sweet memory. Sun of Jamaica, Blue Lady Malaika. Some day I'll return, wait and see. Walk in the sand and I'm happy with you. We shall be loving and true. Oh I sure love Malaika. With all of my heart. I will always be faithful and true, yeah true. But now as I grew older. This buring desire became so strong. That I bought me a ticket to fly over there. And then I found you. And we found an eternal love right from the beginning. Stars falling down from the sleepy lagoon. Palms swaying under the moon. We were swimming out into the calm, crystal sea. In that fateful night I thought to myself. I'll do everything I can, save every dime. And one day I'll return, come back home to you. And then I'll stay forever, forever. Sun of Jamaica, the dreams of Malaika. Our love is my sweet memory. Sun of Jamaica, Blue Lady Malaika. Some day I'll return, wait and see. Walk in the sand and I'm happy with you. We shall be loving and true. Oh I sure love Malaika. With all of my heart. I will always be faithful and true, yeah trueI'm lying alone with my head on the phone. Thinking of you till it hurts. I know you hurt too but what else can we do?. Tormented and torn apart. I wish I could carry your smile in my heart. For times when my life seems so low. It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring. When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know. I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you. I know you were right, believing for so long. I'm all out of love, what am I without you?. I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong. I want you to come back and carry me home. Away from these long lonely nights. I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too?. Does the feeling seem oh so right?. And what would you say if I called on you now. Saying that I can't hold on?. There's no easy way, it gets harder each day. Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone. I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you. I know you were right, believing for so long. I'm all out of love, what am I without you?. I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong. (What are you thinking of?). What are you thinking of?. (What are you thinking of?). What are you thinking of?. I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you.

Got nothin' to lose. So you just sing the blues. All the time. Gave you my heart. Gave you my soul. You left me alone here. With nothing to hold. Yesterday's gone. Now all I want is a smile. First, they say they want you. How they really need you. Suddenly you find you're out there. Walking in a storm. When they know they have you. Then they really have you. Nothing you can do or say. You've got to leave,. Just get away. We all know the song. You need what you need. You can say what you want. Not much you can do. When the feeling is gone. May be blue skies above. But it's cold. When you love's on the rocks. First, they say they want you. How they really need you. Suddenly you find you're out there. Walking in a storm. When they know they have you. Then they really have you. Nothing you can do or say. You've got to leave. Just get away. We all know the song. Love on the rocks. Ain't no big surprise. Pour me a drink. And I'll tell you my lies. Yesterday's gone.

Right through the very heart of it. New York, New York.. I want to wake up. In a city that doesn't sleep. And find I'm king of the hill. Top of the heap.... These little-town blues. Are melting away. I'll make a brand new start of it. In old New York.. If I can make it there. I'll make it anywhere. It's up to you. New York, New York.. New York, New York. I want to wake up in a city.

And resentment rides high but emotions won't grow. And we're changing our ways, taking different roads. Then love, love will tear us apart again. Love, love will tear us apart again. Why is the bedroom so cold turned away on your side?. Is my timing that flawed our respect run so dry?. Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives. But love, love will tear us apart again. Love, love will tear us apart again. Do you cry out in your sleep all my failings exposed?. And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold. Is it something so good just can't function no more?. When love, love will tear us apart again. Love, love will tear us apart again. Love, love will tear us apart again. Love, love will tear us apart againWhen I first saw him standing there. I longed to speak but did not dare. Something inside whispered to me. You'd better move in carefully. And then he smiled and turned away. That told me all he could not say. That's when I knew he wanted me too. But I had to do some breaking through. (). He's so shy(so good lookin'), he's so shy (really got me goin'). That sweet little boy who caught my eye. He's so shy (one in a million), he's so shy (really got me spinnin'). And he's much too good to let get by. Oh oh oh yes he is. Now holding him gently through the night. Nothing has ever felt so right. And I'm so glad I took the time. That I had to take to make him mine. He can still do things to my heart. Just like he did right from the start. Each time I see that quality. That never stops attracting me. (). That I'll love him 'till the day I die. () x2. He's so shyWhen the world is on your shoulder. Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down. If you can't hang with the feeling. Then there ain't no room for you, this part of town. 'Cause we're in the party. People, night and day. Livin' crazy that's the only way. So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf.

Life ain't so bad at allI realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice. And it don't count for much. But i'm not letting go. I believe there's still much to believe in. . So lift your eyes if you feel you can. Reach for a star and i'll show you a plan. I figured it out. What i needed was someone to show me. . You know you can't fool me. I've been loving you too long. It started so easy. You want to carry on. . (chorus). Lost in love and i don't know much. Was i thinking aloud and fell out of touch?. But i'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted. . So lift your eyes if you feel you can. Reach for a star and i'll show you a plan. I figured it out. What i needed was someone to show me. . You know you can't fool me. I've been loving you too long. It started so easy. You want to carry on. . (chorus). You know you can't fool me. I've been loving you too long. It started so easy. You want to carry on. . (chorus). Now i'm lost, lost in love, lost in love, lost in love. Now i'm lost, lost in love, lost in love, lost in love. Lost in love, lost in love, lost in love. Lost in love, lost in love, lost in loveOver by the window, there's a pack of cigarettes. Not my brand you understand, sometimes the girl forgets. She forgets to hide them, I know who left those smokes behind. She'll say, oh, he's just a friend and I'll say, oh, I'm not blind to. Him, him, him, what's she gonna do about him. She's gonna have to do without him. It's him or it's me, me, me. No one gets to get it for free, it's me or it's him. Don't know what he looks like, don't know who he is. Don't know why she thought that I would say what's mine is his. I don't want to own her but I can't let her have it both ways. Three is one too many of us, she leaves with me or stays with. Him, him, him, what's she gonna do about him. She's gonna have to live without him. It's him or it's me, me, me. No one gets to get it for free, it's me or it's him. If she wants him she can have him. Just exactly how we once were. It's goodbye to he and I. Back to me and her, without. Him, him, him, what's she gonna do about him. She's gonna have to do without him. Or do without me, me, me. No one gets to get it for free. Time for me to make the girl see. It's me or it's him, him, him, what's she gonna do about him. She's gonna have to do without him. Or do without me, me, me. No one gets to get it for free. Time for me to make the girl see, it's me or it's himShe's out of my life, she's out of my life. And I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I don't know whether to live or die. And it cuts like a knife, she's out of my life. It's out of my hands, it's out of my hands. To think for two years she was here. And I took her for granted I was so cavalier. Now the way that it stands, she's out of my hands. So I've learned that love's not possession. And I've learned that love won't wait. Now I've learned that love needs expression. But I've learned too late and. She's out of my life, she's out of my life. Damned indecision and cursed pride. Kept my love for her locked deep inside. And it cuts like a knife, she's out of my lifeBabooshka. Babooshka. . She wanted to test her husband. She knew exactly what to do. A pseudonym to fool him. She couldn't have made the worst move. . She sent him scented letters. And he received them. With a strange delight. Just like his wife. . But how she was before the tears. And how she was before the years flew by. And how she was when she was beautiful. She signed the letter. . All yours. Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya. All yours. Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya. . Babooshka. . She wanted to take it further. So she arranged a place to go. To see if he. Would fall for her incognito. . And when he laid eyes on her. He got the feeling they had met before. Uncanny how she. Reminds him of his little lady. . Capacity to give him all he needs. Just like his wife before she freezed on him. Just like his wife when she was beautiful. He shouted out. . I'm all yours. Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya. All yours. Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya. All yours. Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya. . Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya. Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya. Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya. . Babooshka. Babooshka. . Babooshka. Babooshka. BabooshkaLonger than there've been fishes in the ocean. Higher than any bird ever flew. Longer than there've been stars up in the Heavens. I've been in love with you. Stronger than any mountain cathedral. Truer than any tree ever grew. Deeper than any forest primeval. I am in love with you. I'll bring fires in the winters. You'll send showers in the springs. We'll fly through the falls and summers. With love on our wings. Through the years as the fire starts to mellow. Burning lines in the book of our lives. Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow. I'll be in love with you, I'll be in love with you. Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean. Higher than any bird ever flew. Longer than there've been stars up in the Heavens. I've been in love with you, I am in love with youFirst thing I remember. I was lying in my bed. Couldn't've been no more. Than one or two. I remember there's a radio. Comin' from the room next door. And my mother laughed. The way some ladies do. When it's late in the evening. And the music's seeping through. The next thing I remember. I am walking down the street. I'm feeling all right. I'm with my boys. I'm with my troops, yeah. And down along the avenue. Some guys were shootin' pool. And I heard the sound of a cappella groups, yeah. Singing late in the evening. And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah. Then I learned to play some lead guitar. I was underage in this funky bar. And I stepped outside to smoke myself a "J". And when I came back to the room. Everybody just seemed to move. And I turned my amp up loud and began to play. And it was late in the evening. And I blew that room away. First thing I remember. When you came into my life. I said, "I'm gonna get that girl. No matter what I do". Well, I guess I'd been in love before. And once or twiceI'd been on the floor. But I never loved no one. The way I loved you. And it was late in the evening. And all the music seeping throughOoh, Ooh. Yeah, Yeah.

Get on your feet now baby danceThere've been times in my life. I've been wondering why. Still somehow I believed. We'd always survive. Now I'm not so sure. You're waiting to hear. One good reason to try. But what more can I say?. What's left to provide?. You think that maybe it's over. Only if you want it to be. Are you gonna wait for your sign, your miracle?.

Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead. It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by. Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly. 'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight. The moment that he's with me, everything's alright. Night time is the right time, we make love. Then it's his and my time, we take off. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant. To go slow dancing, anything I want. Only when he's with me, I catch light. Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly. I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me). When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight. Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. (My baby takes the morning train). He's always on that morning train. (He works from nine to five and then). He works so hard. (He takes another home again). To find me waiting for him. (My baby takes the morning train). (He works from nine to five and then). (He takes another home again). (To find me waitin' for him)Once in your life you find her. Someone that turns your heart around. And next thing you know you're closing down the town. Wake up and it's still with you. Even though you left her way across town. Wondering to yourself, "Hey, what've I found?". When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do is fall in love. Arthur he does as he pleases. All of his life, he's master's choice. Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy. Living his life one day at a time. He's showing himself a really good time. He's laughing about the way they want him to be. When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do is fall in love. When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City. The best that you can do.

The best that you can do. The best that you can do is fall in loveFor your eyes only can see me through the night. For your eyes only, I never need to hide. You can see so much in me, so much in me that's new. I never felt till I looked at you. For your eyes only, only for you. You'll see what no-one else can see and now I'm breaking free. For your eyes only, only for you. The love I know you need in me, the fantasy you've freed in me. Only for you, only for you. For your eyes only, the nights are never cold. You really know me, that's all I need to know. Maybe I'm an open book because I know you're mine. But you won't need to read between the lines. For your eyes only, only for you. You see what no-one else can see and now I'm breaking free. For your eyes only, only for you. The passions that collide in me, the wild abandoned side of me. Only for you, for your eyes onlyYou should have seen by the. Look in my eyes baby. There was something missin'. You should have know by the. Tone of my voice maybe. But you didn't listen. You played dead. But you never bled. Instead you laid still in the grass. All coiled up and hissin'. You know I know. All about those men. Still I don't remember. 'Cause it was us baby. Way before them. And we're still together. And I meant every word I said. When I said that I loved you. I meant that I love you forever. And i'm gonna keep on lovin' you. Cause it's the only thing I wanna do. I don't wanna sleep. I just wanna keep on lovin' you. And I meant every word I said. When I said that I love you. I meant that I love you forever. And i'm gonna keep on lovin' you. Cause it's the only thing i wanna do. I don't wanna sleep. I just wanna keep on lovin' you. Baby, I'm gonna keep on lovin' you. Cause it's the only thing I wanna do. I don't wanna sleep. I just wanna keep on lovin' youHe said that he loved me, never would go,. oh oh, oh oh.. Now I find I'm sitting here on my own,. oh oh, oh oh.. Was it something I've said or done,. That made him pack his bags up and run?. Could it be another he's found?. It's breaking up the happy home.. Mister,. can you tell me where my love has gone?. He's a Japanese boy.. I woke up one morning and my love was gone,. Oh, my Japanese boy, ooh,. I miss my Japanese boy.. People ask about him every day,. oh oh, oh oh.. Don't know what to tell them,. what can I say?. Oh oh, oh oh.. If only he would write me or call. A word of explanation, that's all.. It would stop me climbing the wall.. It's breaking up the happy home.. Mister. can you tell me where my love has gone?. He's a Japanese boy.. I woke up one morning and my love was gone,. Oh, my Japanese boy, ooh,. I miss my Japanese boy.. Was it something I've said or done,. That made him pack his bags up and run?. Could it be another he's found?. It's breaking up the happy home..

Mister. can you tell me where my love has gone?Jessie is a friend, yeah. I know he's been a good friend of mine. But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define. Jessie's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine. And she's watching him with those eyes. And she's loving him with that body, I just know it. Yeah 'n' he's holding her in his arms late, late at night. You know. I wish that I had Jessie's girl. I wish that I had Jessie's girl. Where can I find a woman like that. I play along with the charade. There doesn't seem to be a reason to change. You know, I feel so dirty when they start talking cute. I wanna tell her that I love her,. But the point is probably moot. 'Cause she's watching him with those eyes. And she's loving him with that body, I just know it. And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night. You know. I wish that I had Jessie's girl. I wish that I had Jessie's girl. Where can I find a woman like that. Like Jessie's girl. I wish that I had Jessie's girl. Where can I find a woman. Where can I find a woman like that. And I'm looking in the mirror all the time. Wondering what she don't see in me. I've been funny, I've been cool with the lines. Ain't that the way love supposed to be. Tell me, where can I find a woman like that. You know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl. I wish that I had Jessie's girl. I want Jessie's girl. Where can I find a woman like that. Like Jessie's girl. I wish that I had Jessie's girl. I want, I want Jessie's girl'We walked in the cold air. Freezing breath on a window pane. Lying and waiting. A man in the dark in a picture frame. So mystic and soulful. A voice reaching out in a piercing cry. It stays with you until. The feeling has gone, only you and I. It means nothing to me. This means nothing to me. Oh, Vienna. The music is weaving. Haunting notes, pizzicato strings. The rhythm is calling. Alone in the night as the daylight brings. A cool, empty silence. The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky. It fades to the distance. The image has gone, only you and I. It means nothing to me. This means nothing to me. Oh, Vienna. This means nothing to me. This means nothing to me. Oh, ViennaHey, Mr. Churchill comes over here. To say we're doing splendidly. But it's very cold out here in the snow. Marching to win from the enemy. Oh, I say it's tough, I have had enough. Can you stop the Cavalry?. I have had to fight, almost every night. Down throughout these centuries. That is when I say, oh yes, yet again. Can you stop the Cavalry?. Mary Bradley waits at home. In the nuclear fall-out zone. Wish I could be dancing now. In the arms of the girl I love. Dub a dub a dum dum. Dub a dub a dum. Dub a dum dum dub a dub. Dub a dub a dum. Dub a dub a dum dum. Dub a dub a dum. Dub a dum dum dub a dub. Dub a dub a dum. Wish I was at home for Christmas. Bang, that's another bomb on another town. While Luzar and Jim have tea. If I get home, live to tell the tale. I'll run for all presidencies. If I get elected I'll stop, I will stop the Cavalry. Dub a dub a dum dum. Dub a dub a dum. Dub a dum dum dub a dub.

You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll . One day in your life. You'll remember the love you found here. You'll remember me somehow. Though you don't need me now. I will stay in your heart.

I saw the look in your eyes, lookin' into mine. Seeing what you wanted to see. . Darlin' don't say a word, 'cause I already heard. What your body's sayin' to mine. I'm tired of fast moves I've got a slow groove. On my mind. . I want a man with a slow hand. I want a lover with an easy touch. I want somebody who will spend some time. Not come and go in a heated rush. I want somebody who will understand. When it comes to love, I want a slow hand. . On shadowed ground, with no one around. And a blanket of stars in our eyes. We are drifting free, like two lost leaves. On the crazy wind of the night. . Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard. What your body's sayin' to mine.

Suddenly I'm up on top of the world. should have been somebody else.. Believe it or not, I'm walking on air.. I never thought I could feel so free.. Flying away on a wing and a prayer. Who could it be?. Believe it or not, it's just me.. Looks like the light of a new day. Hit me from out of the blue.. Breaking me out of the spell I was in. Making all of my wishes come true.. Believe it or not, I'm walking on air.. I never thought I could feel so free.. Flying away on a wing and a prayer. Who could it be?. Believe it or not, it's just me.. This is too good to be true,.

But if my spirit is lost. How will I find what is near. Don't question I'm not alone. Somehow I'll find my way home. My sun shall rise in the east. So shall my heart be at peace. And if you're asking me when. I'll say it starts at the end. You know your will to be free. Is matched with love secretly. And talk will alter your prayer. Somehow you'll find you are there.

Somehow I'll find my way home. Somehow I'll find my way homeI must have left my house at eight because I always do. My train, I'm certain left the station just when it was due. I must have read the morning paper going into town. And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned. I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine. With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed. I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so. The usual place, the usual bunch. And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained. The day before you came. I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two. And at the time I never even noticed I was blue. I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day. Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away. At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule. A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school. The train back home again. Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then. Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame. The day before you came. I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so. And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go. I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV. There's not, I think a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see. I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten. I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then. I must have read a while. The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style. It's funny but I had no sense of living without aim. The day before you came. And turning out the light I must have yawned. And curled up for yet another night. And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain. The day before you cameDolly Parton. Greatest Hits. I Will Always Love You. If i should stay. Well, i would only be in your way. And so i'll go, and yet i know.

How could I resist the aroma of your perfume.. You and I were inseparable. it was love at first sight.. You made me promise to marry you. I made you promise to be my wife. But then you were only eight years old and I had just about turned nine.. I thought that life was always good. I thought you always would be mine.. It started with a kiss. never thought it would come to this.. It started with a kiss. never thought it would come to this.. I remember ev'ry little thing like fighting in the playground. As some good looking boy had started to hang around.. That boy hurt me so bad. but I was happy 'cause you cried. - still -. I couldn't help but notice that new distant look in your eyes. And then when you were sixteen. and I had just turned seventeen. I couldn't hold on to your love. I couldn't hold on to my dreams.. It started with a kiss. never thought is would come to this.. It started with a kiss. never thought it would come to this.. You don't remember me. do you? You don't remember me. do you?. Walking down the street came the star of my love story. And my heart began to beat so fast. so clear was my memory.. I heard my voice cry out her name. and as she looked and looked away. I felt so hurt. I felt so small. and it was all that I could say. You don't remember me. do you? You don't remember me. do you?. You don't remember me. do you? You don't remember me. do you?. It started with a kiss. never thought it would come to this.. It started with a kiss. never thought it would come to this.Golden brown texture like sun. Lays me down with my mind she runs. Throughout the night. No need to fight. Never a frown with golden brown. Every time just like the last. On her ship tied to the mast. To distant lands. Takes both my hands. Never a frown with golden brown. Golden brown finer temptress. Through the ages she's heading west. From far away. Stays for a day. Never a frown with golden brown. Never a frown with golden brown. Never a frown with golden brown. Never a frown with golden brown. Never a frown with golden brownSometimes I wonder where I've been. Who I am, do I fit in. Make belivin' is hard alone,. Out here on my own. We're always provin' who we are. Always reachin' for that risin' star. To guide me far and shine me home,. Out here on my own.. When I'm down and feelin' blue. I close my eyes so I can be with you. Oh baby, be strong for me,. Baby, belong to me. Help me through, help me need you.. Until the morning sun appears. Making light of all my fears. I dry the tears I've never shown,. Out here on my own.. When I'm down and feelin' blue. I close my eyes so I can be with you. Oh baby, be strong for me,. Baby, belong to me. Help me through, help me need you.. Sometimes I wonder where I've been. Who I am, do I fit in.. I may not win but I can be strong,. Out here on my own, on my own.. ***Featuring DON COSTA on the guitarAl Bano:. Felicità. è tenersi per mano, andare lontano, la felicità..

Deep inside your mind. All alone, I have cried. Silent tears full of pride. In a world made of steel. Made of stone. Well, I hear the music. Close my eyes, feel the rhythm. Wrap around, take a hold of my heart. What a feeling. Being's believing. I can have it all. Now I'm dancing for my life. Take your passion. And make it happen. Pictures come alive. You can dance right through your life. Now I hear the music. Close my eyes, I am rhythm. In a flash, it takes hold of my heart. What a feeling, being's believing. I can have it all. Now I'm dancing for my life. Take your passion. And make it happen. Pictures come alive. Now I'm dancing through my life. What a feeling. What a feeling (I am music now). Being's believing (I am rhythm now). Pictures come alive. You can dance right through your life. What a feeling (I can really have it all). Being's believing. (Pictures come alive when I call). I can have it all (I can really have it all). Have it all (pictures come alive when I call). (Call, call, call, call, what a feeling). I can have it all (being's believing). Being's believing (take your passion)She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene. I said dont mind, but what do you mean I am the one. Who will dance on the floor in the round. She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round. 2nd verse. She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene. Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one. Who will dance on the floor in the round. People always told me be careful of what you do. And dont go around breaking young girls' hearts. And mother always told me be careful of who you love. And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth. Billie Jean is not my lover. She's just a girl who claims that I am the one. But the kid is not my son. She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son. For forty days and forty nights. Law was on her side. But who can stand when she's in demand. Her schemes and plans. Go dance on the floor in the round. So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice. (do think twice). She told my baby, we'll dance till 3: 00. And she looked at me. Then showed a photo of a baby cries. his eyes were like mine (oh, no!). People always told me be careful of what you do. And dont go around breaking young girls hearts. She came and stood right by me. Just the smell of her sweet perfume. This happened much too soon. She called me to her room. Billie Jean is not my lover. She's just a girl who claims that I am the one. But the kid is not my son. Billie Jean is not my lover. She's just a girl who claims that I am the one.

Set them free at the break of dawn. 'Til one by one, they were gone. Back at base, bugs in the software. Flash the message. "Something's out there". Floating in the summer sky. 99 red balloons go by. 99 red balloons. Floating in the summer sky. Panic bells, it's red alert. There's something here. From somewhere else. The war machine springs to life. Opens up one eager eye. Focusing it on the sky. Where 99 red balloons go by. 99 Decision Street. 99 ministers meet. To worry, worry, super-scurry. Call the troops out in a hurry. This is what we've waited for. This is it boys, this is war. The president is on the line. As 99 red balloons go by. 99 Knights of the airway. Ride super-high-tech jet fighters. Everyone's a Silverhero. Everyone's a Captain Kirk. With orders to identify. To clarify and classify. Scramble in the summer sky. As 99 red balloons go by. As 99 red balloons go by. 99 dreams I have had. In every one a red balloon. It's all over and I'm standin' pretty. In this dust that was a city. If I could find a souvenier. Just to prove the world was here. And here is a red balloon. I think of you and let it go.Uptown girl . She's been living in her uptown world . I bet she's never had a backstreet guy .

Always in time, but never in line for dreams. Head over heels when toe to toe. This is the sound of my soul. This is the sound. I bought a ticket to the world. But now I've come back again. Why do I find it hard to write the next line?. Oh, I want the truth to be said. I know this much is true. I know this much is true. With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue. Dissolve the nerves that have just begun. Listening to Marvin all night long. This is the sound of my soul. This is the sound. Always slipping from my hands. Sand's a time of it's own. Take your seaside arms and write the next line. Oh, I want the truth to be known. I know this much is true. I know this much is true. I bought a ticket to the world. But now I've come back again.

And they've never heard of love. I get a feeling when I look at you. Wherever you go now, I wanna be there too. They say we're crazy but I just don't care. And if they keep on talking, still they get nowhere. So I don't mind if they don't understand. When I look at you and you hold my hand. 'Cause they don't know about us. And they've never heard of love. (Do do-do-do). Why should it matter to us if they don't approve. (Do do-do-do). We should just take our chances while we've got nothin' to lose. Baby. There's no need for living in the past. Now I've found a love, I'm gonna make it last. I tell the others, don't bother me. 'Cause when they look at you they don't see what I see. No I don't listen to their wasted lines. Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs. 'Cause they don't know about us. And they've never heard of love. No I don't listen to their wasted lines. Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs. 'Cause they don't know about us. And they've never heard of loveI know just how to whisper. And I know just how to cry. I know just to where to find the answers. And I know just how to lie. I know just how to fake it. And I know just how to scheme. I know just to when to face the truth. And then I know just to when to dream. And I know just to where to touch you. And I know just to what to prove. I know when to pull you closer. And I know when to let you lose. And I know the night is fading. And I know that time's gonna fly. And I'm never gonna tell you everything, I've got to tell you. But I know I've got to give it a try. And I know the roads to riches. And I know the ways to fame. I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em. And I always know the name of the game. But I don't know how to leave you. And I'll never let you fall. And I don't know how you do it. Making love out of nothing at all. (Making love). Out of nothing at all. (Making love). Out of nothing at all. (Making love). Out of nothing at all. (Making love). Out of nothing at all. (Making love). Out of nothing at all. (Making lot of love). Out of nothing at all. Every time I see you all the rays of the sun. Are streaming through the waves in your hair. And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes. Like a spotlight. The beating of my heart is a drum, and it's lost. And it's looking for a rhythm like you. You can take the darkness from the pit of the night. And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright, I've got to follow it. 'Cause everything I know. Well, it's nothing till I give it to you, alright. I can make the runner stumble. I can make the final block. And I can make every tackle, at the sound of the whistle. I can make all the stadiums rock. And I can make tonight forever. Or I can make it disappear by the dawn. And I can make you every promise that has ever been made. I can make all your demons be gone. But I'm never gonna make it without you. Do you really want to see me crawl?. And I'm never gonna make it like you do. Making love out of nothing at all. (Making love). Out of nothing at all.

Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. I should have known better than to cheat a friend. And waste a chance that I'd been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Time can never mend. The careless whispers of a good friend. To the heart and mind ignorance is kind. There's no comfort in the truth, pain is that all you'll find. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. I should have known better than to cheat a friend. And waste a chance that I'd been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. With or without your love. Tonight the music seems so loud. I wish that we could lose this crowd. Maybe it's better this way. We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say. We could have been so good together. We could have lived this dance forever. But now, who's gonna dance with me?. Please stay. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. I should have known better than to cheat a friend. And waste a chance that I'd been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. (Now that you're gone). Now that you're gone. (Now that you're gone). Was what I did so wrong?. So wrong that you had to leave me alone?I come home in the mornin' light. My Mother says,"When you gonna live your life right?". Oh Mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones. And girls, they wanna have fun. Oh girls just wanna have fun. The phone rings in the middle of the night. My Father yells,"What you gonna do with your life?". Oh Daddy dear, you know you're still number one. But girls, they wanna have fun. Oh girls just wanna have. That's all they really want. Some fun. When the workin' day is done. Girls they wanna have fun. Oh girls just wanna have fun.   (Girls, they want). (Wanna have fun). (Girls wanna have). Some boys take a beautiful girl. And hide her away from the rest of the world.

Oh whats love got to do with it. What's love but a second hand emotion. What's love got to do with it. Who needs a heart. When a heart can be broken. I've been taking on a new direction. But I have to say. I've been thinking about my own protection. It scares me to feel this way. What's love got to do, got do with it. What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion. What's love got to do, got to do with it. Who needs a heart when a heart can be brokenIt's Christmas time. There's no need to be afraid. At Christmas time. We let in light and we banish shade. . And in our world of plenty. We can spread a smile of joy. Throw your arms around the world. At Christmas time. . But say a prayer. Pray for the other ones. At Christmas time, it's hard. But when you're having fun. . There's a world outside your window. And it's a world of dreaded fear. Where the only water flowing. Is a bitter sting of tears. .

Crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress. Without a patch for the party to go. But you know she'll get by. 'Cause she's living in the love of the common people. Smile's from the heart of a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can. It's a good thing you don't have a bus fare. It would fall through the hole in your pocket and you'd lose it. In the snow on the ground. You got to walk into town to find a job. Tryin' to keep your hands warm. When the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through. And chills you to the bone. Now you'd better go home where it's warm. Where you can live in a love of the common people. Smile from the heart of a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can. Living on a dream ain't easy. But the closer the knit, the tighter the fit. And the chills stay away. Keeping 'em in stride for family pride. You know that faith is in your foundation. And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation. But don't forget to pray. 'Cause making it strong were you belong. And we're living in the love of the common people. Smile's from the heart of a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can. Yes, we're living in the love of the common people. Smile's from the heart of a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can. Living in the love of the common people. Smile's from the heart of a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can. Living in the love of the common people. Smile's really hard on a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she canTo all the girls I've loved before. Who traveled in and out my door. I'm glad they came along. I dedicate this song to all the girls I've loved before. To all the girls I've once caressed. And may I say I've held the best. For helping me to grow. I owe a lot I know to all the girls I've loved before. The winds of change are always blowing. And every time I tried to stay. The winds of change continue blowing. And they just carried me away. To all the girls who shared my life. Who now are someone else's wives. I'm glad they came along. I dedicate this song to all the girls I've loved before. To all the girls who cared for me. Who filled my nights with ecstasy. They live within my heart. I'll always be a part of all the girls I've loved before. The winds of change are always blowing.

Had a band and we tried real hard. Jimmy quit, Jody got married. I should've known we'd never get far. Oh, when I look back now. That summer seemed to last forever. And if I had the choice. Yeah, I'd always wanna be there. Those were the best days of my life. Ain't no use in complaining. When you've got a job to do. Spent my evenings down at the drive-in. And that's when I met you, yeah. Standing on your mama's porch. You told me that you'd wait forever. Oh, and when you held my hand. I knew that it was now or never. Those were the best days of my life. Oh, yeah. Back in the summer of '69, oh. Man, we were killing time. We were young and restless. We needed to unwind. I guess nothing can last forever. Forever, no. Yeah. And now the times are changing. Look at everything that's come and gone. Sometimes when I play that old six-string. I think about you, wonder what went wrong.

You look at the faces, its just like a dream. Nobody know where you're going. Nobody cares where you've been. 'Cause you belong to the city. You belong to the night. living in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light. You were born in the city. Concrete under your feet. It's in your blood, its in your moves. You're a man of the street. When you said goodbye. You were on the run. Tryin' to get away from the things you'd done. Now you're back again. And you're feeling strange. So much has happened, but nothing has changed. You still don't know where you're going. Your still just a face in the crowd. 'Cause you belong to the city. You can feel it. You can taste it. You can see it. You can face it. You can hear it. You're getting near it. You want to make it. 'Cause you can take it.. You belong to the cityIf I was, if I was a better man. Would fellow men take me to their hearts. If I was a stronger man. Carrying the weight of popular demand. Tell me would that alarm her?. I'd never harm her at all. If I was a soldier. Captive arms I'd lay before her. If I was a sailor. Seven oceans I'd sail to her. If I was a wiser man. Would other men reach out. And touch me. If I was a kinder man. Dishing up love for a hungry world. Tell me would that appease her. I want to please her again. If I was a painter. I'd paint a world that couldn't taint her. If I was a leader. On food of love from above. I would feed her. If I was a poet. All my love in burning words. I would show it. If I was her lover. Her eyes in kisses I would cover. Come here, my baby. Oh, they can't touch you now. I'll keep you safe and warm. I'll never leave you at all. Come here my, baby. Oh, they won't touch you. Dishing up love for a hungry world. Tell me would that appease you. I want to please you again. If I was a soldier. Captive arms I'd lay before her. If I was a sailor. Seven oceans I'd sail to her. If I was a painter. I'd paint a world that couldn't taint her. If I was a leader. On food of love from above. I would feed her. If I was a poet.

Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well. I was not ready for the fall. Too blind to see the writing on the wall. . A man can tell a thousand lies. I've learned my lesson well. Hope I live to tell. The secret I have learned, 'till then. It will burn inside of me. . I know where beauty lives. I've seen it once, I know the warmth she gives. The light that you could never see. It shines inside, you can't take that from me. . A man can tell a thousand lies. I've learned my lesson well. Hope I live to tell. The secret I have learned, 'till then. It will burn inside of me. . The truth is never far behind. You kept it hidden well. If I live to tell. The secret I knew then. Will I ever have the chance again?. . If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far. How would they hear the beating of my heart. Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?. How will they hear, when will they learn, how will they know?. . A man can tell a thousand lies. I've learned my lesson well. Hope I live to tell. The secret I have learned, 'till then. It will burn inside of me. . The truth is never far behind. You kept it hidden well. If I live to tell. The secret I knew then.

It will burn inside of me(Verse One). Goddess on the mountain top. Burning like a silver flame. The summit of beauty and love. And Venus was her name. . (Chorus). She's got it . Yeah, baby, she's got it. I'm your Venus, I'm your fire. At your desire. Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire. At your desire. . (Verse Two). Her weapons were her crystal eyes. Making every man a man. Black as the dark night she was. Got what no-one else had. Wa!. . (Chorus). . (Verse One). . (Chorus)I believe that children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside. Give them a sense of pride to make it easier. Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be. . Everybody searching for a hero. People need someone to look up to. I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs. A lonely place to be and so I learned to depend on me. . I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows. If I fail, if I succeed at least I live as I believe. No matter what they take from me. They can't take away my dignity. . Because the greatest love of all is happening to me. I found the greatest love of all inside of me. The greatest love of all is easy to achieve. Learning to love yourself it is the greatest love of all. . I believe that children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside.

That you've been dreaming of. Leads you to a lonely place. Find your strength in loveSix o'clock already. I was just in the middle of a dream. I was kissin' Valentino. By a crystal blue Italian stream. But I can't be late. 'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid. These are the days. When you wish your bed was already made. It's just another manic Monday. I wish it was Sunday. 'Cause that's my funday. My I don't have to runday. It's just another manic Monday. Have to catch an early train. Got to be to work by nine. And if I had an airoplane.

Turn a different corner and we never would have met. Would you care?. I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze. Little by little, you've brought me to my knees. Don't you care?. No, I've never come close in all of these years. You are the only one to stop my tears. I'm so scared of this love. And if all that there is, is this fear of being used.

To take life on earth. To the second birth. And the man was in command. It was a flight on the wings. Of a young girl's dreams. That flew too far away. Don't push too far. Your dreams are china in your hand. Don't wish too hard. Because they may come true. And you can't help them. You don't know what you might. Have set upon yourself. China in your hand.

The nights we almost lost it once again. We can take the night into tomorrow. Living on feelings. Touching you I feel it all again. Didn't we almost have it all. When love was all we had worth giving. The ride with you was worth the fall my friend. Loving you makes life worth living. Didn't we almost have it all. The nights we held on till the morning. You know you'll never love that way again. Didn't we almost have it all. The way you used to touch me felt so fine. We kept our hearts together down the line. A moment in the soul can last forever. Comfort and keep us. Help me bring the feeling back again. Didn't we almost have it all. When love was all we had worth giving. The ride with you was worth the fall my friend. Loving you makes life worth living. Didn't we almost have it all. The nights we held on till the morning. You know you'll never love that way again. Didn't we almost have it all. Didn't we have the best of times. When love was young and new. Couldn't we reach inside and find. The world of me and you. We'll never lose it again. Cause once you know what love is. You'll never let it end. Didn't we almost have it all. When love was all we had worth giving. The ride with you was worth the fall my friend. Loving you makes life worth living. Didn't we almost have it all. The nights we held on till the morning. You know you'll never love that way again. Didn't we almost have it all. Didn't we almost have it allMore than an ocean, keeps us apart. I feel a tearing in half of my heart. A walk on the water, is all that I need. But miracles are not happening. You're not even listening to me. Leaving you ain't easy now. But loving you's the harder part. You never want me for myself. And I've needed you right from the very start. Oh, won't you stay and try to. Give a little bit of heart and soul. Give a little bit of love to grow. Give a little bit of heart and soul. And don't you make me beg for love. Give a sign 'cos' I need to know. Give a little bit of heart and soul. Now listen to me I wish that I was wrong. But you don't feel that way. We drift apart with each passing day. You never seem to notice any more. Living in a fantasy, there's never any room to breath. Hoping every waking hour. You'll turn around and say that we can stay. Won't you even try to. Give a little bit of heart and soul. Give a little bit of love to grow. Give a little bit of heart and soul. And don't you make me beg for love. Give a sign 'cos' I need to know. Give a little bit of heart and soul. Somehow I lost my way. Looking to see something in your eyes. But lover will never compromise. There is the politics of life. Give a little bit of heart and soul. Give a little bit of love to grow. Give a little bit of heart and soul,. And don't you make me beg for love. Give a sign 'cos' I need to know. Give a little bit of heart and soulAu dessus des vieux volcans. Glisse des ailes sous les tapis du vent. Voyage, voyage, eternellement. De nuages en marÃ©cages.

And you just don't love me no more. What did you think. I would say At This Moment. When I'm faced with the knowledge. That you just don't love me. Did you think I would curse you. Or say things to hurt you. Cause you just don't love me no more. Did you think I could hate you. Or raise my hands to you. Now, come on, you know me too well. How could I hurt you. When Darlin' I love you. And you know, I'd never, never hurt you. What do you think. I would give At This Moment. If you'd stay, I'd subtract. Twenty years from my life. I'd fall down on my knees. Kiss the ground that you walk on. If I could just hold you againI'll bring my love to you. I'll bring my love to you. I've been stood up and messed around and taken for a fool. But next time around I'm gonna change the rules. And I don't care about the things that people say. It's you I think about each and every day. It's much too late for you to change your ways.

I lit a cigarette, picked up a monkey, start to go. The sun was spitting fire, the sky was blue as ice. I felt a little tired, so I watched 'Miami Vice'. .

Elvis landed in a rocket, rocket, rocket ship. Healed a couple of leapers and disappeared. But where was his beard. . A shadow from the sky, much too big to be a bird. A screaming, crashing noise louder than I've ever heard. It looked like two big silver trees that somehow learned to soar. Suddenly a summer breeze and a mighty lion's roar. .

While our moment was passing us by?. Oh I am here. Waiting for your change of heart. It just takes a beat to turn it around. Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart. At the edge of my seat, please turn it around. Days go by leaving me with a hunger. I could fly back to when we were younger. When adventures like cars we would ride. And the years lied ahead still untried. While I stand here. Waiting for your change of heart. It just takes a beat to turn it around. Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart. At the edge of my seat, please turn it around. Blind leading blind, never feel the laughter. Search through time, nothing reveals the answer. If it's truth that you're looking to find. It is nowhere outside of your mind. I bide my time. Waiting for your change of heart. It just takes a beat to turn it around. Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart. At the edge of my seat, please turn it around. Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart. It just takes a beat to turn it around. Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart. At the edge of my seat, please turn it around. And I'm waiting for your change of heart. Waiting for your change of heartO eh, o eh, o eh, oo aah. O eh, o eh, o eh, oo aah. Yah yeh goh.

It's coming around again. So don't mind if I fall apart. There's more room in a broken heart. You pay the grocer. You fix the toaster. You kiss the host goodbye. Then you break a window. Burn the soufflÃ©. Scream a lullaby. I know nothing stays the same. But if you're willing to play the game. It's coming around again. So don't mind if I fall apart. There's more room in a broken heart. And I believe in love. But what else can I do?. I'm so in love with you. I know nothing stays the same. But if you're willing to play the game. It will be coming around again.  (Love). Baby sneezes. (I believe in love). Mommy pleases. (I believe in love). Daddy breezes in. (I believe in love).  (Love). I know nothing stays the same.

And since the day you came. You tried to take control of me. Then came the day. I thought about running away. And now my bags are packed. Don't even think of holding me back. Nothing's gonna stop me now. And I don't wanna talk it over. I said nothing's gonna stop me now. Gonna break it up, gonna take my love away. Yeah, yeah. Day after day. I started slippin' away.

Something on my finger. Shines so brightly. Don't you know. Diamonds are a girl's best friend. When you go. They stay with me until the end. Don't you know. Diamonds are a girl's best, best friend. When you go. They stay with me until the end. Don't want your money. Don't want your key. Diamonds, love don't come for free. Don't want your money. Don't want your key. Diamonds, love don't come for free. They say you need some roses. But roses do die. You gave me some candy. It melted, nice try. I'm not that demanding. I have simple taste. I just want a token. That can't go to waste. Diamonds. Don't want your money. Don't want your key. Don't you know. Diamonds are a girl's best friend. Don't want your money. Don't want your key. Don't want your money. Don't want your key. Diamonds, love don't come for freeDebonair lullabies in melodies revealed. In deep despair on lonely nights. He knows just how you feel. The slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits. In miracles made real. . Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night. You know you're right just to hold her tight. He soothes it right, makes it out of site. And every thing's good in the world tonight. . When Smokey sings I hear violins. When Smokey sings I forget everything. As she's packing her things. As she's spreading her wings. The front door might slam. But the back door it rings. And Smokey sings, he sings. . Elegance in eloquence for sale or rent or hire. Should I say, yes, I match his best?. Then I would be a liar. Symphonies that soothe the rage. When lovers hearts catch fire. . Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night. You know you're right just to hold her tight. He soothes it right, makes it out of site. And every thing's good in the world tonight. . When Smokey sings I hear violins.

But if we gotta say. Luther croons. Sly's the original originator. James screams. Marvin was the only innovator. But nothing can compare. Nothing can compare. When Smokey sings. . When Smokey sings I hear violins. When Smokey sings I forget everything. As she's packing her things. As she's spreading her wings. She threw back the ring. When Smokey sings. Smokey sings, smokey singsWho needs friends who never show?. I'll tell you what you want to know. I could have saved a broken heart. If I'd found out long ago. .

They say you got a broken heart. I heard a rumour. . Now it seems they're telling me. You've changed your wicked ways. But should I give you a second chance. Baby, I'm too afraid. . So you realize what hurt you made. And the love you threw away. How can I forgive or soon forget?. It's never gonna be the same. . I heard a rumour. They say you got a broken heart.

I think it's time that you let me know. So if you love me, say you love me. But if you don't just let me go. 'Cause teacher, there are things that I don't want to learn. And the last one I had made me cry. So I don't want to learn to hold you. Touch you, think that you're mine. Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy. Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. When you were just a stranger and I was at your feet. I didn't feel the danger, now I feel the heat. That look in your eyes, telling me no. So you think that you love me, know that you need me. I wrote the song, I know it's wrong, just let me go. And teacher, there are things that I don't want to learn. Oh the last one I had made me cry. So I don't want to learn to hold you. Touch you, think that you're mine. Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy. Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. So when you say that you need me. That you'll never leave me. I know you're wrong, you're not that strong. Let me go. And teacher, there are things that I still have to learn. But the one thing I have is my pride. Oh so I don't want to hold you. Touch you, think that you're mine. Because there ain't no joy for an uptown boy. Who just isn't willing to try. I'm so cold.

With your positive emotions, laughs make you jump. You don't need to fuss, girl or boy. These feelings I get, I often wonder why. So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I. Now what you wear, I don't care, and if you fussed before. The reason that I like you, girl, for what you are. If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world. So try to understand.

It seems like years. Time keeps dragging on and on. And forever's been and gone. Still I can't figure what went wrong. I'd still do anything for you. I'll play your game. You hurt me through and through. But you can have your way. I can pretend each time I see you. That I don't care and I don't need you. And though you'll never see me crying. You know inside I feel like dying. And I'd do anything for you. In spite of it all. I've learned so much from you. You made me strong. But don't you ever think that I don't love you. That for one minute I forgot you. But sometimes things don't work out right. And you just have to say goodbye. I hope you find someone to please you. Someone who'll care and never leave you. But if that someone ever hurts you. You just might need a friend to turn to. And I'd do anything for you. I'll give you up. If that's what I should do. To make you happy. I can pretend each time I see you. That I don't care and I don't need you. And though inside I feel like dying. You know you'll never see me crying. Don't you ever think that I don't love you. That for one minute I forgot you. But sometimes things don't work out right. And you just have to say goodbyeThere was a time when. Broken hearts and broken dreams were over. There was a place where. All you could do was wish on a four leaf clover. . But now is a new time. There is a new place. Where dreams just can't come true. It started the day when I left you. . I could never love again the way I loved you. I could never cry again like I did when I left you. And when we said goodbye. Oh, the look in your eyes. Just left me beside myself without your heart. (Without your heart). I could never love again now that we're apart. . When I was sorry. It was too late to turn around and tell you so.   (Turn around). There was no reason, there was no reason. Just a foolish beat of my heart. . I could never love again the way I loved you. I could never cry again like I did when I left you. And when we said goodbye. Oh, the look in your eyes. Just left me beside myself without your heart. (Without your heart). I could never love again now that we're apart. . Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody. Don't you see the tears are falling down my face, since you went away. Break my heart, you slipped away. Didn't know I was wrong never meant to hurt you now you're gone. . I could never love again now that we're apart. (Now that we're apart). I could never love again now that we're apartWhy can't you do it?. Why can't you set your monkey free?. Always giving into it. Do you love your monkey or do you love me?. Why can't you do it?. Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?. Monkey with a monkey monkey. La la la. Oh, I count to ten. But I don't know how. And I don't know when. To open my eyes. Baby if you kiss me again. Like you did just now. Like you did just then. Do it again. I've had the rest. Now it's time I had the best. So you tell me. That you won't do anymore. Well I'd write your heart a letter. But I think you know me better. If I keep on asking baby, maybe. I'll get what I'm asking for. Why can't you do it?. Why can't you set your monkey free?. Always giving in to it. Do you love your monkey or do you love me?. Why can't you do it?. Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?. Monkey, with a monkey, monkey. La la la. Oh, I hate your friends. But I don't know how and I don't know when. To open your eyes. Yes, the monkey's back again. Do you want him now like you did back then?. I tried my best but your head is such a mess. So I guess that I don't want you anymore. Well you say you care about me. That you just can't do without me. But you keep on dancin' baby. 'Til that monkey has you on the floor. Why can't you do it?. Why can't you set your monkey free?. Always giving into it. Do you love the monkey or do you love me?. Why can't you do it. Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?. Monkey, with a monkey, monkey. La la la. Don't look now. There's a monkey on your back. Don't look now. There's a monkey on you. Don't look now. There's a monkey on your back. Don't look now. There's a monkey on you. So you tell me. That you won't do anymore. If I keep on askin' baby, maybe. I'll get what I'm askin' for. Why can't you do it?. Why can't you set your monkey free?. Always giving into it. Do you love the monkey or do you love me?. Why can't you do it?. Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?. Monkey, with a monkey, monkey. La la la. Why can't you do it?.

Monkey, with a monkey, monkey. La la laYou are far, when I could have been your star. You listened to people, who scares you to death. And from my heart. Strange that you were strong enough to even make a start. But you'll never find peace of mind, till you listen to your heart. People, you can never change the way they feel. Better let them do just what they will, for they will. If you let them steal your heart from you. People, will always make a lover feel a fool. But you knew I loved you. We could have shown them all. We should have seen love through. Fooled me with the tears in your eyes. Covered me with kisses and lies. So goodbye. But please don't take my heart. You are far, I'm never gonna be your star. I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart. Maybe I'll be strong enough, I don't know where to start. But I'll never find peace of mind while I listen to my heart. People, you can never change the way they feel. Better let them do just what they will, for they will. If you let them steal off your heart. And people, will always make a lover feel a fool. But you knew I loved you. We could have shown them all. But remember this, every other kiss that you'll ever give. Long as we both live. When you need the hand of another man. One you really can surrender with. I will wait for you, like I always do. But something there that can't compare with any other. You are far, when I could have been your star. You listened to people, who scared you to death. And from my heart. Strange that I was wrong enough to think you'd love me too. I guess you were kissing a fool. You must have been kissing a foolAll that I have is all that you've given me. Did you ever worry that I'd come to depend on you. I gave you all the love I had in me. Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true. Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street. And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on. You talk of love but you don't know how it feels. When you realise that you're not the only one. Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart. You'd better stop before you go and break my heart. Ooh you'd better stop. Time after time I've tried to walk away. But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two. So I just resign myself to it every day. Now all I can do is to leave it up to you. Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart. You'd better stop before you go and break my heart. Ooh you'd better stop. Stop if love me. (you will remember). Now's the time to be sorry. (that day forever). I won't believe that you'd walk out on me. Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart. You'd better stop before you go and break my heart. Ooh you'd better stopI try to discover. A little something to make me sweeter. Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart. . I'm so in love with you. I'll be forever blue. That you give me no reason. Why you're making me work so hard?. . That you give me no. That you give me no. That you give me no. That you give me no. . Soul. I hear you calling. Oh baby please. Give a little respect to me. . And if I should falter. Would you open your arms out to me?. We can make love not war. And live in peace with our hearts. . I'm so in love with you. I'll be forever blue. What religion or reason. Could drive a man to forsake his lover?. . Don't you tell me no. Don't you tell me no. Don't you tell me no. Don't you tell me no. . Soul. I hear you calling. Oh baby please. Give a little respect to me. . I'm so in love with you. I'll be forever blue.

You see I haven't been the same. Since that cold November day. We said we needed space. But all we found was an empty place. And the only things I've learned. Is that I need you desperately. So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?. Where do broken hearts go?. Can they find their way home?. Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there. And if somebody loves you. Won't they always love you?. I look in your eyes. And I know that you still care for me. Ooh.... I've been around enough to know. That dreams don't turn to gold. And that there is no easy way. No, you just can't run away. And what we had was so much more. Than we ever had before. And no matter how I try. You're always on my mind. So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?.

And I know that you still care for me. For me.... You still care. For meNAI hear your name whispered on the wind. It's a sound that makes me cry. I hear a song blow again and again. Through my mind and I don't know why. I wish I didn't feel so strong about you. Like happiness and love revolve around you. Trying to catch your heart. Is like trying to catch a star. So many people love you baby. That must be what you are. Waiting for a star to fall. And carry your heart into my arms. That's where you belong. In my arms baby, yeah. Waiting for a star to fall. And carry your heart into my arms. That's where you belong. In my arms baby, yeah. I've learn to feel what I cannot see. But with you, I lose that vision. I don't know how to dream your dream.

'Cause I got something to say about it. And it goes something like this. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test. You know, you know, you've got to. Make him express how he feels. And maybe then you'll know your love is real. You don't need diamond rings. Or eighteen karat gold. Fancy cars that go very fast. You know they never last, no, no. What you need is a big strong hand. To lift you to your higher ground. Make you feel like a queen on a throne. Make him love you till you can't come down. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test. You know, you know, you've got to. Make him express how he feels. And maybe then you'll know your love is real. Long stem roses are the way to your heart. But he needs to start with your head. Satin sheets are very romantic. What happens when you're not in bed. You deserve the best in life. So if the time isn't right then move on. Second best is never enough. You'll do much better baby on your own. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test. You know, you know, you've got to. Make him express how he feels.

Oh, baby ready or not. And when you're gone he might regret it. Think about the love he once had. Try to carry on but he just won't get it. He'll be back on his knees. To express himself. You've got to make him. Express himself. Hey, hey. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test. You know, you know, you've got to. Make him express how he feels. And maybe then you'll know your love is real. Express yourself. You've got to make him. Express himself. Hey, hey, hey, hey. So if you want it right now. Make him show you how. Express what he's got. Baby ready or not. Express yourself. Respect yourself. Hey, hey. (So if you want it right now). (Then make him show you how). Express what he's got. Oh, baby ready or not.

Your little piece of heaven, turns too dark. Listen to your heart, when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah. They're swept away, nothing is what it seems. The feeling of belonging to your dreams.... Listen to your heart, when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why. But listen to your heart, before you tell him goodbye.... And there are voices that want to be heard. So much to mention but you can't find the words. The scent of magic, the beauty that's been (beauty that's been). When love was wilder than the wind. Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why. But listen to your heart, before. Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why. But listen to your heart, before. You tell him goodbye...Shot!....

The one good thing didn't stay too long. My back was turned and she was gone. Good thing where have you gone?. My good thing you've been gone too long. People say I should forget. There's plenty more don't get upset. People say she's doin' fine. Mutual friends I see sometime. That's not what I want to hear. I want to hear she wants me near. Good thing where have you gone?. My good thing you've been gone too long?. Then one day she came back. I was so happy that I didn't ask. Morning came into my room. Caught me dreaming like a fool. Good thing, good thing. My, my, my, my good thing where have you gone?. My good thing, my good thing, girl where have you gone?. It's been so long. [Incomprehensible]Debbie Gibson. Electric Youth. Lost In Your Eyes.

Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead. Looking for the victim shivering in bed. Searching out fear in the gathering gloom. And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room. And there is nothing I can do, when I realize with fright. That the spider man is having me for dinner tonight. Quietly he laughs and shaking his head. Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed. And softer than shadow and quicker than flies. His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes. "Be still, be calm, be quiet now my precious boy. Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more. For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light. The spider man is having you for dinner tonight". And I feel like I'm being eaten. By a thousand million shivering furry holes. And I know that in the morning. I will wake up in the shivering cold. And the spider man is always hungry. Come into my parlor, said the spider to the fly. I have somethingThough we've gotta say goodbye for the summer. Darling, I promise you this.

Look around now, these are the days. Of the beggars and the choosers. This is the year of the hungry man. Whose place is in the past. Hand in hand with ignorance. And legitimate excuses. The rich declare themselves poor. And most of us are not sure. If we have too much but we'll take our chances. 'Cause God's stopped keeping score. I guess somewhere along the way. He must have let us all out to play. Turned his back and all God's children. Crept out the back door. And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate. Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of. And the wounded skies above say it's much too much too late. Well maybe we should all be praying for time, oh yeah. These are the days of the empty hand. Oh you hold on to what you can. And charity is a coat. You wear twice a year. This is the year of the guilty man. Your television takes a stand. And you find that what was over there. Is over here. So you scream from behind your door. Say what's mine is mine and not yours. I may have too much but I'll take my chances. 'Cause God's stopped keeping score. And you cling to the things they sold you. Didn't you cover your eyes when they told you?. That he can't come back. 'Cause he has no children to come back for. It's hard to love, there's so much to hate. Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of. And the wounded skies above say it's much too late. So maybe we should all be praying for time, oh yeahI could hardly believe it, when I heard the news today. I had to come and get it straight from you. They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away. From the look upon your face I see it's true. So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'. Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go. Tell me how am I supposed to live without you. Now that I've been lovin' you so long. How am I supposed to live without you. And how am I supposed to carry on. When all that I've been livin' for is gone. I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down. It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end. And how can I blame you when I built my world around. The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends. I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh. Even now it's more than I can take. Tell me how am I supposed to live without you. Now that I've been lovin' you so long. How am I supposed to live without you. And how am I supposed to carry on. When all that I've been livin' for is gone. No, I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming. Oh, now that your dream has come true. Tell me how am I supposed to live without you. Now that I've been lovin' you so long. How am I supposed to live without you. And how am I supposed to carry on. When all that I've been livin' for is gone. When all that I've been livin' for is gone. No, I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming. Oh, now that your dream has come true. Tell me how am I supposed to live without you. Now that I've been lovin' you so long. How am I supposed to live without you. And how am I supposed to carry on. When all that I've been livin' for is gone. Gone without you. Now that I've been been loving you so long. How am I supposed to live without you. And how am I supposed to carry on. When all that I've been living for is goneI won't let you down. I will not give you up. Gotta have some faith in the sound. It's the one good thing that I've got. I won't let you down. So please don't give me up. Because I would really. Really love to stick around. Heaven knows, I was just a young boy. Didn't know what I wanted to be. I was every little hungry schoolgirl's. Pride and joy. And I guess, it was enough for me. To win the race? A prettier face. Brand new clothes and a big fat place. On your rock and roll TV. But today the way I play the game. Is not the same. No way. Think I'm gonna get me some happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I told you so. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone else I've got to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Take back your singing in the rain. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you and you don't belong to me. Freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Heaven knows, we sure had some fun boy. What a kick just a buddy and me. We had every big shot good-time band. On the run boy. We were living in a fantasy. We won the race. Got out of the place. I went back home, got a brand new face. For the boys on MTV. But today, the way I play the game has got to change. Oh yeah. Now I'm gonna get myself happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I stopped the show. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone I forgot to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Don't think that I'll be back again. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you and you don't belong to me. Freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Well, it looks like the road to heaven. But it feels like the road to hell. When I knew which side. My bread was buttered. I took the knife as well posing for another picture. Everybody's got to sell but when you shake your ass. They notice fast. And some mistakes were built to last. That's what you get. I say that's what you get. That's what you get for changing. Your mind. And after all this time. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes. Do not make the man. I'll hold on to my freedom. May not be what you want from me. Just the way it's got to be. Lose the face now , I've got to liveI know that it's time for a change. Mmm but when that change comes. Will it still feel the same?. How many times have I tried. To turn this love around?. I don't wanna give up but, baby. It's time I had two feet on the ground. Can you release me? Can you release me?. Now that you're gone. I can't help myself from wondering. Ohh, if you'd have come down from your high. Would we've been all right?. Release me, can you release me?. Come on, baby, come on, baby. You knew it was time to just let go. 'Cause we wanna be free. But somehow it's just not that easy. Come on, darlin', hear me, darlin'. 'Cause you're a waste of time for me. I'm trying to make you see. That baby, you've just got to release me. Release me, release me. I'm not going back to you anymore. Finally my weakened heart is healing. Though very slow. So stop coming around my door. 'Cause you're not gonna find what you're looking for. Ohh, come on, baby, come on, baby. You knew it was time to just let go. 'Cause we wanna be free. Somehow it's just not that easy. Oh, oh, oh, baby. Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'. 'Cause you're a waste of time for me. I'm trying to make you see. That baby, you've just got to release me. Now tell me. What is this power you've got on me?. What is this power? Ohh. Come on, baby, come on, baby. You knew it was time to just let go. 'Cause we wanna be free. But somehow it's just not that easy. Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby. Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'. 'Cause you're a waste of time for me. I'm trying to make you see. That baby, you've just got to release me. Release me, release me. Release me, will you release me?. Ahh, release me. Release me, will you release me?All the lonely nights, I spend alone. Never around to love me, you're always gone. 'Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules. Oh, the man has come looking for you. You're a rebel now, don't give a damn. Always carrying on with the gang. I'm trying to tell you, boy, it's a mistake. You won't realize 'til it's too late. Don't understand why you insist. On ways of living such a dangerous life. Time after time, you stay away. And I just know that you're telling me lies. Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights. Living on the edge, not afraid to die. Heartbeat, real strong but not for long. Better watch your step or you're gonna die. You're so together, boy but just at a glance. You'll do anything if given a chance. Scheming, planning lies to get what you need. So full of promises that you never keep. Don't you tell yourself that it's okay. Sick and tired of all of your games. And you want me to stay, ah, better change. Makes no sense to me, your crazy ways. Don't understand why you insist. On ways of living such a dangerous life. Time after time, you stay away. And I just know that you're telling me lies. Not afraid to die. Black cat, black cat. Man, I don't understand your ways. Living on the edge. Don't understand why you insist. On ways of living such a dangerous life. Time after time, you stay away. And I just know that you're telling me lies. Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights. Living on the edge, not afraid to die. Heartbeat, real strong but not for long. Better watch your step or you're gonna die. Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights. Living on the edge, not afraid to die. Heartbeat, real strong but not for long. Better watch your step or you're gonna die. Black cat, living' on the. Heartbeat, better watch your stepSaying goodbye is never an easy thing. But you never said that you'd stay forever. So if you must go, well, darlin' I'll set you free. But I know in time that we'll be together. Oh, I won't try to stop you now from leaving. 'Cause in my heart I know. Love will lead you back, someday I just know that. Love will lead you back to my arms where you belong. I'm sure, sure as stars are shining. One day you will find me again, it won't be long. One of these days our love will lead you back. One of these nights, well I'll hear your voice again. You're gonna say, oh, how much you miss me. You walked out this door but someday you'll walk back in.

Do you remember?. Well, do you remember?. Do you remember?. There seemed no way to make up. Cause it seemed your mind was set. And the way you looked it told me. It's a look I know I'll never forget.

Oh, do you remember?. Do you remember?. Through all of my life. In spite of all the pain. You know that people are funny sometimes. They just can't wait to get hurt again. Tell me, do you remember?. Do you remember?. There are things we won't recall. And feelings we'll never find. It's taken so long to see it. Cause we never seemed to have the time.

The way it's supposed to be. I never imagined you could. Blow my theory apart but now you're running. Away with my heart. I don't wanna think about it. Don't wanna think clear. Don't analyze.

Close my eyes and I'm there with you. Like it was yesterday but then it fades away. Take me back, turn back the hands of time. When you kissed me in the warm September rain. (Warm September rain). Back before my heart was filled the pain. If only we could be in love that way again. If whishes came true and all the dreams at night. Of love were real, Id be holding you. If whishes came true. Then I would be that someone. Always special in your heart. We would be still be lovers, not apart. If whishes came true. Now yourè gone and Im on my own. Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye. In my dreams I still feel your touch. Lying next to me feeling esctacy. Take me back turn back the hands of time. When you kissed me in the warm September rain. (Warm September rain).

We would be still be lovers not apart. If whishes came true. EndI've been looking so long at these pictures of you. That I almost believe that they're real. I've been living so long with my pictures of you. That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel. Remembering you, standing quiet in the rain. As I ran to your heart to be near. And we kissed as the sky fell in,  holding you close. How I always held close in your fear. Remembering you, running soft through the night. You were bigger and brighter and whiter than snow. And screamed at the make believe, screamed at the sky. And you finally found all your courage to let it all go. Remembering you, fallen into my arms. Crying for the death of your heart. You were stone white, so delicate,  lost in the cold. You were always so lost in the dark. Remembering you, how you used to be. Slow drowned, you were angels. So much more than everything. Hold for the last time, then slip away quietly. Open my eyes, but I never see anything. If only I'd thought of the right words. I could have held on to your heart. If only I'd thought of the right words. I wouldn't be breaking apart. All my pictures of you. Looking so long at these pictures of you. But I never hold on to your heart. Looking so long for the words to be true. But always just breaking apart. My pictures of you. There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more. Than to feel you deep in my heart. There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more. Than to never feel the breaking apart. My pictures of youHere we are, face to face. We forget, time and place. Hold me now, don't let go. Though it hurts and we both know. The time we spend together's gonna fly. And everything you do to me is gonna feel so right. Baby when you're loving me I feel like I could cry. 'Cause there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you. No, no, no. Here we are, all alone. Trembling hearts, beating strong. Reaching out, breathless kiss. I never thought could feel like this. I want to stop the time from passing by. Wanna close my eyes and feel your lips are touching mine. Baby when you're close to me I want you more each time. And there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you. There's nothing I can do, I'm helpless in your arms. Baby what you do, I'm in love, this is it. There's no turning back this time. No, no, no. Here we are, once again. But this time we're only friends. Funny world, sometimes lies. Become the game, when love's the prize. And though no one knows what's going on inside. And all the love I feel for you is something I should hide. When I have you close to me, the feeling's so sublime. That there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you.

I've seen the bright get duller. I'm not going to spend my life being a color. Don't tell me you agree with me. When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye. But if you're thinkin' about my baby. It don't matter if you're black or white. I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby. It don't matter if you're black or white. I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother.

He takes me down and rocks me slow. And in the evening when the moon is high. He holds me close and won't let go, he won't let go. . He fills me up, he gives me love.

But whenever there's a problem. We always work it out somehow. Work it out somehow. They said, it wouldn't last. We had to prove them wrong. 'Cause I've learned in the past. That love will never do without you. Other guys have tried before. To replace you as my lover. Never did I have a doubt. Boy it's you, I can't do without. I feel better when I have you near me. 'Cause no other love around. Has quite the same, ooh ooh. Like you do, do, do, do babe. They said, it wouldn't last. We had to prove them wrong. 'Cause I've learned in the past. That love will never do without youWhy be afraid if I'm not alone?. Life is never easy, the rest in unknown. Up to now for me it's been hands against stone. Each and every moment searching for what to believe. Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now. And it's shinning on me. Coming out of the dark, I know the love that saved me. Sharing with me. Starting again is part of the plan. I'll be so much stronger holding your hand. Step by step, I'll make it through, I know I can. May not make it easier but I have felt you near all the way. Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now. And it's shinning on me, I see the light.

You're love is shinning on me, shinning on me, shinning on me. See the light, I see the light, shinning, shinning on me. I didn't think that I could take it but your love helped me to make it. Coming out of the dark, I see the light now, see the light nowIn a time. Where the sun descends alone. I ran a long, long way from home. To find a heart that's made of stone. I will try. I just need a little time. To get your face right out of my mind. To see the world through different eyes. Everytime I see you. Oh, I try to hide away. But when we meet it seems I can't let go. Everytime you leave the room. I feel I'm fading like a flower. Tell me why. When I scream, there's no reply. When I reach out, there's nothing to find. When I sleep, I break down and cry. Cry, yeah. Everytime I see you. Oh, I try to hide away. But when we meet it seems I can't let go. Everytime you leave the room. I feel I'm fading like a flower. Fading like a rose. Fading like a rose.

Won't you let me tell you why. One more try I didn't know how much I loved you. One more try let me put my arms around you. Living all these lonely nights without you. Oh baby can we give it one more try. It's been a long time since I kissed you. It always used to feel so good. And if you knew how much I missed you. You'd forgive me if you could.

Right here, right now. There is no other place I want to be. Right here, right now. Watching the world wake up from history. I saw the decade in, when it seemed the world could change. At the blink of an eye. And if anything. Then there's your sign of the times. I was alive and I waited, waited. I was alive and I waited for this. Right here, right now. I was alive and I waited, waited. I was alive and I waited for this. Right here, right now. There is no other place I want to be. Right here, right now. Watching the world wake up from history. Right here, right now. There is no other place I want to be. Right here, right now. Watching the world wake up from history. Right here, right now. There is no other place I want to be. Right here, right now. Watching the world wake upI'm talking, I'm talking. I believe in the power of love. I'm singing, I'm singing. I believe that you can rescue me. With you I'm not a little girl, with you I'm not a man. When all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand. You see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak. You see that I am silly, and pretentious and a freak. But I don't feel too strange for you, don't know exactly what you do. I think when love is pure, you try to understand the reasons why. And I prefer this mystery, it cancels out my misery. And gives me hope that there could be a person that loves me. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. Your love has given me hope. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. I'm drowning, baby, throw out your rope. With you I'm not a fascist, can't play you like a toy. And when I need to dominate, you're not my little boy. You see that I am hungry for a life of understanding. And you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding. You bring me to my knees while I'm scratching out the eyes. Of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise. And right while I am kneeling there, I suddenly begin to care. And understand that there could be a person that loves me. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. Your love has given me hope. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope. Love is understanding. It's hard to believe life can be so demanding. I'm sending out an SOS. Stop me from drowning baby, I'll do the rest. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. Your love has given me hope. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. I'm drowning, baby, throw out your rope. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. Your love has given me hope. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. I'm drowning, baby, throw out your rope. Ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding. Ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding. Love is understanding. It's hard to believe life can be so demanding. I'm sending out an SOS. Rescue me, rescue me. It's not my business to decide how good you are for me. How valuable you are and what the world can see. Only that you try to understand me. And have the courage to love me for me. I believe, I believe in the power of love. I believe that you can rescue me. I believe, I believe in the power of love. I believe that you can rescue me. I'm singing I believe. I believe that you can rescue me. I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing. I believe that you can rescue me. I'm talking, I'm talking. I believe in the power of love. I'm talking, I'm talking. I believe in the power of love. I'm singing, I'm singing, I believe. I believe that you can rescue me. Hey hey, hey hey. R E S C U E me. Only you can rescue me. Hey hey, heySome things in life are bad. They can really make you mad. Other things just make you swear and curse. When you're chewing on life's gristle. Don't grumble, give a whistle. And this'll help things turn out for the best. And always look on the bright side of life. Always look on the light side of life. If life seems jolly rotten. There's something you've forgotten. And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing. When you're feeling in the dumps. Don't be silly chumps. Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing. And always look on the bright side of life. Come on!. Always look on the right side of life. For life is quite absurd. And death's the final word. You must always face the curtain with a bow. Forget about your sin. Give the audience a grin. Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow. So, always look on the bright side of death. A-just before you draw your terminal breath. Life's a piece of shit. When you look at it. Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true. You'll see it's all a show. Keep 'em laughing as you go. Just remember that the last laugh is on you. And always look on the bright side of life. Always look on the right side of life. C'mon Brian, cheer up!. Always look on the bright side of life. Always look on the bright side of life. Worse things happen at sea, you know. Always look on the bright side of life. I mean, what have you got to lose. You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing. What have you lost? Nothing!. Always look on the right side of life.... Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?. Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!. There you are, see, it's the end of the film. Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer. Some of us have to got live as well, you know. Who do you think pays for all this rubbish. They're not gonna make their money back, you know. I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money backI remember how. The sun came shining through the trees. Made shadows on the road. I was driving home. The morning after with the taste of you. Still on my tongue. You are my safety zone. I live and breathe in you. I'll never find a better love not in a minute. I'll never find a better love not in a minute. Never a better love, never a better love. On the harbour bridge. The rain was gently falling down. On a lazy summer day. Your face appeared there on my windscreen. You smiled and slipped away. You are my safety zone. I live and breathe in you. I'll never find a better love not in a minute. I'll never find a better love not in a minute. Never a better love, never a better love. You are my safety zone. I live and breathe in you. You are where I belong. I live and breathe in you.

You were there like a blow torch burning. I was a key that could use a little turning. So tired that I couldn't even sleep. So many secrets I couldn't keep. Promised myself I wouldn't weep. One more promise I couldn't keep. It seems no one can help me now. I'm in too deep. There's no way out. This time I have really led myself astray. Runaway train never going back. Wrong way on a one-way track. Seems like I should be getting somewhere. Somehow I'm neither here nor there. Can you help me remember how to smile. Make it somehow all seem worthwhile. How on earth did I get so jaded. Life's mystery seems so faded. I can go where no one else can go. I know what no one else knows. Here I am just drowning in the rain. With a ticket for a runaway train. And everything seems cut and dry. Day and night, earth and sky. Somehow I just don't believe it. Runaway train never going back. Wrong way on a one-way track. Seems like I should be getting somewhere. Somehow I'm neither here nor there. Bought a ticket for a runaway train. Like the madman laughing at the rain. Little out of touch, little insane. It's just easier than dealing with the pain. Runaway train never going back. Wrong way on a one-way track. Seems like I should be getting somewhere. Somehow I'm neither here nor there. Runaway train never coming back. Runaway train tearing up the track. Runaway train burning in my veins. I run away but it always seems the sameCame in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue. Thought I heard you talking softly. I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio. Still, I can't escape the ghost of you. What has happened to it all?. Crazy, some'd say. Where is the life that I recognize?. Gone away. But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say. "Pride will tear us both apart". Well, now, pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away. Left me in the vacuum of my heart. What is happening to me?. Crazy, some'd say. Where is my friend when I need you most?. Gone away. But, I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. (Just blown away...). Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed. Fear today, forgot tomorrow. Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need. Ours is just a little sorrowed talk. And I don't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Every world, is my world (I will learn to survive). Any world, is my world (I will learn to survive). Any world, is my world. Every world is my worldThere's a hero. If you look inside your heart. You don't have to be afraid. Of what you are. There's an answer. If you reach into your soul. And the sorrow that you know. Will melt away. And then a hero comes along. With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside. And you know you can survive. So when you feel like hope is gone. Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth. That a hero lies in you. It's a long road. When you face the world alone. No one reaches out a hand. For you to hold. You can find love. If you search within yourself. And the emptiness you felt. Will disappear. And then a hero comes along. With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside. And you know you can survive. So when you feel like hope is gone. Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth. That a hero lies in you. Lord knows. Dreams are hard to follow. But don't let anyone. Tear them away. Hold on. There will be tomorrow. In time. You'll find the way. And then a hero comes along. With the strength to carry on. And you cast your fears aside. And you know you can survive. So when you feel like hope is gone. Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth. That a hero lies in you. That a hero lies in you. That a hero lies in youShare my life, take me for what I am. 'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you. Take my love, I'll never ask for too much. Just all that you are and everything that you do. I don't really need to look very much further. I don't want to have to go where you don't follow. I won't hold it back again, this passion inside. I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide. Don't make me close one more door. I don't wanna hurt anymore. Stay in my arms if you dare. Or must I imagine you there. Don't walk away from me. I have nothing, nothing, nothing. If I don't have you, you, you, you, you. You see through, right to the heart of me. You break down my walls with the strength of your love. I never knew love like I've known it with you. Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to. I don't really need to look very much further. I don't want to have to go where you don't follow. I won't hold it back again, this passion inside. I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide. Your love I'll remember forever. Oh, don't make me close one more door. I don't wanna hurt anymore. Stay in my arms if you dare. Or must I imagine you there. Don't walk away from me. I have nothing, nothing, nothing. Don't make me close one more door. I don't wanna hurt anymore. Stay in my arms if you dare. Or must I imagine you there. Don't walk away from me, no. Don't walk away from me.

Out of my dreams and into my life. You are the one, you are the one. Said I loved you but I lied. 'Cause this is more than love I feel inside. Said I loved you but I was wrong. 'Cause love could never ever feel so strong. Said I loved you but I lied. With all my soul I've tried in vain. How can mere words my heart explain. This taste of heaven so deep so true.

I fall deeper and deeper the further I go. Kisses sent from heaven above. They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know. When you know the notes to sing, you can sing 'most anything. That's what my mama told me. 'Round and 'round and 'round you go. When you find love, you'll always know. I let my father mold me. Daddy couldn't be all wrong.   (Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there). And my mama made me learn this song.   (You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you). That's why I can't help falling in love.

Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town. Where death waits in the darkness. With a weapon to cut some stranger down. Sleeping with an empty bottle. He's a sad and an empty hearted man. All he needs is a job. And a little respect. So, he can get out while he can. We always need to hear both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. A neighborhood peace is shattered. It's the middle of the night. Young faces hide in the shadows. While they watch their mother and father fight. He says she's been unfaithful. She says her love for him has gone. And the brother shrugs to his sister and says. "Looks like it's just us from now on". We always need to hear both sides of the story. We need to hear both sides of the story. And the lights are all on. The world is watching now. People looking for truth. We must not fail them now. Be sure, before we close our eyes. Don't walk away from here. 'Til you hear both sides. No, no, no, no. Here we are all gathered. In what seems to be the center of the storm. Neighbors once friendly. Now stand each side of the line that has been drawn. They've been fighting here for years. But, now there's killing on the streets. While small coffins are lined up sadly. Now united in defeat. We always need to hear both sides of the story. And the lights are all on. The world is watching now. People looking for truth. We must not fail them now. Be sure, before we close our eyes. Don't walk away from here. 'Til you see both sides. No, no, no, no, no, no. White man turns the corner. Finds himself within a different world. Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder. Throws him up against the wall. He says, would you respect me. If I didn't have this gun. 'Cos without it, I don't get it. And that's why I carry one. We always need to hear both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Oh, both sides of the story. Yes, both sides of the story. Oh, both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Both sides, both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Both sides of the story, Yeah, yeah. Both sides of the story. Both sides, both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Must hear both sides of the storyI will always be hoping, hoping. You will always be holding. Holding my heart in your hand. I will understand. I will understand someday, one day. You will understand always. Always from now until then. When it will be right? I don't know. What it will be like? I don't know. We live in hope of deliverance. From the darkness that surrounds us. Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance. From the darkness that surrounds us.   (From the darkness that surrounds us). And I wouldn't mind knowing, knowing. That you wouldn't mind going. Going along with my plan. When it will be right? I don't know. What it will be like? I don't know. We live in hope of deliverance. From the darkness that surrounds us.

In the dream of you.  (I want to understand you more and more and more). With all my heart and all my soul. (When I'm with you I feel like a magical child). That by sheer force of will, I will raise you from the ground. (Everything is strange). And without a sound you'll appear. (Everything is wild). And surrender to me, to love.

Digging deep for clues on higher ground. Moon and stars sit way up high. Earth and trees beneath them lie. The wind blows fragrant lullaby. To cool the night for you and I. On the wing the birds fly free. Leviathan tames angry sea. The flower waits for honeybee. The sunrise wakes new life in me. Every hour of every day I'm learning more. The more I learn, the less I know about before. The less I know, the more I want to look around. Digging deep for clues on higher ground. The fishes swim while rivers run. Through fields to feast my eyes upon. Intoxicated drinking from. The loving cup of burning sun. In dreams I'll crave familiar taste. Of whispered rain on weary face. Of kisses sweet and warm embrace.

When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright. It's Amazing. And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight. . That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation. And how high can you fly with broken wings?. Life's a journey not a destination. And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings. . You have to learn to crawl. Before you learn to walk. But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk. I was out on the street. Just tryin' to survive. Scratchin' to stay. Alive. . chorusTurn it up, turn it up, turn it upside down.

Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup, oh yeah. Got a fist of pure emotion, got a head of shattered dreams. Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now. Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it. I just want you back for good. Want you back, want you back, want you back for good. Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song and I'll sing it. You'll be right and understood. Want you back, want you back, I want you back for good. Unaware but underlined I figured out this story. Wasn't good. But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory. But that was not to be. In the twist of separation you excelled at being free. Can't you find a little room inside for me?. Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it. I just want you back for good. Want you back, want you back, see I want you back for good. Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song and I'll sing it. You'll be right and understood.

How could this be? You're not here with me. You never said good-bye, someone tell me why. Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?. Everyday I sit and ask myself. How did love slip away?. Something whispers in my ear and says. That you are not alone. I am here with you. Though you're far away. I am here to stay. You are not alone. I am here with you. Though we're far apart. You're always in my heart. You are not alone. All alone, why, oh.... Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry. Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms. I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear. But first I need your hand, then forever can begin. Everyday I sit and ask myself. How did love slip away?. Something whispers in my ear and says. That you are not alone. I am here with you. Though you're far away. I am here to stay. You are not alone. I am here with you. Though we're far apart. You're always in my heart. You are not alone.

Say your lines but do you feel them. Do you mean what you say. When there's no one around. (No one around). Watching you, watching me, one lonely star. (One lonely star you don't know who you are). I've always been in love with you. (Always with you). I guess you've always known it's true. (You know it's true). You took my love for granted, why? Oh, why?. The show is over, say goodbye. Say goodbye. (Bye, bye). Say goodbye. Make them laugh, it comes so easy. When you get to the part. Where you're breaking my heart. (Breaking my heart). Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown.   (Just make 'em smile, the whole world loves a clown). Wish you well, I cannot stay. You deserve an award for the role that you played. (Role that you played). No more masquerade, you're one lonely star. (One lonely star and you don't know who you are). I've always been in love with you. (Always with you).

I can't help it if I'm lucky". Only wanna be with you. Ain't Bobby so cool. Only wanna be with you. Yeah I'm tangled up in blue. Only wanna be with you. You can call me your fool. Only wanna be with you. Sometimes I wonder. If it will ever end. You get so mad at me. When I go out with my friends. Sometimes you're crazy. And you wonder why. I'm such a baby yeah.

Only wanna be with youWe've come so far and we've reached so high. And we've looked each day and night in the eye. And we're still so young and we hope for more. We've come a long way. But we're not too sure where we've been. We've had success, we've had good times. But remember this. Been on this path of life for so long. Feel I've walked a thousand miles. Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love. Everybody's been there. With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope. And I knew I could make it. Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw. My face in the moonlight. Just then I realized what a fool I could be. Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me. Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still. There's a road going down the other side of this hill. Never forget where you're coming from. Never pretend that it's all real. Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream. This will be someone else's dream. Safe from the arms of dissapoitment for so long. Feel each day we've come too far. Yet each day seems to make much more. Sure is good to be here. I understand the meaning of 'I can't explain this feeling' now. And it feels so unreal. At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made. The fact of reality. Never forget where you're coming from. Never pretend that it's all real. Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream. This will be someone else's dream. We've come so far and we've reached so high. And we've looked each day and night in the eye. And we're still so young and we hope for more. But remember this. We're not invincible, we're not invicible, no. We're only people, we're only people. Hey we're not invincible, we're not invicible. So again I tell you. Never forget where you're coming from. Never pretend that it's all real. Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream. This will be someone else's dream. Never, never forget where. Never pretend that it's all real. Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream. This will be someone else's dream. Never, everybody sing, oh baby. Never, no never, never forget for love. Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud. Never, everybody sing that song. Never, yeah louder, louder, loud now. Someday, come on, come on, everybody, everybody. Everybody, everybody, everybody. Never forget where you're coming from. Never pretend that it's all real. Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream. This will be someone else's dream. We've come so far and we've reached so high. And we've looked each day and night in the eye. And we're still so young and we hope for moreDon't want no short dick man. Don't want no short dick man. Don't want no short dick man. Don't want no short dick man.

Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind. She says "Dad's the one I love the most. But Stipe's not far behind". She never lets me in. Only tells me where she's been. When she's had too much to drink. I said that I don't care. I just run my hands through her dark hair. Then I pray to God, you gotta help me fly away. And just. Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain. Let her sing, if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me. And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Let her be. This morning I woke up alone. Found a note standin' by the phone. Saying "baby, maybe I'll be back someday". I wanted to look for you. You walked in; I didn't know just what I should do. So I sat back down and had a beer. And felt sorry for myself, sayin'. Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain. Let her sing, if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me. And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Let her be. Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain. Let her sing, if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me. And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Ahh.... Last night, I tried to leave. Cried so much, I could not believe. She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago. She went in the back to get high. I sat down on my couch and cried, yellin'. "Oh mama, please help me!. Won't you hold my hand and...?". Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain. Let her sing, if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me. And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain. Let her sing, if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me. And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Oh, let her be.Walk blindly to the light and reach out for his hand. Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand. Open up your mind and then open up your heart. And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart. 'Cause I believe that love is the answer. I believe that love will find the way. Violence is spread worldwide and there are families on the street. And we sell drugs to children now oh why can't we just see. That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today. Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay. But I believe that love is the answer. I believe that love will find the way. I believe that love is the answer. I believe that love will find the way. I've been seeing Lisa now for a little over a year. She said she's never been so happy but Lisa lives in fear.

I walk the maze of moments. but everywhere I turn to. begins a new beginning. but never finds a finish. I walk to the horizon. and there I find another. it all seems so surprising. and then I find that I know . . Chorus:. You go there you're gone forever. I go there I'll lose my way. if we stay here we're not together. Anywhere is . . The moon upon the ocean. is swept around in motion. but without ever knowing. the reason for its flowing. in motion on the ocean. the moon still keeps on moving. the waves still keep on waving. and I still keep on going . . Chorus . I wonder if the stars sign. the life that is to be mine. and would they let their light shine. enough for me to follow. I look up to the heavens. but night has clouded over. no spark of constellation. no Vela no Orion . . The shells upon the warm sands. have taken from their own lands. the echo of their story. but all I hear are low sounds. as pillow words are weaving. and willow waves are leaving. but should I be believing. . Chorus . To leave the thread of all time. and let it make a dark line. in hopes that I can still find. the way back to the moment. I took the turn and turned to. begin a new beginning. still looking for the answer. I cannot find the finish. It's either this or that way. it's one way or the other. it should be one direction. it could be on reflection. the turn I have just taken. the turn that I was making. I might be just beginning. I might be near the end.Your arms are warm but they make me feel. As if they're made of cold, cold steel. A simple kiss like a turnin' key. A little click and the lock's on me. Can't move my arms, can't lift my hands. I won't admit to where I am. But I know baby, I'm in chains. I'm in chains. I pretend I can always leave. Free to go whenever I please. But then the sound of my desperate calls. Echo off these dungeon walls. I've crossed the line from mad to sane. A thousand times and back again. I love you baby, I'm in chains. I'm in chains. I'm in chains. I'm in chains. Should have known passing through the gate. That once inside I could not escape. I never thought this could happen to me. Never thought this is where I'd be. But baby, baby, baby, look at me. Baby, baby, look at me, I'm in chains. I'm in chains. I never thought this is where I'd be. Never thought this could happen to meMmm, mmm, mmm. Ooh... whoa... oh... oh... oh.... Oh, yeah. You were lookin' so good to me. The night we met, I could not see. How deep you were to penetrate my heart, mmm. Now that some time has passed. It made me think this was meant to last. I never want to be apart, oh, no, no. Don't let me fool you.

I guess you heard me cry. You smiled at me. Like, Jesus to a child. I'm blessed, I know. Heaven sent, heaven stole. You smiled at me. Like, Jesus to a child. And what have I learned. From all this pain. I thought I never feel the same. About anyone. Or anything again. But now I know. When you find love. When you know that it exists. Then the lover that you miss. Will come to you on those cold, cold nights. When you've been loved. When you know it holds such bliss. Then the lover that you kissed. Will comfort you when there is no hope in sight. Sadness in my eyes. No one guessed, well no one tried. You smiled at me. Like, Jesus to a child. Loveless and cold. With your last breathe you saved my soul. You smiled at me. Like, Jesus to a child. And what have I learned. From all these tears. I've waited for you all those years. Then just when it began. He took your love away. But I still say. When you find love. When you know that it exists. Then the lover that you miss. Will come to you on those cold, cold nights. When you've been loved. When you know it holds such bliss. Then the lover that you kissed. Comfort you when there is no hope in sight. So the words you could not say. I'll sing them for you. And the love we would have made. I'll make it for two. For every single memory.

But now, we're going 'round in circles. Tell me will this déjà vu never end, oh. And now you tell me that you're falling in love. Well I never ever thought that would be, eh. This time, you gotta take it easy. Throwing far too much emotions at me. But any fool can see they're falling. I gotta make you understand. I'm giving you everything. All that joy can bring. This I swear (I'll give you everything). And all that I want from you. Is a promise you will be there. Say you will be there, ow. Say you will be there. Won't you sing it with me. If you put two and two together. You will see what our friendship is for, oh. If you can't work this equation. Then I guess I'll have to show you the door. There is no need to say you love me. It would be better left unsaid. I'm (I'm) giving you everything (I'll give you everything). All that joy can bring (All that joy can bring). This I swear (Yes, I swear).

Of light mists with pale amber rose. Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent. Touching, discovering you. Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me. Miles of windless sumkmer nights. Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon. Out of the stillness, soft spoken words. Say it, say it again. I love you always forever. Near or far, closer together. Everywhere I will be with you. Everything I will do for you. Say it, say it again. I love you always forever. Near or far, closer together. Everywhere I will be with you. Everything I will do for you. You've got. The most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen. You've got. Me almost melting away. As we lay there. Under a blue sky with pure white stars. Exotic sweetness. A magical time. Say it, say it again. I love you always forever. Near or far, closer together. Everywhere I will be with you. Everything I will do for you. Say it, say it again. I love you always forever. Near or far, closer together. Everywhere I will be with you. Everything I will do for you.

Return of the mackDeep in the bosom of the gentle night. Is when I search for the light. Pick up my pen and start to write. I struggle, fight dark forces. In the clear moon light. Without fear... insomnia. I can't get no sleep. . I used to worry, thought I was goin' mad in a hurry. Gettin' stress, makin' excess mess in darkness. No electricity, something's all over me, greasy. Insomnia please release me and let me dream of. Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath. Tearin' off tights with my teeth. But there's no release, no peace. I toss and turn without cease. Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast. At least a couple of weeks. Since I last slept, kept takin' sleepers. But now I keep myself pepped. Deeper still, that night I write by candle light. I find insight, fundamental movement, uh. So when it's back this insomniac take an original tack. Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack. I gets no sleep. I can't get no sleep. . I can't get no sleep. I can't get no sleep. I need to sleep, although I get no sleep. I need to sleep, although I get no sleepI feel like I've been blown apart, there are pieces here. I don't know where they go, I don't know where they go. Kiss me on my salty lips, I bet you feel a little crazy. But for me, we'll be famous on TV. Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?. Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?. When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it. And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it. I jump up on you, you jump on me, you push me out. And even though you know I love you, I'd be inclined. To slap you in the mouth, when I kiss your salty lips. You will feel a little crazy but for me, I'll be famous on TV. Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?. Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?. When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it. And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it. Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?. Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?. When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it. And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it. Now, will it be my fault if I take your love and throw it wide?. You might restrain me but could you really blame me?. And you will feel you're blown apart, all the pieces there will fit. To make you whole and I know where they go. Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?. Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?. When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it. And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it. When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it. And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it. When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it. And turn you upside down, don't want to waste itOoo Heh heh, Oh, what we're living in, let me tell ya. It is a wonder man can eat at all. When things are big that should be small. Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us. And I'm giving all my love to this world. Only to be told. I can't see, I can't breathe. No more will we be. And nothing's going to change the way we live. 'Cause we can always take but never give. And now that things are changing for the worse. See, whoa, it's a crazy world we're living in. And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin. Is all we have to give these. Futures made of virtual insanity now. Always seem to be governed by this love we have for. Useless, twisting, of our new technology. Oh now there is no sound, for we all live underground. And I'm thinking what a mess we're in. Hard to know where to begin. If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made. And now every mother can choose the colour of her child. That's not nature's way. Well that's what they said yesterday. There's nothing left to do but pray. I think it's time to find a new religion. Whoa, It's so insane. To synthesize another strain. There's something in these. Futures that we have to be told. Futures made of virtual insanity now. Always seem to be governed by this love we have for. useless, twisting, of our new technology. Oh now there is no sound, for we all live underground. Now there is no sound if we all live underground. If there was virtual insanity. Forget your virtual reality. Oh, there's nothing so bad. As a man-made man, oh yeah, I know. Yeah. Ooh. Futures made of virtual insanity now. Always seem to be governed by this love we have for. Useless, twisting, of the new technology. Oh now there is no sound, for we all live underground. Now this life that we live in. It's so wrong. Shout out the window. Do you know that. There is nothing worse than a man-made man. Still there's nothing worse than a foolish man, hey.

Don't let me out of your sight. Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite. So don't let me have any rights. Oh, I've had it up to here. The moment that I step outside. So many reasons for me to run and hide. I can't do the little things I love so dear. 'Cause it's all those little things that I fear. 'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be. 'Cause they won't let me drive late at night. I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak. 'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes. Oh, I'm just a girl take a good look at me. Just your typical prototype, oh, I've had it up to here. Oh, am I making myself clear?. I'm just a girl, I'm just a girl in the world. That's all that you'll let me be. Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity. Your rule of thumb make me worry so. Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?. What I've succumbed to is making me numb. Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies. What I've become is so burdensome. Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me. Twiddle dum there's no comparison. Oh, I've had it up to. Oh, I've had it up to. Oh, I've had it up to hereWarren G, rap for me, yeah-eah, yeah. When G-dog, the hog, come up in the place. There's dollar signs in your eyes and a smile in your face. You wanna live fat, all for my sack. You got more drag than a low lo-do, cut the act. 'Cause back before 92 and 93. You didn't give a damn about Warren G. But now that I'm slingin' platinum LP's. All of a sudden, you on my NUT's. Ain't nothin' you can do to make it stop. 'Cause money makes the world go 'round and the panties drop. I ain't in love though, I don't need the pressure. I just wanna dig it like I'm diggin' for treasure. Some of y'all had a good thing that you couldn't keep. Thought you was TLC, you had to creep. You say you had love, I said you bullshit. It's all about the dough, so what's love got to do with it?. What's love got to do, got to do with it?. (That's right ). What's love if you don't respect the game?. (Uh huh). What's love got to do, got to do with it?. If you lack in this game, it's a shame, you won't make it. Now, I'm the type of brother that's down for mines. Before I made beats, I was down to grind. Back then, every single homey had my back. Now they're peepin' my stack and they're talkin' 'bout Jack. But I'm the same brother day in and day out. And I'm-a stay that way until the day I lay out. In a casket it's drastic, 'cause homies is plastic. Break 'em off some bread, they want the whole damn basket. If you's a true homey, you would wish me well. Not plot to make a brother fell, jealous as hell. We used to get the same riches. Now your trigger-finger got the itches, schemin' on my riches. Which is not a suprise, my eyes peep game. 211's, 187's it's all the same. It's all a shame, homies'd jack you for your grip. Ain't no love involved, because it's all about the chips. What's love got to do, got to do with it?. (That's right ). What's love if you don't respect the game?. (Uh huh). What's love got to do, got to do with it?. (That's right). If you lack in this game, it's a shame, you won't make it. Now for these labels tellin' fables. Makin' them fucked up deals under the tables. You think that you smart, but, fool, I'm the smartest. You can't make no money if you can't keep a artist. Sign the dotted line, put 'em on the shelf. Break 'em off some crumbs, keep the rest for yourself. I know how it goes, treat a artist like you know. Fly cars, gold, clothes but no dough. Since it's all business, I'm-a handle mine. Keep track of my stack down to the very last dime. 'Cause in this rap game, it's all about the buck. You bend over for the label and you will get bucked. Like how we run up in the trick and then you're through. The record label do the same thing to you. 90 percent business, 10 percent show. Ain't no love in this game, 'cause it's all about the dough. What's love got to do, got to do with it?. (That's right). What's love if you don't respect the game?. (Uh huh). What's love got to do, got to do with it?. (That's right). If you lack in this game, it's a shame, you won't make it.

Without leaving a piece of youth. And our lives are forever changed. We will never be the same. The more you change the less you feel. Believe, believe in me, believe, believe.

Oh, I really should have known. By the time you drove me home. By the vagueness in your eyes. Your casual good byes. By the chill in your embrace. The expression on your face that told me. Maybe you might have some advice to give. On how to be insensitive, insensitive, insensitive. How do you numb your skin. After the warmest touch?. How do you slow your blood. After the body rush?. How do you free your soul. After you've found a friend?. How do you teach your heart. to fall in love again?. Oh, you probably won't remember me. It's probably ancient history. I'm one of the chosen few. Who went ahead and fell for you. I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch. I fell too fast, I feel too much. I thought that you might have some advice to give.

Always felt I was outside looking in on you.. You're always the mysterious one with. Dark eyes and careless hair,. You were fashionably sensitive. But too cool to care.. You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say. Besides some comment on the weather.. Well in case you failed to notice,. In case you failed to see,. This is my heart bleeding before you,. This is me down on my knees, and.... These foolish games are tearing me apart,. And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart.. You're breaking my heart.. You're always brilliant in the morning,. Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee.. Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you.. You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones. As I clumsily strummed my guitar.. You'd teach me of honest things,. Things that were daring, things that were clean.. Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.. I hid my soiled hands behind my back.. Somewhere along the line, I must have gone. Off track with you.. Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else,. Somebody who gave a damn,. Somebody more like myself.. These foolish games are tearing me,. You're tearing me,. You're tearing me apart,. And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart.. You're breaking my heart.. You took your coat off,. Stood in the rain,. You're always crazy like that.When I was young. I never needed anyone. And making love was just for fun. Those days are gone. Livin' alone. I think of all the friends I've known. When I dial the telephone. Nobody's home. All by myself. Don't wanna be. All by myself. Anymore. Hard to be sure. Sometimes I feel so insecure. And loves so distant and obscure. Remains the cure.

I never thought you would become the friend I never had. Back then I didn't know why. Why you were misunderstood. So now I see through your eyes. All that you did was love. Mama, I love you, Mama, I care. Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend. You're my friend. I didn't want to hear it then but, I'm not ashamed to say it now. Every little thing you said and did was right for me. I had a lot of time to think about, about the way I used to be. Never had a sense of my responsibility. Back then I didn't know why. Why you were misunderstood. So now I see through your eyes. All that you did was love. Mama, I love you, Mama, I care. Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend. You're my friend, you're my friend.

Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one. They're saying. Mama never loved her much. And daddy never keeps in touch. That's why she shies away from human affection. But somewhere in a private place. She packs her bags for outer space. And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come. (and she'll say to him). She's saying. I would fly to the moon and back. If you'll be, if you'll be my baby. Got a ticket for a world where we belong. So would you be my baby?. Ooh-ooh. She can't remember a time when she felt needed. If love was red then she was color-blind. All her friends they've been tried for treason. And crimes that were never defined. She's saying. Love is like a barren place. And reaching out for human faith. Is like a journey I just don't have a map for. So baby gonna take a dive and. push the shift to overdrive. Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars. (What a pleasant dream). Just saying. I would fly to the moon and back. If you'll be, if you'll be my baby.

Always been told that I've got too much pride. Too independent to have you by my side. But my heart said all of you will see. Just won't live for someone until he'll live for me.

She says days go by, I'm hypnotized. I'm walking on a wire. I close my eyes and fly out of my mind. Into the fire. Sunny came home with a list of names. She didn't believe in transcendence. And it's time for a few small repairs, she said. Sunny came home with a vengeance. She says days go by, I don't know why. I'm walking on a wire. I close my eyes and fly out of my mind. Into the fire. Get the kids and bring a sweater. Dry is good and wind is better. Count the years, you always knew it. Strike a match, go on and do it. Oh, days go by, I'm hypnotized. I'm walking on a wire. I close my eyes and fly out of my mind. Into the fire. Oh, light the sky and hold on tight. The world is burning down. She's out there on her own, and she's all right. Sunny came home.

You don't seem to know. Seem to care what your heart is for. But I don't know him anymore. There's nothing where he used to lie. The conversation has run dry. That's what's going on. Nothing's fine, I'm torn. I'm all out of faith. This is how I feel. I'm cold and I am shamed. Lying naked on the floor. Illusion never changed. Into something real. I'm wide awake and I can see. The perfect sky is torn. You're a little late, I'm already torn. So I guess the fortune teller's right. Should have seen just what was there. And not some holy light. It crawled beneath my veins.

Lying naked on the floor. Illusion never changed. Into something real. I'm wide awake and I can see. The perfect sky is torn. You're a little late, I'm already torn, torn. There's nothing where he used to lie. My inspiration has run dry. That's what's going on. Nothing's right, I'm torn. I'm all out of faith. This is how I feel. I'm cold and I am shamed. Lying naked on this floor. Illusion never changed. Into something real. I'm wide awake and I can see. The perfect sky is torn. I'm all out of faith. This is how I feel. I'm cold and I'm ashamed.

Pras Michel featuring Ol' Dirty Bastard & Mya. Album: Bulworth (The Soundtrack). [Ol' Dirty Bastard]. Man, man look up at the sky. All the stars man, the stars look beautiful tonight. Look at em!. Chorus: Mya. Ghetto superstar, that is what you are. Comin' from afar, reachin' for the stars. Run away with me, to another place. We can rely on each other, uh-huh. From one corner to another, uh-huh. [Pras]. Uh, yeah, yo, yo. Some got hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means. The supreme dream team, always up with the schemes. From hubcaps to sellin' raps, name your theme. My rise to the top, floatin' on this cream. Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me. A million refugees with unlimited warranties. Black Caesar, dating top skeezers. Diplomatic legalese, no time for a Visa. They just begun, I'ma shoot them one by one. Got five sides to me, somethin' like a pentagon. Strike with the forces of King Solomon. Lettin' bygones be bygones and so on and so on. I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto. Keepin' it retro-spective from the get-go. Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo. P-Politic with ghetto senators on the deelow. Chorus. [Ol' Dirty Bastard]. One two, and you don't stop, yo. My eyes are sore, bein' a senator. Behind closed doors hittin' truth to the seafloor. The rich go north ignore, the tug of war. While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores. So, I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more. I'ma reveal EVERYTHING, change the law. I find myself, walkin' the streets. Tryin' to find what's really goin' on in the streets. [Pras]. Yea, yo, yo, yo. Now every dog got his day, needless to say. When the chief away, that's when them cats want to play. I told you, mess around with fools like Cassius Clay. Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree. Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin' ballet. Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway. Get applause like a matador, cry yellin' !Ole!. Who the hell wanna' save me, from B.K., to Cali. Come on. Chorus. [Pras]. Yeah...yo, yeah. Just when you thought it was safe in a common place. Showcase your finest is losin' fast in the horse race. Two faced, gettin' defaced, out like Scarface. Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface. [Ol' Dirty Bastard]. Well I'm paranoid at the things I said. Wonderin' what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin' out. Partyin' with girls that never die, you see I was. Pickin' on the small fries, my campaign tellin' lies. Was just spreadin' my love, didn't know my love. Was the one holdin' the gun and the glove. But it's all good as long as it's understood. It's all together now, in the hooooooooooooooooooooooooooood. Chorus. [Pras]. Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh. Yeah. All stars, yeah yeah yeah. Chorus.

From: "Rick Thompson"Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder. Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?. She's got herself a universe gone quickly. For the call of thunder threatens everyone. And I feel like I just got home. And I feel. And I feel like I just got home. And I feel. Faster than the speeding light she's flying. Trying to remember where it all began. She's got herself a little piece of heaven. Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one. And I feel like I just got home. And I feel. And I feel like I just got home. And I feel. Quicker than a ray of light. Quicker than a ray of light. Quicker than a ray of light. Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder. Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?. She's got herself a universe gone quickly. For the call of thunder threatens everyone. And I feel. Quicker than a ray of light. Then gone for. Someone else will be there. Through the endless years. She's got herself a universe. She's got herself a universe. She's got herself a universe. And I feel. And I feel. And I feel like I just got home. And I feel. Quicker than a ray of light she's flying. Quicker than a ray of light I'm flyingUnemployment at a record high. People coming, people going, people born to die. Don't ask me, because I don't know why. But it's like that, and that's the way it is. People in the world try to make ends meet. You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet. I said you got to work hard you want to compete. It's like that, and that's the way it is. Money is the key to end all your woes. Your ups and downs, your highs and your lows. Won't you tell me last time that love bought you clothes. It's like that, and that's the way it is. Bills fly higher every day. We receive much lower pay. I'd rather stay young, go out and play. It's like that, and that's the way it is. War's going on across the sea. Street soldiers killing the elderly. What ever happened to unity. It's like that, and that's the way it is. Disillusion is the word. That's used by me when I'm not heard. I just go through life with my glasses blurred. It's like that, and that's the way it is. You can see a lot in this lifespan. Like a bum eating out of a garbage can. You notice one time he was your man. It's like that, and that's the way it is. (What?). You should've gone to school, you could've learned a trade. But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid. Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid. It's like that, and that's the way it is. (What?). You know it's like that, and that's the way it is. Because it's like that, and that's the way it is. You know it's like that, and that's the way it is. Because it's like that. Check this out.

It's like that, and that's the way it is. (What?). If you really think about it times aren't that bad. The one that stretches for successes will make you glad. Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad. It's like that, and that's the way it is. (What?). Check this out. You know it's like that, and that's the way it is.

Thank you India, thank you terror. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you frailty, thank you consequence. Thank you, thank you silence. How 'bout me not blaming you for everything. How 'bout me enjoying the moment for once. How 'bout how good it feels to finally forgive you. How 'bout grieving it all one at a time. Thank you India, thank you terror. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you frailty, thank you consequence. Thank you, thank you silence. The moment I let go of it was. The moment I got more than I could handle. The moment I jumped off of it was. The moment I touched down. How 'bout no longer being masochistic. How 'bout remembering your divinity. How 'bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out. How 'bout not equating death with stopping. Thank you India, thank you providence. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you nothingness, thank you clarity. Thank you, thank you silence, yeahDo you still remember how we used to be. Feeling together, believe in whatever my love has said to me. Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun. Felt like my savior, my spirit I gave you, we'd only just begun. Hasta Manana, always be mine. Viva forever, I'll be waiting. Everlasting like the sun. Live forever for the moment. Ever searching for the one. Yes, I still remember every whispered word. The touch of your skin giving life from within like a love song that I'd heard. Slipping through our fingers like the sands of time. Promises made, every memory saved has reflections in my mind. Hasta Manana, always be mine. Viva forever, I'll be waiting. Everlasting like the sun. Live forever for the moment. Ever searching for the one. Back where I belong now, was it just a dream?. Feelings unfold, they will never be sold and the secret's safe with me. Hasta Manana, always be mine. Viva forever, I'll be waiting. Everlasting like the sun. Live forever for the moment. Ever searching for the one. ...Oh ohh. Hey hey. Oh ohh. Oh ohh. I say Hey boy sittin' in your tree. Mummy always wants you to come for tea. Don't be shy, straighten up your tie.

Contemplate my fate?. Do they know. The places where we go. When we're gray and old. 'Cause I've been told. That salvation. Lets their wings unfold. . So when I'm lyin' in my bed. Thoughts runnin' through my head. And I feel that love is dead. I'm lovin' angels instead. . And through it all. She offers me protection. A love and affection. Whether I'm right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won't break me. When I come to call. She won't forsake me. I'm lovin' angels instead. . When I'm feelin' weak. And my pain walks down. A one way street. I look above. And I know I'll always be blessed with love. . And as the feeling grows. She breathes flesh to my bones. An' when love is dead. I'm lovin' angels instead. . And through it all. She offers me protection. A lot of love and affection. Whether I'm right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won't break me. When I come to call. She won't forsake me. I'm lovin' angels instead. . And through it all. She offers me protection. A lot of love and affection.

Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me. (Pleases me). But short time solution ain't no resolution. That ain't no release for me. Too much of something is bad enough. But something's coming over me to make me wonder. Too much of nothing is just as tough. I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. Unwrap myself from around my finger. Hold me too tight or left to linger. Something fine built to last. Slipped up there I guess we're running out of time too fast. Yes my dear you know he shows me. (Moves me). There's no complication there's no explanation. It's just a groove in me. Too much of something is bad enough. (Bad enough). But something's coming over me to make me wonder. Too much of nothing is just as tough. (Just as tough). I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. What part of no don't you understand. (Understand, understand). I want a man not a boy who thinks he can. Boy who thinks he can. Too much of something is bad enough. But something's coming over me to make me wonder. Too much of nothing is just as tough. I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. Too much of something is bad enough. (Bad enough). But something's coming over me to make me wonder. Too much of nothing is just as tough. (Just as tough). I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try. Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie. Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try. Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie. Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try. Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie. Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try. Too much of something we're gonna be living a lieSometimes, the feeling is right.

Some say that we are players, some say that we are pawns. But we've been makin' money since the day that we were born. Got some slow downs, cause we'll low down. .

'Cause we know we're fallin' from graceWe made up their minds and they started packing. We left before the sun came up that day. An exit to eternal summer slacking. But where were they going without ever knowing the way?. We drank up the wine and they got to talking. We now had more important things to say. And when the car broke down they started walking. Where were they going without ever knowing the way?. Anyone could see the road that they walk on is paved in gold. And it's always summer, they'll never get cold. They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and gray. You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere. They won't make it home but they really don't care. They wanted the highway they're happier there today, today. The children woke up and they couldn't find 'em. We left before the sun came up that day. We just drove off and left it all behind 'em.

And useless in times like these. I won't be made useless. I won't be idle with despair. I will gather myself around my faith. For light does the darkness most fear. My hands are small, I know. But they're not yours, they are my own. But they're not yours, they are my own. And I am never broken. Poverty stole your golden shoes. But it didn't steal your laughter. And heartache came to visit me. But I knew it wasn't ever after. We'll fight, not out of spite. For someone must stand up for what's right. 'Cause where there's a man who has no voice. There ours shall go singing . My hands are small I know. But they're not yours, they are my own. But they're not yours, they are my own. And I am never broken. In the end only kindness matters.

In the Hollywood hills and the Boulevard. Her parents threw big parties everyone was there. They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper. Bob Seeger and Sonny and Cher. And she feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax. And from the stage I can tell that she can't let go and she can't relax. And just before she hangs her head to cry. I sing to her a lullaby. I sing. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Rockabye. She still lives with her Mom outside the city. Down that street about a half a mile. And all her friends tell her. She's so pretty. But she'd be a whole lot prettier. If she smiled once in a while. 'Cause even her smile looks like a frown. And she's seen her share of devils in this angel town. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye, rockabye. I told her I ain't so sure about this place. It's hard to play a gig in this town. Keep a straight face. And seems like everybody's got a plan. It's kind of like Nashville with a tan. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. So rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Rockabye. Bye bye. Bye byeGood looking, bad tasting. Full bodied, butt wasted. Loose living, tight fitting. What you see ain't what you are getting. Big make up, little break up. She wants it, he's got it. Cold blooded, hot gossip. Superficial expectations. Look at me, you can take it all. Because this face is free. Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Baby, I can even do reality. Fake honey, real plastic. Stupid cupid, fantastic. Queer thinking, straight talking. What you see ain't what you are getting. Fast loving, slow moving. No rhythm but I'm grooving. Old feeling, new beginning. Superficial expectations. Look at me, you can take it all. Because this face is free. Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Baby, I can even do reality. That's me. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Sometimes I don't recognize my own face. I look inside my eyes and find disgrace. My little white lies tell a story. I see it all, it has no glory. Look at me, you can take it all. Because this face is free. Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Baby, I can even do reality. Come on and look at me. This face is free, I'm your fantasy. So who'd you wanna be, not what you see. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Come on and look at me, I'm your fantasy. This face is freeDay after day. Time passed away. And I just can't get you off my mind. Nobody knows, I hide it inside. I keep on searching but I can't find. The courage to show to letting you know. I've never felt so much love before. And once again I'm thinking about. Taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah). How will I know if I let you go?. Night after night I hear myself say. Why can't this feeling just fade away?. There's no one like you (No one like you). You speak to my heart (Speak to my heart). It's such a shame we're worlds apart. I'm too shy to ask, I'm too proud to lose but sooner or later I gotta choose. And once again I'm thinking about. Taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah). How will I know if I let you go?. If I let you go ooh baby. Ooooohh. Once again I'm thinking about taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me?

Over this town followin' you. Over the trees, subways and cars. I'd try to find out who you really are. In the middle of the night. Cool, sweatin' in my bed. Got the windows open wide. Thinkin' about all the things you said. I wish I could fly out in the blue. Over this town followin' you. I'd fly over rooftops, the great boulevards. To try to find out who you really are, who you really are. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly around and around. Over this town, the dirt on the ground. I'd follow your course of doors left ajar. To try to find out who you really are, who you really are. I'd fly and fly and fly, I wish I could fly. I wake up in a dream in the middle of the night. I wish I could fly, I wish I could flyMadonna. Ray Of Light. Nothing Really Matters. When I was very young. Nothing really mattered to me.

Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti. Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti. Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti. I dream of rain. I dream of gardens in the desert sand. I wake in vain. I dream of love as time runs through my hand. I dream of fire. Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire. And in the flames. Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire. This desert rose. Each of her veils, a secret promise. This desert flower. No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this. And as she turns. This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams. This fire burns. I realize that nothing's as it seems. I dream of rain. I dream of gardens in the desert sand. I wake in vain. I dream of love as time runs through my hand. I dream of rain. I lift my gaze to empty skies above. I close my eyes. This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love. Aman aman aman. Omry feek antia. Ma ghair antia. Ma ghair antia. hair antia. I dream of rain. I dream of gardens in the desert sand. I wake in vain. I dream of love as time runs through my hand. Sweet desert rose. Each of her veils, a secret promise. This desert flower. No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this. Sweet desert rose. This memory of Eden haunts us all. This desert flower. This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the fall. (Ya lili ah ya leel)(Can you fill me in). I was checking this girl next door. When her parents went out. She phoned said hey boy, come on right around. So I knock at the door. You was standing with a bottle of red wine. Ready to pour. Dressed in all that Satin and Lace to the floor. So I went in. Then we sat down start kissing. Caressing. Told me about Jacuzzi. Sounded interesting. So we jumped right in. All calls diverted to answerphone. Please leave a message after the tone. I'm not being mean. Her Parents were kinda cool. But they ran a fine line between me and you. we were just doing things young people in love do. Parents trying to find out what we were up to. Saying why were you creeping round late last night. Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light. Now you're dressed in black. When I left you were dressed in white. Can you fill me in. Calls diverted to answerphone. Red wine bottle half the contents gone. Midnight return Jacuzzi turned on. Can you fill me in. Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out. I'd say hey girl, come on right around. So she knocked at the door. I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4. Jumped in my ride. Checking that nobody saw. The club we went in. We got down down down to the rhythm. Saw it was early morning. Thought we'd better be leaving. So I gave you my jacket for you to hold. Told you to wear it cause you felt cold. I'm not being mean. I didn't mean to break the rules. I weren't trying to play your Mum and Dad for fools. We were just doing things young people end up doing. Parents trying to find out what we were up to. Saying why can't you keep your promises no more. Say you'll be home by 12 come strolling in at 4. Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door. Can you fill me in. Wearing a jacket who's property. Said you'd been queuing for a Taxi. But you left all your money on the TV. Can you fill me in. (Can you fill me in). All they seem to do. Is be checking up on you. Baby. (Craig David). Watching our every move. Think some day they might approve. Baby. Why were you creeping round late last night. Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light. Now you're dressed in black. When I left you were dressed in white. Can you fill me in. (Can you fill me in). Calls diverted to answerphone. Red wine bottle half the contents gone. Midnight return Jacuzzi turned on. Can you fill me in. (Can you fill me in)On my way to see my friends. who lived a couple blocks away from me (owh).

When I stand here taking every breath with you. You're the only one who really knew me at all. How can you just walk away from me. When all I can do is watch you leave. 'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain. And even shared the tear. You're the only one who really knew me at all. So take a look at me now. 'Cause there's just an empty space. There's nothing left here to remind me. Just the memory of your face. So take a look at me now. 'Cause there's just an empty space. And you coming back to me is against the odds. And that's what I've got to face. I wish I could just make you turn around. Turn around and see me cry. There's so much I need to say to you. So many reasons why. You're the only one who really knew me at all. So take a look at me now. And there's just an empty space. There's nothing left here to remind me. Just the memory of your face. So take a look at me now. 'Cause there's just an empty space. But to wait for you is all I can do. And that's what I've got to face. Take a good look at me now. 'Cause l'll still be standing here. And you coming back to me is against all odds. That's the chance I've got to take. Oh, take a look at me nowWhen I'm lost in the rain. In your eyes I know I'll find the light. To light my way, when I'm scared losing ground. When my world is going crazy you can turn it all around. And when I'm down you're there pushing me to the top. You're always there giving me all you've got. For a shield, from the storm for a friend, for a love. To keep me safe and warm, I turn to you. For the strength to be strong, for the will to carry on. For everything you do, for everything that's true, I turn to you. When I lose the will to win. I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again. I can do anything 'cause your love is so amazing. 'Cause your love inspires me. And when I need a friend you're always on my side. Giving me faith taking me through the night. For a shield, from the storm, for a friend, for a love. To keep me safe and warm, I turn to you. For the strength to be strong and for the will to carry on. For everything you do I turn to you yeah. For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain. For truth that will never change for someone to lean on. But for a heart I can rely on through anything. For the one who I can run to oh I turn to you. For a shield from the storm, for a friend, for a love. To keep me safe and warm, I turn to you. For the strength to be strong, for the will to carry on. For everything you do, for everything that's true. For everything you do, for everything that's true, I turn to youWhen the world is darker than I can understand.. When nothing turns out the way I planned.. When the sky turns grey and there's no end in sight.. When I can't sleep through the lonely night.. . I turn to you. Like a flower leaning toward the sun.. I turn to you. 'Cos you're the only one.. Who can turn me around when I'm upside down.. I turn to you.. . When my insides are wracked with anxiety.. You have the touch that will quiet me.. You lift my spirit. You melt the ice.. When I need inspiration, when I need advice.. . I turn to you. Like a flower leaning toward the sun.. I turn to you. 'Cos you're the only one.. Who can turn me around when I'm upside down.. I turn to you.. . Where would I be? What would I do?. If you'd never helped me through.. I hope someday if you've lost your way.. You could turn to me like I turn to you.. . I turn to you. Like a flower leaning toward the sun.. I turn to you. 'Cos you're the only one.. Who can turn me around when I'm upside down.. I turn to you.. I turn to you. When fear tells me to turn around.. I turn to you. 'Cos you're the only one.. Who can turn me around when I'm upside down.. I turn to you. I turn to you.

Town (town). Party!Monday night and I feel so low. Count the hours they go so slow. I know the sound of your voice. Can save my soul. City lights, streets of gold. Look out my window to the world below. Moves so fast and it feels so cold. And I'm all alone. Don't let me die. I'm losing my mind. Baby just give me a sign. And now that you're gone. I just wanna be with you. And I can't go on. I wanna be with you. Wanna be with you. I can't sleep I'm up all night. Through these tears I try to smile. I know the touch of your hand. Can save my life. Don't let me down. Come to me now. I got to be with you some how. And now that you're gone. I just wanna be with you. And I can't go on. I wanna be with you. Wanna be with you. Don't let me down. Come to me now. I got to be with you somehow. And now that you're gone. Who am I with-out you now. I can't go on. I just wanna be with you. And now that you're gone.

Just wanna be with you. Just wanna be with youSomewhere there's speaking. It's already coming in. Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind. You never could get it. Unless you were fed it. Now you're here and you don't know why. But under skinned knees and the skid marks. Past the places where you used to learn. You howl and listen. Listen and wait for the. Echoes of angels who won't return. He's everything you want. He's everything you need. He's everything inside of you. That you wish you could be. He says all the right things. At exactly the right time. But he means nothing to you. And you don't know why. You're waiting for someone. To put you together. You're waiting for someone to push you away. There's always another wound to discover. There's always something more you wish he'd say. He's everything you want. He's everything you need. He's everything inside of you. That you wish you could be. He says all the right things. At exactly the right time. But he means nothing to you. And you don't know why. But you'll just sit tight. And watch it unwind. It's only what you're asking for. And you'll be just fine. With all of your time. It's only what you're waiting for. Out of the island. Into the highway. Past the places where you might have turned. You never did notice. But you still hide away. The anger of angels who won't return. I am everything you want. I am everything you need. I am everything inside of you. That you wish you could be. I say all the right things. At exactly the right time. But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why. And I don't know why. Why. I don't knowAn empty street, an empty house. A hole inside my heart. I'm all alone, the rooms are getting. smaller.. I wonder how, I wonder why, I wonder. where they are. The days we had, the songs we sang. together.(oh yeah). And all my love, I'm holding on forever. Reaching for the love that seems so far. So I say a little prayer. And hope my dreams will take me there. Where the skies are blue, to see you once. again... my love.. All the seas from coast to coast. To find the place I Love The Most. Where the fields are green, to see you. once again... my love.. I try to read, I go to work. I'm laughing with my friends. But I can't stop to keep myself from. thinking. (oh no). I wonder how, I wonder why, I wonder. where they are. The days we had, the songs we sang. together.(oh yeah). And all my love, I'm holding on forever. Reaching for the love that seems so far. So I say a little prayer. And hope my dreams will take me there. Where the skies are blue, to see you once. again... my love.. All the seas from coast to coast. To find the place I Love The Most. Where the fields are green, to see you. once again.... To hold you in my arms. To promise you my love. To tell you from the heart. You're all I'm thinking of. Reaching for the love that seems so far. So I say a little prayer. And hope my dreams will take its there. Where the skies are blue, to see you once. again... my love.. All the seas from coast to coast. To find the place I Love The Most. Where the fields are green, to see you. once again... my love.. Say it in a prayer (my sweet love). Dreams will take it there. Where the skies are blue (woah yeah), to. see you once again my love. (oh my love). All the seas from coast to coast. To find the place I Love The Most. Where the fields are green, to see you. once again...

Every time you're near baby I get kinda crazy. In my head for you and I don't know what to do. And I ohh baby I get kinda shaky. When they mention you I just lose my cool. My friends tell me something has come over me. And I think I know what it is. I think I'm in love.   (Boy, I think that I'm in love with you). (I've been doin' silly things when it comes to you). In love.   (Boy, I think that I'm in love with you). I think I'm in love.   (I've been tellin' all my friends what I feel for you). Just the other night baby I saw you hangin'. You were with your crew I was with mine too. You took me by surprise. When you turn and look me in my eyes. Boy you really blew my mind. I don't know what's gotten into me. But I kinda think I know what it is. I think I'm in love.   (Boy I think that I'm in love with you). In love.   (I've been doin' silly things when it comes to you). I'm in love.

(I've been doin silly things when it comes to you). I don't know what to do. Baby love.   (Boy I think I'm in love with you). I've been tellin all my friends what I feel for youI think I've already lost you. I think you're already gone. I think I'm finally scared now. You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong. I think you're already leaving. Feels like your hand is on the door. I thought this place was an empire. Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure. And I think you're so mean, I think we should try. I think I could need this in my life. And I think I'm scared, I think too much. I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing. If you're gone, maybe it's time to come home. There's an awful lot of breathing room but I can hardly move. If you're gone, baby you need to come home, come home. There's a little bit of something me an' everything in you. I bet you're hard to get over. I bet the room just won't shine. I bet my hands, I can stay here. And I bet you need more than your mind. And I think you're so mean, I think we should try. I think I could need this in my life. I think I'm just scared that I know too much. I can't relate and that's a problem I'm feeling. If you're gone, maybe it's time to come home. There's an awful lot of breathing room but I can hardly move. If you're gone, baby you need to come home, come home. There's a little bit of something me an' everything in you. I think you're so mean, I think we should try. I think I could need this in my life. And I think I'm scared, do I talk too much?. I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing. If you're gone, maybe it's time to come home. There's an awful lot of breathing room but I can hardly move. Now if you're gone, hell baby you need to come home, come home. There's a little bit of something me an' everything in you. Something me. Everything in. Something me and youBaby set me free from this misery. I can't take it no more. Since you ran away nothing's been the same. Don't know what I'm living for. Here I am so alone. And there's nothing in this world I can do. Until you're back here, baby. Miss you, want you, need you so. Until you're back here, baby, yeah. There's a feeling inside. I want you to know. You are the one. And I can't let you go. So I told you lies even made you cry. Baby I was so wrong. Girl, I promise you now my love is true. This is where my heart belongs. 'Cause here I am so alone. And there's nothing in this world I can do. Until you're back here, baby.

Yo, hot damn, Doc and Jam like a summer show. I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove. My gear look like the bank got my money froze. For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll. Doc the one that excite ya divas. If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up. Yo Christina, better hop in here. My block live and in color, like Rodman hair. The club is packed, the bar is filled. I'm waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill. Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals. I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels. Throw it up.

Like this. Everything changes but beauty remains. Something so tender. I can't explain. Well I may be dreaming. But till I awake. Can't we make this dream last forever?. And I'll cherish all the love we share. A moment like this. Some people wait a lifetime. For a moment like this. Some people search forever. For that one special kiss.

Just havin' one those days yea. Didn't know what to do. Then there was you. And everything went from wrong to right. And the stars came out to fill up the sky. The music you were playin' really blew my mind. It was love at first sight. 'Cause baby when I heard you. For the first time I knew. We were meant to be as one. I was tired of running out of luck. Thinkin' 'bout giving up, yea. Didn't know what to do. Then there was you. And everything went from wrong to right. And the stars came out to fill up the sky. The music you were playin' really blew my mind. It was love at first sight.   (Love). 'Cause baby when I heard you.   (When I heard). For the first time I knew. We were meant to be as one. (To be as one). 'Cause baby when I heard you. For the first time I knew. We were meant to be as one. Everythin' went from wrong to right. And the stars came out and filled up the sky.   (Up the sky). The music you were playin' really blew my mind. It was love at first sight.   (Love). Love at first sight. Love at first sight. Love. Ooh, it was love, it was love at first sight. 'Cause baby when I heard you.   (When I heard). For the first time I knew. We were meant to be as one. (To be as one). 'Cause baby when I heard you.   (When I heard). For the first time I knew. We were meant to be as one. It was love, it was love, it was love, it was love. Oohh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was love. Oohh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was loveIt's not her fault that she's so irresistible. But all the damage she's caused isn't fixable. Every twenty seconds you repeat her name. But when it comes to me you don't care. . Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal. That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible. But you gotta know small things also count. You better put your feet on the ground. And see what it's about. . So objection, I don't wanna be the exception. To get a bit of your attention. I love you for free and I'm not your mother. But you don't even bother. . Objection, I'm tired of this triangle. Got dizzy dancing tango. I'm falling apart in your hands again. No way, I've got to run away. . I wish you. (There was a chance for you and me). I wish. (You couldn't find a place to be). Away from here. . This is pathetic and sardonic, it's sadistic and psychotic. Tango is not for three, was never meant to be. But you can try it, rehearse it or train like a horse. But don't you count on me, don't you count on me boy. . So objection, I don't want to be the exception. To get a bit of your attention. I love you for free and I'm not your mother. But you don't even bother. . Objection, I'm tired of this triangle. Got dizzy dancing tango. I'm falling apart in your hands again. No way, I've got to get away. Get away, get away. Eh, eh, eh, get away. . I'm falling apart in your hands again.   (Get away). No way. I'm falling apart in your hands again.   (Get away). No way. I've got to get away.   (Get away)You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my love. You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my love. Here's how it goes, you and me up and down. But maybe this time we'll get it right, worth a fight. 'Cause love is something you can't shake. When it breaks all it takes is some tryin'. If you feel like leaving. I'm not gonna beg you to stay. 'Cause soon you'll be finding. You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my love. You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my love. So, if you go you should know. It's hard to just forget the past so fast. It was good, it was bad but it was real. And that's all you have in the end our love matters. If you feel like leaving. I'm not gonna beg you to stay. 'Cause soon you'll be finding. You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my love. You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my love. You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my love. You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my love. Here's how it goes. All it takes is some tryin'.   (Baby you can run). If you feel like leavin'. I'm not gonna beg you to stay. 'Cause soon you'll be finding. You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my love. If you feel like leavin'. Then I'm not gonna beg you to stay. 'Cause soon you'll be finding. You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my love. You can run, you can run. You can run, you can run.   (You can run). Baby, you can run, baby you can hide.   (You can run). But you can't escape my love.   (You can run). Baby, you can run, baby you can hide.   (You can run). But you can't escape my love. You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my love. You can run, you can hide. But you can't escape my loveLife is a mystery. Everyone must stand alone. I hear you call my name. And it feels like home. When you call my name, it's like a little prayer. I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there. In the midnight hour, I can feel your power. Just like a prayer you know, I'll take you there. I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing. I have no choice, I hear your voice, feels like flying. I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling. Out of the sky, I close my eyes, Heaven help me. When you call my name, it's like a little prayer. I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there. In the midnight hour, I can feel your power. Just like a prayer you know, I'll take you there. Like a child you whisper softly to me. You're in control just like a child, now I'm dancing. It's like a dream, no end and no beginning. You're here with me, it's like a dream, let the choir sing. Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there. Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery. Just like a dream, you are not what you seem. Just like a prayer, no choice, your voice can take me there. Just like a prayer, I'll take you there. It's like a dream to meAnd I was the kind of guy. Never let you look inside. I'd smile when I was cryin'. I had nothin' but a life to lose. Thought I had a lot to prove. In my life, there's no denyin'. Goodbye to all my yesterdays. They're gone. Goodbye, so long. And I've had enough of cryin'. Bleedin', sweatin', dyin'. I'm gonna live my life everyday. I'm gonna touch the sky. Spread these wings and fly. I'm gonna live my life everyday. Change, everybody's feelin' strange. Never gonna be the same. Makes you wonder how the world keeps turnin'. Life, I'm learnin' how to live my life. Learnin' how to pick my fights. Take my shots while I'm still burnin'. Goodbye to all those rainy nights. They're gone. Goodbye, so long. And I've had enough of cryin'. Bleedin', sweatin', dyin'. I'm gonna live my life everyday. I'm gonna touch the sky. I spread these wings and fly. I'm gonna live my life. Hit the gas, take the wheel. I've made myself a deal. Ain't nothin' gonna get in my way. Everyday. Goodbye to all my yesterdays. They're gone. And I've had enough of cryin'. Bleedin', sweatin', dyin'. I'm gonna live my life everyday. And I'm gonna touch the sky. Spread these wings and fly. I'm gonna live my life everyday. I. Oh I, oh I. Gonna live my life everyday.  And I. Oh I, oh I. Gonna live my life everydaySo you leavin' in the mornin'. On the early train. Well I could say, "Everything's all right". And I could pretend and say, "Goodbye". Got your ticket, got your suitcase. Got your leaving smile. Oh, I could say, "That's the way it goes". And I could pretend and you won't know that I was lying. 'Cause I can't stop loving you. No, I can't stop loving you. No, I won't stop loving you. Why should I?. We took a taxi to the station. Not a word was said. And I saw you walk across the road. For maybe the last time, I don't know. Feeling humble, heard a rumble. On the railway track. And when I hear the whistle blow. I'll walk away and you won't know that I'll be crying. 'Cause I can't stop loving you. No, I can't stop loving you. No, I won't stop loving you. Why should I?.   (Even try). I'll always be here by your side.   (Why, why, why?). I never wanted to say goodbye.   (Why even try?). I'm always here if you change, change your mind. So you leavin' in the mornin'. On the early train. Well I could say, "Everything's all right". And I could pretend and say, "Goodbye". But that would be lying. 'Cause I can't stop loving you. No, I can't stop loving you. No, I won't stop loving you. Why should I?. 'Cause I can't stop loving you. No, I can't stop loving you. No, I won't stop loving you. Why should I? Why should I?. Why should I even try?I need time (time). Love (love), joy (joy). I need space (love). I need me (action!). Say hello to the girl that I am. You're gonna have to see through my perspective. I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am. And I don't wanna be so damn protected. There must be another way. 'Cause I believe in taking chances. But who am I to say. What a girl is to do?. God, I need some answers. What am I to do with my life?. (You will find it out, don't worry). How am I supposed to know what's right?. (You just gotta do it your way). I can't help the way I feel. But my life has been so overprotected. I tell them what I like, what I want and what I don't. But every time I do, I stand corrected. Things that I've been told. I can't believe what I hear about the world. I realize I'm overprotected. There must be another way. 'Cause I believe in taking chances. But who am I to say. What a girl is to do?. God, I need some answers. What am I to do with my life?. (You will find it out, don't worry). How am I supposed to know what's right?. (You just gotta do it your way). I can't help the way I feel. But my life has been so overprotected. I need time (love). I need space. (This is it, this is it). I don't need nobody tellin' me just what I wanna. What I, what-what, what I'm gonna (I need). Do about my destiny. I say no-no, nobody's telling me just what I wanna do-do. I'm so fed up with people telling me to be. Someone else but me (action!). What am I to do with my life?. (You will find it out, don't worry). How am I supposed to know what's right?. (You just gotta do it your way). I can't help the way I feel. But my life has been so overprotected. I don't need nobody tellin' me just what I wanna. What I, what-what, what I'm gonna. Do about my destiny. I say no-no, nobody's telling me just what I wanna do-do. I'm so fed up with people tellin' me to be. Someone else but me. What am I to do with my life?. (You will find it out, don't worry). How am I supposed to know what's right?. (You just gotta do it your way). I can't help the way I feel. But my life has been so overprotectedTook my hands. Touched my heart. Held me close. You were always there. By my side. Night and day. Through it all. Baby come what may. Swept away on a wave of emotion. Oh we're caught in the eye of the storm. And, whenever you smile. I can hardly believe that you're mine. Believe that you're mine. This love is unbreakable. It's unmistakable. And each time I look in your eyes. I know why. This love is untouchable. A feeling my heart just can't deny. Each time I look in your eyes. Oh baby, I know why. This love is unbreakable. Shared the laughter. Shared the tears. We both know. We'll go on from here. 'Cause together. We are strong. In my arms. That's where you belong. I've been touched by the hands of an angel. I've been blessed by the power of love. And whenever you smile. I can hardly believe that you're mine. Believe that you're mine. This love is unbreakable. It's unmistakable. Each time I look in your eyes. I know why. This love is untouchable. A feeling my heart just can't deny. Each time you whisper my name. Oh baby, I know why. This love is unbreakable. Through fire and flame. When all this is over. Our love still remains. This love is unbreakable. It's unmistakable. Each time I look in your eyes. I know why. This love is untouchable. A feeling my heart just can't deny. Each time you whisper my name. Oh baby, I know why. 'Cos each time I look in your eyes. Oh baby, I know why. This love is unbreakableOh yes. Yes I did baby, yes I did. It's funny 'cause for a while I walked around with a smile. But deep inside I could hear voices telling me this ain't right. Don't you know it's not for you? I always knew what I had to do. But it's hard to get away 'cause I love you, I just tried to stay. I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it. After telling everybody that I wasn't with it. Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it. And I know inside I'ma be alright. I said I couldn't do it but I did it. After telling everybody that I wasn't with it. Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it. And that voice inside says, "I'm gonna be alright". Friends of mine say to me, they say you got control over me. You're not alone, I played my part, I saw the way you were from the start. Could I expect so much from you? You had a girl when I first met you. Did the best that you could do, now I realize that I can't change you. I used to say, I couldn't do it but I did it. After telling everybody that I wasn't with it. Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it. And I know inside I'ma be alright. I said I couldn't do it but I did it. After telling everybody that I wasn't with it. Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it. And that voice inside says, "I'm gonna be alright". Said, "I wouldn't walk away", somedays I want to stay. But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay. Never thought it would be true, me livin' without you. But now it's time for me to make that move, oh. I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it. After telling everybody that I wasn't with it. Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it. And I know inside I'ma be alright. I said I couldn't do it but I did it. After telling everybody that I wasn't with it. Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it. And that voice inside says, "I'm gonna be alright". I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it. After telling everybody that I wasn't with it. Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it.

And I know inside I'ma be alright. I said I couldn't do it but I did it. After telling everybody that I wasn't with it. Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it.

OOH, before you walk out that door listen. They say two wrongs don't make a right. Don't make it right. So if I'm wrong, I ain't tryna fight. I'm tryna have some dinner wit some candlelight.

You should take what I take. You should feel what I feel. You should take what I takeFor so many years we were friends. And yes, I always knew what we could do. But so many tears in the rain. Felt the night you said. That love had come to you. I thought you were not my kind. I thought that I could never feel for you. The passion and love you were feeling. And so you left for someone new. And now that you're far and away. I'm sending a letter today. From Sarah with love. She'd got the lover she is dreaming of. She never found the words to say. But I know that today. She's gonna send her letter to you. From Sarah with love. She took your picture to the stars above. And they told her it is true. She could dare to fall in love with you. So don't make her blue when she writes to you. From Sarah with love. So maybe the chance for romance. Is like a train to catch before it's gone. Maybe it's just an illusion to hold behind. The clouds you'll find the sun. But I'll keep on hoping and praying. There will be a day when we meet again. And I'll keep on waiting and dreaming. You're strong enough to understand. As long as you're so far away. I'm sending a letter each day. From Sarah with love. She'd got the lover she is dreaming of. She never found the words to say. But I know that today. She's gonna send her letter to you. From Sarah with love. She took your picture to the stars above. And they told her it is true. She could dare to fall in love with you. So don't make her blue when she writes to you. From Sarah with love. From Sarah with love. She'd got the lover she is dreaming of. She never found the words to say. But I know that today. She's gonna send her letter to you. From Sarah with love. She's gotta know what you are thinking of. 'Cause every little now and then. And again and again. I know her heart cries out for you. From Sarah with love. She'd got the lover she is dreaming of. Never found the words to say, ahh. But today, but today. From Sarah with love. She took your picture to the stars above. And they told her it is true. She could dare to fall in love with you. So don't make her blue when she writes to you. From Sarah with love. And they told her it is true. She could dare to fall in love with you. So don't make me blue when I write to you. From Sarah with loveWhat's wrong with the world, mama. People livin' like they ain't got no mamas. I think the whole world's addicted to the drama. Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma. Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism. But we still got terrorists here livin'. In the USA, the big CIA. The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK. But if you only have love for your own race. Then you only leave space to discriminate. And to discriminate only generates hate. And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah. Madness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how anger works and operates. Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight. Take control of your mind and meditate. Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach?. Or would you turn the other cheek?. Father, Father, Father help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love, the love, the love. It just ain't the same, all ways are changed. New days are strange, is the world insane?. If love and peace is so strong. Why are there pieces of love that don't belong. Nations droppin' bombs. Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones. With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young. So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone. So I can ask myself really what is goin' wrong. In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in. Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends. Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother. A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover. The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug. If you never know truth then you never know love. Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the love, y'all(come on yeah). People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach. Or would you turn the other cheek. Father, Father, Father help us. Send us some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love, the love, the love. I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder. As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder. Most of us only care about money makin'. Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction. Wrong information always shown by the media. Negative images, is the main criteria. Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria. Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas. Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity. Whatever happened to the fairness and equality. Instead in spreading love we're spreading animosity. Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down. There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under. Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found (now ask yourself). Where is the love. Where is the love. Where is the love. Where is the love. Father, Father, Father help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love. Sing with my ya'll. (One world, one world). We only got. (One world, one world). That's all we got. (One world, one world). And somethin's wrong wit it. (Yeah). Somethin's wrong wit it. (Yeah). Somethin's wrong with the w-w-world yeah. We only got. (One world, one world). That's all we got. (One world, one world)Tatu. Miscellaneous. All The Things She Said. All the things she said.

Come in over my face, wash away all the shame. When they stop and stare - don't worry me. 'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me. I can try to pretend, I can try to forget. But it's driving me mad, going out of my head. . Mother looking at me. Tell me what do you see?. Yes, I've lost my mind. . Daddy looking at me. Will I ever be free?. Have I crossed the line?NADon't look at me. Every day is so wonderful. And suddenly it's hard to breathe. Now and then I get insecure. From all the pain, feel so ashamed.

Dance with me:Do I have to change my name?. Will it get me far?. Should I lose some weight?. Am I gonna be a star?. I tried to be a boy,. I tried to be a girl. I tried to be a mess,. I tried to be the best. I guess I did it wrong,. That's why I wrote this song. This type of modern life - Is it for me?. This type of modern life - Is it for free?. So, I went into a bar looking for sympathy. A little company - I tried to find a friend. It's more easily said it's always been the same. This type of modern life -Is not for me?. This type of modern life -Is not for free?. American life. I live the american dream. You are the best thing I've seen,. You are not just a dream. I tried to stay ahead,. I tried to stay on top. I tried to play the part,. But somehow I forgot. Just what I did it for. And why I wanted more. This type of modern life - Is it for me?. This type of modern life - Is it for free?. Do I have to change my name?. Will it get me far?. Should I lose some weight?. Am I gonna be a star?. American life. I live the american dream. You are the best thing I've seen,. You are not just a dream. I tried to be a boy,. I tried to be a girl. I tried to be a mess,. I tried to be the best. I tried to find a friend,. I tried to stay ahead. I tried to stay on top.... Fuck it.... Do I have to change my name?. Will it get me far?. Should I lose some weight?. Am I gonna be a star?. I'm drinking a Soy latte. I get a double shot. It goes right through my body. And you know. I'm satisfied,. I drive my mini cooper. And I'm feeling super-dooper. Yo they tell I'm a trooper. And you know I'm satisfied. I do yoga and pilates. And the room is full of hotties. So I'm checking out the bodies. And you know I'm satisfied. I'm digging on the isotopes. This metaphysic's shit is dope. And if all this can give me hope. You know I'm satisfied. I got a lawyer and a manager. An agent and a chef. Three nannies, an assistant. And a driver and a jet. A trainer and a butler. And a bodyguard or five. A gardener and a stylist. Do you think I'm satisfied?. I'd like to express my extreme point of view. I'm not Christian and I'm not a Jew. I'm just living out the American dream. And I just realized that nothing Is what it seems. Do I have to change my name. Am I gonna be a star. Do I have to change my name. Am I gonna be a star?. Do I have to change my nameYou were my sun. You were my earth. But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no. So you took a chance. And made other plans. But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no. You don't have to say, what you did,. I already know, I found out from him. Now there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be. And don't it make you sad about it. You told me you loved me. Why did you leave me, all alone. Now you tell me you need me. When you call me, on the phone. Girl I refuse, you must have me confused. With some other guy.

Uh Huh (woman). Uh Huh (Man). Uh Huh (Woman). Uh Huh (Man). Uh Huh (Woman). Uh Huh (Man). Who's Who's this?How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable. So condescending, unnecessarily critical. I have the tendency of getting very physical. So watch your step cause if I do you'll need a miracle. You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here. This double vision I was seeing is finally clear. You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone. Not fit to ' tread the ground that I am walking on. When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love. You'll understand what I mean when I say. There's no way we're gonna give up. And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head. You should know better you never listened to a word I said. Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat. Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did. When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love. You'll understand what I mean when I say. There's no way we're gonna give up. And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. Does it kill. Does it burn. Is it painful to learn. That it's me that has all the control. Does it thrill. Does it sting. When you feel what I bring. And you wish that you had me to hold. When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love. You'll understand what I mean when I say. There's no way we're gonna give up. And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breatheDoing everything that I believe in. Going by the rules that I've been taught. More understanding of what's around me. And protected from the walls of love. All that you see is me. And all I truly believe. That I was born to try. I've learned to love. Be understanding. And believe in life. But you've got to make choices. Be wrong or right. Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like. But I was born to try. No point in talking what you should have been. And regretting the things that went on. Life's full of mistakes, destinies and fate. Remove the clouds look at the bigger picture. And all that you see is me. And all I truly believe. That I was born to try. I've learned to love. Be understanding. And believe in life. But you've got to make choices. Be wrong or right. Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like. But I was born to try. All that you see is me. All I truly believe. All that you see is me. And all I truly believe. That I was born to try. I've learned to love. Be understanding. And believe in life. But you've got to make choices. Be wrong or right. Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like. But I was born to try. But you've got to make choices. Be wrong or right. Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like. But I was born to tryI'm here. Just like I said. Though its breaking every rule I've ever made. My racin' heart. Is just the same. Why make it strong to break it once again?. And I'd love to say I do. Give everything to you. But I can never now be true. So I say. I think I'd better leave right now. Before I fall any deeper. I think I'd better leave right now. Feelin' weaker and weaker. Somebody better show me out. Before I fall any deeper. I think I'd better leave right now. I'm here. So please explain. Why you're openin' up a healin' wound again. I'm a little more careful. Perhaps it shows. But if I lose the highs, at least I'm spared the lows. Now I tremble in your arms. What could be the harm. To feel my spirit calm. So I say. I think I'd better leave right now. Before I fall any deeper. I think I'd better leave right now. I'm feelin' weaker and weaker. Somebody better show me out. Before I fall any deeper. I think I'd better leave right now. I wouldn't know how to say. How good it feels seeing you today. I see you've got your smile back. Now you say your right on track. But you may never know why. Once bitten twice is shy. If I'm proud perhaps I should explain. I couldn't bear to lose you again. I think I'd better leave right now. Before I fall any deeper. I think I'd better leave right now. Feelin' weaker and weaker. Somebody better show me out. Before I fall any deeper. I think I'd better leave right now. Yes I will. I think I'd better leave right now. I'm feelin' weaker and weaker. Somebody better show me out. Before I fall any deeper. I think I'd better leave right nowWhen you're weary. Feeling small. When tears are in your eyes. I will dry them all. I'm on your side. Oh when times get rough. And friends just can't be found. Like a bridge over troubled water. I will lay me down. Like a bridge over troubled water. I will lay me down. When you're down and out. When you're on the street. When evening falls so hard. I will comfort you. I'll take your part. When darkness comes. And pain is all around. Like a bridge over troubled water. I will lay me down. Like a bridge over troubled water. I will lay me down. Sail on Silver Girl,. Sail on by. Your time has come to shine. All your dreams are on their way. See how they shine. oh if you need a friend. Look around. I'm sailing right behind. Like a bridge over troubled water. I will ease your mind. Oh like a bridge over troubled water. I will ease your mind. Ease your mindBaby, when I think about the day that we first met. (The day that we first met). Wasn't lookin' for what I found but I found you. And I'm bound to find happiness in being around you. I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you. I'm glad for the way you make me feel. I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind everytime. I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand.

Losin' my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round. Do you feel me now?. With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride. You're toxic, I'm slippin' under. With a taste of a poison paradise. I'm addicted to you. Don't you know that you're toxic?. And I love what you do. Don't you know that you're toxic?. It's getting late. To give you up. I took a sip. From my devil's cup. Slowly, it's taking over me.

Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane. Never to return again but always in my heart, oh. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breakin' in front of me. And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I tried my best to feed her appetite. Keep her coming every night. So hard to keep her satisfied, oh. Kept playing love like it was just a game. Pretending to feel the same. Then turn around and leave again, but uh-oh. This love has taken its toll on me. She said goodbye too many times before. And her heart is breakin' in front of me. And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings. And make sure everything's all right. (It's all right, it's all right). My pressure on your hips, I'm sinking my fingertips into.

I love you, is that okay?It's Christmas time there's no need to be afraid At Christmas time – we let in light and we banish shade And in our world of plenty we can spread our smile of joy. Feel your arms around the world at Christmas time. But say a prayer and pray for the other ones. At Christmas time its hard but while you're having fun. There's a world outside your window and it's a world of dread and fear. Where a kiss of love can kill you. Where there's death in every tear. And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom. Well tonight we're reaching out and touching you. Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa. A song of hope where there's no hope tonight (ooh). Why is comfort to be feared, Why is to touch to be scared. How can they know it's Christmas time at all. Here's to you. Raise a glass to everyone. Here's to them. And all there is to come. Can they know it's Christmas time at all. Feed the world let them know it's Christmas time again. Feel the world let them know it's Christmas time again. Heal the world let them know it's Christmas time again. Feed the world let them know it's Christmas time again. Feel the world let them know it's Christmas time again. Heal the world let them know it's Christmas time again. Feed the world let them know it's Christmas time again. Feel the world let them know it's Christmas time againAll my life I've been waiting.

I was a stitched up by the hands of fate. Said, "How you gonna make it on your own?". If luck is a lady, maybe luck is a lady. I was going down for the third time. My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions. Had so many questions that you just kissed away. Tell me, I guess that Cupid was in disguise. The day you walked in and changed my life. I think it's amazing the way that love can set you free. So now I walk in the midday sun. I never thought that my savior would come. I think it's amazing, I think it's amazing. I think you're amazing. You tried to save me from myself. Said, "Darling, kiss as many as you want. My love's still available and I know you're insatiable". We're like a victims of the same disease. Look at your Big Bad Daddy and your mom. And your mom was always acting crazy. I was going down for the third time. My heart was broken, I thought that loving you was out of the question. Then I saw my reflection, saying, "Please don't let this go". Tell me, I guess that Cupid was in disguise. The day you walked in and changed my life. I think it's amazing the way that love can set you free. So now I walk in the midday sun. I never thought that my savior would come. I think it's amazing, I think you're amazing. Celebrate, this life with you, baby. I think you should celebrate, yeah. Don't put your love in chains, baby. No, no, no, walk in the midday sun. I thought I was dreaming, I think it's amazing. I think you're amazing. Celebrate, celebrate. As this life gets colder. And the Devil inside. It tells you to give upDo you ever feel like breaking down. Do you ever feel out of place. Like somehow you just don't belong. And no one understands you. Do you ever wanna run away. Do you lock yourself in your room. With the radio on, turned up so loud. That no one hears you screaming. No you don't know what it's like. When nothing feels allright. No you don't know what it's like. To be like me. To be hurt. To feel lost. To be left out in the dark. To be kicked. When you're down. To feel like you've been pushed around. To be on the edge of breaking down. And no one's there to save you. No you don't know what it's like. Welcome to my life. Do you wanna be somebody else. Are you sick of being so left out. Are you desperate to find something more. Before your life is over. Are you stuck inside a world you hate. Are you sick of everyone around.

So tell me when you're gonna let me in. I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin. I came across a fallen tree. I felt the branches of it looking at me. Is this the place we used to love?. Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?. Oh simple thing where have you gone?. I'm getting old and I need something to rely on. So tell me when you're gonna let me in. I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin. And if you have a minute why don't we go. Talk about it somewhere only we know?. This could be the end of everything. So why don't we go?. Somewhere only we know?. Somewhere only we know?. Oh simple thing where have you gone?. I'm getting old and I need something to rely on. So tell me when you're gonna let me in. I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin. And if you have a minute why don't we go?. Talk about it somewhere only we know. This could be the end of everything. So why don't we go? So why don't we go?. This could be the end of everything. So why don't we go? Somewhere only we know. Somewhere only we know. Somewhere only we knowPaint my face in your magazines. Make it look whiter than it seems. Paint me over with your dreams. Shove away my ethnicity. Burn every notion that I may have a flame inside to fight. And say just what is on my mind. Without offending your might. 'Cause this life is too short to live it just for you. But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do?. So say what you want, say what you want. I saw her face outside today. Weather worn, looking all the rage. They took her passion and her gaze and made a poster. Now it's moccasins we sport. We take the culture and contort. Perhaps only to distort what we are hiding. 'Cause this life is too short to live it just for you. But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do?. But say what you want, say what you want. Hey you, the one the one outside, are you gonna get in, get in. Hey you, the one that don't fit in, how ya, how ya gonna get in. Hey you, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in with your. Broken teeth, broken jaw, broken mojo. Yeah, this life is too short to live it just for you. But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?. 'Cause this life is too short to live it just for you. But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?I remember all my life. Raining down as cold as ice. shadows of a man. A face through a window. Crying in the night. The night goes into. Morning, just another day. Happy people pass my way. Looking in their eyes. I see a memory. I never realized. how happy you made me oh Mandy. Well you came and you gave without taking. but I sent you away, oh Mandy. well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you today, oh Mandy. I'm standing on the edge of time. I've walked away when love was mine. Caught up in a world of uphill climbing. The tears are in my mind. And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy. Well you came and you gave without taking. but I sent you away, oh Mandy. well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you today, oh Mandy. Yesterday's a dream I face the morning. Crying on a breeze. the pain is calling, oh Mandy. Well you came and you gave without taking. but I sent you away, oh Mandy. well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you today, oh Mandy. You came and you gave without taking. but I sent you away, oh Mandy. You kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you. Oh Mandy won't you listen to what I've got to say. Oh baby don't you let me throw it all away. Oh Mandy won't you listen to what I've got to say. and I need you today oh Mandy...When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary. When troubles come and my heart burdened be. Then I am still and wait here in the silence. Until you come and sit awhile with me. You raise me up so I can stand on mountains. You raise me up to walk on stormy seas. I am strong when I am on your shoulders. You raise me up to more than I can be. You raise me up so I can stand on mountains. You raise me up to walk on stormy seas. I am strong when I am on your shoulders. You raise me up to more than I can be. You raise me up so I can stand on mountains. You raise me up to walk on stormy seas. I am strong when I am on your shoulders. You raise me up to more than I can be. You raise me up so I can stand on mountains. You raise me up to walk on stormy seas. I am strong when I am on your shoulders. You raise me up to more than I can be. You raise me up to more than I can beWatching every motion in my foolish lover's game. On this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame. Turnin' and returnin' to some secret place inside. Watchin' in slow motion as you turn around and say, "My love. Take my breath away. Take my breath away". Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love. Never hesitating to become the fated ones, oh yeah. Turnin' and returnin' to some secret place inside. Watchin' in slow motion as you turn around and say, "My love. Take my breath away. Take my breath away, oh yeah". Through the hourglass I saw you. In time you slipped away. When the mirror crashed I called you. And turned to hear you say. â€½If only for today I am unafraidâ€. Take my breath away. You take my breath away.   (Take my breath away). You take my breath. You take my breath. You take my breath away.   (Take my breath away). You take my breath away.

She was with another man. But I won't lose no sleep on that. 'Cause I've got a plan. You're beautiful, you're beautiful. You're beautiful, it's true. I saw your face in a crowded place. And I don't know what to do. 'Cause I'll never be with you. Yes, she caught my eye. As we walked on by. She could see from my face that I was fucking high. And I don't think that I'll see her again but. We shared a moment that will last 'till the end. You're beautiful, you're beautiful. You're beautiful, it's true. I saw your face in a crowded place. And I don't know what to do. 'Cause I'll never be with you. You're beautiful, you're beautiful. You're beautiful, it's true. There must be an angel with a smile on her face. When she thought up that I should be with you. But it's time to face the truth. I will never be with youI didn't mean it when I said. I didn't love you so. I should have held on tight. I never should have let you go. I didn't know nothing. I was stupid, I was foolish. I was lying to myself. I couldn't have fathomed. I would ever be without your love. Never imagined I'd be sitting. Here beside myself. Guess I didn't know you. Guess I didn't know me. But I thought I knew everything. I never felt. The feeling that I'm feeling. Now that I don't hear your voice. Or have your touch and kiss your lips. 'Cause I don't have a choice. Oh what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side. Right here,'cause baby. When you left I lost a part of me. It's still so hard to believe. Come back, baby, please,'cause. We belong together. Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough. Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up. Who's gonna take your place. There ain't nobody better. Oh baby baby. We belong together. I can't sleep at night. When you are on my mind. Bobby Womack's on the radio. Singing to me. "If you think you're lonely now". Wait a minute, this is too deep(too deep). I gotta change the station. So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break. And then I hear Babyface. "I only think of you". And its' breakin' my heart. I'm tryin' to keep it together. But I'm falling apart. I'm feeling all out of my element. Throwing things, crying tryin'. To figure out where the hell I went wrong. The pain reflected in this song. Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside. I need you, need you back in my life baby. When you left I lost a part of me. It's still so hard to believe. Come back, baby, please,'cause. We belong together. Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough. Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up. Who's gonna take your place. There ain't nobody better. Oh baby baby. We belong together. When you left I lost a part of me. It's still so hard to believe. Come back, baby, please,'cause. We belong together.

Hoy sÃ© que tÃº ya no me quieres. Y eso es lo que mÃ¡s me hiere. Que tengo la camisa negra. Y una pena que me duele. Mal parece que solo me quedÃ©. Y fue pura todita tu mentira. Que maldita mala suerte la mÃ­a. Que aquel dÃ­a te encontrÃ©. Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor. Yo quedÃ© moribundo y lleno de dolor. RespirÃ© de ese humo amargo de tu adiÃ³s. Y desde que tÃº te fuiste yo solo tengo. Tengo la camisa negra. Porque negra tengo el alma. Yo por ti perdÃ­ la calma. Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama. Cama cama caman baby. Te digo con disimulo. Que tengo la camisa negra. Y debajo tengo el difunto. Tengo la camisa negra. Ya tu amor no me interesa. Lo que ayer me supo a gloria. Hoy me sabe a pura. MiÃ©rcoles por la tarde y tÃº que no llegas. Ni siquiera muestras seÃ±as. Y yo con la camisa negra. Y tus maletas en la puerta. Mal parece que solo me quedÃ©. Y fue pura todita tu mentira. Que maldita mala suerte la mÃ­a. Que aquel dÃ­a te encontrÃ©. Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor. Yo quedÃ© moribundo y lleno de dolor. RespirÃ© de ese humo amargo de tu adiÃ³s. Y desde que tÃº te fuiste yo solo tengo. Tengo la camisa negra. Porque negra tengo el alma. Yo por ti perdÃ­ la calma. Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama. Cama, cama, caman, baby. Te digo con disimulo. Que tengo la camisa negra.

In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air. I was born too late to a world that doesn't care. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. When the head of state didn't play guitar. Not everybody drove a car. When music really mattered and when radio was king. When accountants didn't have control. And the media couldn't buy your soul. And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air. I was born too late to a world that doesn't care. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. When pop stars still remained a myth. And ignorance could still be bliss. And when God Save the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale. When my mom and dad were in their teens. And anarchy was still a dream. And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air. I was born too late to a world that doesn't care. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. When record shops were on top. And vinyl was all that they stocked. And the super info-highway was still drifting out in space. Kids were wearing hand-me-downs. And playing games meant kick arounds. And footballers who had long hair and dirt across their face. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air. I was born too late to a world that doesn't care. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. I was born too late to a world that doesn't care.

Trying hard to reach out. But when I'd try to speak out. Felt like no one could hear me. Wanted to belong here. But something felt so wrong here. So I pray. I could breakaway. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. I'll do what it takes til I touch the sky. And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change. And breakaway. Out of the darkness and into the sun. But I won't forget all the ones that I loved. I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And breakaway. Wanna feel the warm breeze. Sleep under a palm tree. Feel the rush of the ocean. Get onboard a fast train. Travel on a jet plane, far away. And breakaway. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky. And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change. And breakaway. Out of the darkness and into the sun. I won't forget all the ones that I loved. I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And breakaway. Buildings with a hundred floors. Swinging 'round revolving doors. Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but. Gotta keep moving on, moving on. Fly away, breakaway. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye. I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And breakaway. Out of the darkness and into the sun.

'Cause I want you. And I feel you. Crawling underneath my skin. Like a hunger. Like a burning. To find a place I've never been. Now I'm broken. And I'm fading. I'm half the man I thought I would be:. But you can have what's left of me. I've been dying inside. Little by little. No where to go. But going out of my mind. In endless circles. Running from myself until. You gave me a reason for standing still. And I want you. And I feel you. Crawling underneath my skin. Like a hunger. Like a burning. To find a place I've never been. Now I'm broken. And I'm fading. I'm half the man I thought I would be:. But you can have what's left of me. Falling faster. Barely breathing. Give me something. To believe in. Tell me: It's not all in my head. Take what's left. Of this man. Make me whole. Once again. 'Cause I want you. And I feel you. Crawling underneath my skin. A hunger. Like a burning. To find a place I've never been. Now I'm broken. And I'm fading.

You play forgiveness. Watch it now- here he comes. He doesn't look a thing like Jesus. But he talks like a gentlemen. Like you imagined when you were young. Can we climb this mountain. I don't know. Higher now than ever before. I know we can make it if we take it slow. Let's take it easy. Easy now, watch it go. We're burning down the highway skyline. On the back of a hurricane that started turning. When you were young. When you were young. And sometimes you close your eyes. and see the place where you Used to live. When you were young. They say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet. You don't have to drink right now. But you can dip your feet. Every once in a little while. You sit there in your heartache. Waiting on some beautiful boy. To save you from your old ways. You play forgiveness. Watch it now- here he comes. He doesn't look a thing like Jesus. But he talks like a gentlemen. Like you imagined when you were young. When you were young. I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus. He doesn't look a thing like Jesus. But more than you'll ever knowDid I disappoint you or let you down?. Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?. 'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,. Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.. So I took what's mine by eternal right.. Took your soul out into the night.. It may be over but it won't stop there,. I am here for you if you'd only care.. You touched my heart you touched my soul.. You changed my life and all my goals.. And love is blind and that I knew when,. My heart was blinded by you.. I've kissed your lips and held your head.. Shared your dreams and shared your bed.. I know you well, I know your smell.. I've been addicted to you.. Goodbye my lover.. Goodbye my friend.. You have been the one.. You have been the one for me.. I am a dreamer but when I wake,. You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.. And as you move on, remember me,. Remember us and all we used to be. I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.. I've watched you sleeping for a while.. I'd be the father of your child.. I'd spend a lifetime with you.. I know your fears and you know mine.. We've had our doubts but now we're fine,. And I love you, I swear that's true.. I cannot live without you.. Goodbye my lover.. Goodbye my friend.. You have been the one.. You have been the one for me.. And I still hold your hand in mine.. In mine when I'm asleep.. And I will bear my soul in time,. When I'm kneeling at your feet.. Goodbye my lover.. Goodbye my friend.. You have been the one.. You have been the one for me.. I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.. I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.There's only so much you can learn in one place. The more that I wait, the more time that I waste. . I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way.

Let me paint this picture for you, baby. Yo. You spend your nights alone. And he never comes home. And every time you call him. All you get's a busy tone. I heard you found out. That he's doing to you. What you did to me. Ain't that the way it goes. When you cheated girl. My heart bleeded girl. So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt. Just a classic case. A scenario. Tale as old as time. Girl you got what you deserved. And now you want somebody. To cure the lonely nights. You wish you had somebody. That could come and make it right. But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy. You'll see. (What goes around comes back around). I thought I told ya, hey. (What goes around comes back around). I thought I told ya, hey. (What goes around comes back around). I thought I told ya, hey. (What goes around comes back around). I thought I told ya, hey. (laughs). See?. You should've listened to me, baby. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.... Hey girl. Because. (What goes around comes back around). (laughs)Will you count me in?. I've been awake for a while now. You got me feelin' like a child now. 'Cause every time I see your bubbly face.... I get "the tinglies" in a silly place. It starts in my toes. And I crinkle my nose. Wherever it goes. I always know. That you make me smile. Please stay for a while now. Just take your time. Wherever you go. The rain is fallin' on my window pane. But we are hidin' in a safer place. Under cover stayin' dry and warm. You give me feelings that I adore. They start in my toes. Make me crinkle my nose. Wherever it goes. I always know. That you make me smile. Please stay for a while now. Just take your time. Wherever you go. But what am I gonna say. When you make me feel this way?. I just... mmmmm.... And it starts in my toes. Makes me crinkle my nose. Wherever it goes. I always know. That you make me smile. Please stay for a while now. Just take your time. Wherever you go. I've been asleep for a while now. You tuck me in just like a child now. 'Cause every time you hold me in your arms. I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth. It starts in my soul. And I lose all control. When you kiss my nose. The feelin' shows. Cause you make me smile. Baby, just take your time now. Holdin' me ti-i-ight. Wherever, wherever, wherever you go. Wherever, wherever, wherever you go. Oh, wherever you go. I always know. 'Cause you make me smile. Even just for a whileI wake up with blood-shot eyes. Struggled to memorize. The way it felt between your thighs. Pleasure that made you cry. Feels so good to be bad. Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that. Try to get you back. I still don't have a reason. And you don't have the time. And it really makes me wonder. If I ever gave a fuck about you. Give me something to believe in. Cause I don't believe in you. Anymore, anymore. I wonder if it even makes a difference to try. Yeah, so this is goodbye. God damn, my spinning head. Decisions that made my bed. Now I must lay in it. And deal with things I left unsaid. I want to dive into you. What you're going through. I get behind, make your move. Forget about the truth. I still don't have the reason. And you don't have the time. And it really makes me wonder. If I ever gave a fuck about you. Give me something to believe in. Cause I don't believe in you. Anymore, anymore. I wonder if it even makes a difference. it even makes a difference to try. Yeah. And you told me how you're feeling. But I don't believe it's true. Anymore, anymore. I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry. (Although). So this is goodbye. I've been here before. One day I'll wake up. And it won't hurt anymore. You caught me in a lie. I have no alibi. The words you say don't have a meaning. Cause I, still don't have a reason. And you don't have the time. And it really makes me wonder. If I ever gave a fuck about you and I. And so this is goodbye. Give me something to believe in. Cause I don't believe in you. Anymore, anymore. I wonder if it even makes a difference. It even makes a difference to try. Yeah. And you told me how you're feeling. But I don't believe it's true. Anymore, anymore. I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry. So this is goodbye. So this is goodbye. Yeah, so this is goodbye. Yeah, so this is goodbye[Spoken].

Feels like no one else in the room (but you). [Bridge:]. We can get down like there's no one around. We keep on rocking, we keep on rockin'. Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing. They keep watching, keep watchin'. Feels like the the crowd was saying. [Chorus:]. Gimme Gimme more. Gimme more. Gimme gimme more [x4]. The center of attention, even when we're up against the wall.

I never thought I'd, I need you there when I cry. And the days feel like years when I'm alone. And the bed where you lie is made up on your side. When you walk away I count the steps that you take. Do you see how much I need you right now?. When you're gone. The pieces of my heart are missing you. When you're gone. The face I came to know is missing too. When you're gone. All the words I need to hear. To always get me through the day. And make it okay. I miss you. I've never felt this way before. Everything that I do reminds me of you. And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor. And they smell just like you. I love the things that you do. When you walk away I count the steps that you take. Do you see how much I need you right now?. When you're gone. The pieces of my heart are missing you. And when you're gone. The face I came to know is missing too. And when you're gone.

Could you tell. By the flames that burned your words. I never read your letter. 'Cos I knew what you'd say. Give me that Sunday school answer. Try and make it all OK. Does it hurt. To know I'll never be there. Bet it sucks. To see my face everywhere. It was you. Who chose to end it like you did. I was the last to know. You knew, exactly what you would do. And don't say, you simply lost your way. She may believe you but I never will. Never again. If she really knows the truth. She deserves you. A trophy wife, oh how cute. Ignorance is bliss. But when your day comes. And he's through with you. And he'll be through with you. You'll die together but alone. You wrote me in a letter. You couldn't say it right to my face. Give me that Sunday school answer. Repent yourself away. Does it hurt. To know I'll never be there. Bet it sucks. To see my face everywhere. It was you. Who chose to end it like you did. I was the last to know. You knew, exactly what you would do. And don't say, you simply lost your way. They may believe you but I never will. Never again. Never again will I hear you. Never again will I miss you. Never again will I fall to you. Never. Never again will I kiss you. Never again will I want to. Never again will I love you. Never. Does it hurt.

And don't say, you simply lost your way. They may believe you but I never will. I never will. I never will. Never againDo you know?. Do you know?. Do you know?. Do you know what it feels like loving someone. That's in a rush to throw you away?.   (Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?). Do you know what it feels like to be the last one. To know the lock on the door has changed.   (Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?). If birds flying south's a sign of changes. At least you can predict this every year. Love, you never know the minute it ends. Suddenly I can't get it to speak. Maybe find you all the things it took to save us. I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me. Look in your eyes 'til I see there's something about me. I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give. Do you know what it feels like loving someone. That's in a rush to throw you away?.   (Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?). Do you know what it feels like to be the last one. To know the lock on the door has changed.   (Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?). How can I love you? How can I love you?. How can I love you? How can I love you?. If you just don't talk to me, babe.

Ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero. Ayer tÃº me juraste que este amor serÃ­a eterno. Por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente. Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente. Â¿Que hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza. Hoy empaÃ±aste con tu furia mi mirada. Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia. Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba. Con un permiso para asi romperme el alma. Â¿Que hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas. Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras. Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas. Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba. Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa. MaÃ±ana que amanezca un dia nuevo en mi universo. MaÃ±ana no verÃ© tu nombre escrito entre mis versos. No escucharÃ© palabras de arrepentimiento. IgnorarÃ© sin pena tu remordimiento. MaÃ±ana olvidarÃ© que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante. MaÃ±ana ni siquiera habrÃ¡ razones para odiarte. Yo borrarÃ© todos tus sueÃ±os de mis sueÃ±os. Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos. Â¿Que hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza. Hoy empaÃ±aste con tu furia mi mirada. Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia. Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba. Con un permiso para asi romperme el alma. Â¿Que hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas.

And it was all in vain. Time starts to pass. Before you know it you're frozen. But something happened. For the very first time with you. My heart melted to the ground. Found something true. And everyone's looking around. Thinking I'm going crazy. But I don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vein. That I keep on closing. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open. Trying hard not to hear. But they talk so loud. Their piercing sounds fill my ears. Try to fill me with doubt. Yet I know that the goalIs to keep me from falling. But nothing's greater than the rush. That comes with your embrace. And in this world of loneliness. I see your face. Yet everyone around me. Thinks that I'm going crazy. Maybe, maybe. But I don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vain. That I keep on closing. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open. And it's draining all of me. Oh, they find it hard to believe. I'll be wearing these scars. For everyone to see. I don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vain. That I keep on closing. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding loveThis was never the way I planned. Not my intention. I got so brave. Drink in hand. Lost my discretion. It's not what I'm used to.

Seas would rise when I gave the word. Now in the morning I sleep alone. Sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice. Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listen as the crowd would sing. "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!". One minute I held the key. Next the walls were closed on me. And I discovered that my castles stand. Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand. I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing. Roman Calvary choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain. Once you go there was never. Never an honest word. And that was when I ruled the world. It was the wicked and wild wind. Blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sound of drums. People couldn't believe what I'd become. Revolutionaries wait. For my head on a silver plate. Just a puppet on a lonely string. Oh who would ever want to be king?. I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing. Roman Calvary choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain. I know Saint Peter won't call my name. Never an honest word. But that was when I ruled the world. I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing. Roman Calvary choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain. I know Saint Peter won't call my name. Never an honest word. But that was when I ruled the worldOhh, how 'bout a round of applause?. Yeah, standin' ovation.

Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not. Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught. But you put on quite a show. You really had me goin'. But now it's time to go. Curtains finally closin'. That was quite a show. Very entertaining. But it's over now (but it's over now). Go on and take a bow. Grab your clothes and get gone. (You better hurry up) Before the sprinklers come on (come on). Talkin' 'bout "Girl, I love you you're the one". This just looks like a re-run (please). What else is on?. And don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not. Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught. But you put on quite a show. You really had me goin'. But now it's time to go.

I keep coming back for more. Keep my hand in the fire, sooner or later. I get what I'm asking for. No matter what you say about life. I learn every time I bleed. The truth is a stranger, soul is in danger. I gotta let my spirit be free. To admit that I'm wrong. And then change my mind. Sorry but I have to move on. And leave you behind. I can't waste time so give it a moment. I realize nothing's broken. No need to worry about everything I've done. Live every second like it was my last one. Don't look back, got a new direction. I loved you once, needed protection. You're still a part of everything I do. You're on my heart just like a tattoo. Just like a tattoo. I'll always have you. I'm sick of playing all of these games. It's not about taking sides. When I looked in the mirror didn't deliver. It hurt enough to think that I could. Stop, admit that I'm wrong. And then change my mind. Sorry but I've gotta be strong. And leave you behind. I can't waste time so give it a moment. I realize nothing's broken. No need to worry about everything I've done. Live every second like it was my last one. Don't look back, got a new direction. I loved you once, needed protection. You're still a part of everything I do. You're on my heart just like a tattoo. Just like a tattoo. I'll always have you. If I live every moment. Won't change any moment. That's still a part of me and you. I will never regret you. Still the memory of you. Marks everything I do. Can't waste time so give it a moment. I realize nothing's broken. No need to worry about everything I've done. Live every second like it was my last one. Don't look back, got a new direction. I loved you once, needed protection. You're still a part of everything I do. You're on my heart just like a tattoo. Can't waste time so give it a moment. I realized nothing's broken. No need to worry about everything I've done. Live every second like it was my last one. Don't look back, got a new direction. I loved you once and I needed protection. You're still a part of everything I do. You're on my heart just like a tattoo. Just like a tattoo. I'll always have youThis town is colder now, I think it's sick of us. It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust. I've got my heart set on anywhere but here. I'm staring down myself, counting up the years. Steady hands, just take the wheel.... And every glance is killing me. Time to make one last appeal. For the life I lead. Stop and stare. I think I'm moving but I go nowhere. Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared. But I've become what I can't be, oh. Stop and stare. You start to wonder why you're here not there. And you'd give anything to get what's fair. But fair ain't what you really need. Oh, can you see what I see?. They're trying to come back, all my senses push. Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could.... Steady feet, don't fail me now. I'mma run 'til you can't walk. Something pulls my focus out. And I'm standing down.... Stop and stare. I think I'm moving but I go nowhere. Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared. But I've become what I can't be, oh. Stop and stare. You start to wonder why you're here not there. And you'd give anything to get what's fair. But fair ain't what you really need. Oh, you don't need. What you need, what you need.... Stop and stare. I think I'm moving but I go nowhere. Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared. But I've become what I can't be. Oh, do you see what I see?I've made up my mind,. Don't need to think it over. If I'm wrong, I am right. Don't need to look no further,. This ain't lust. I know this is love. But if I tell the world. I'll never say enough. 'cause it was not said to you. And that's exactly what I need to do. If I end up with you. Should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. Or would it be a waste. Even if I knew my place?. Should I leave it there?. Should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. I build myself up. And fly around in circles. Waitin' as my heart drops. And my back begins to tingle. Finally, could this be it. Or should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. Or would it be a waste. Even if I knew my place?. Should I leave it there?. Should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. Should I give up?. Or should I just keep on chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. Or would it be a waste. Even if I knew my place?. Should I leave it there?. Should I give up?. Or should I just keep on chasin' pavements?. Should I just keep on chasin' pavements?. Ohh oh. should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. Or would it be a waste. Even if I knew my place?. Should I leave it there?. should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?Four letter word just to get me along. It's a difficulty and I'm bitin' on my tongue. And I, I keep stallin' and keepin' it together. People around gotta find somethin' to say now. Holdin' back everyday the same. Don't wanna be a loner. Listen to me, oh no. I never say anything at all. But with nothin' to consider they forget my name (ame, ame, ame). They call me hell. They call me Stacey. They call me Her. They call me Jane. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. They call me quiet. But I'm a riot. Mary-Jo-Lisa. Always the same. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. I'll miss the catch if they throw me the ball. I'm the last chick standing up against the wall. Keep fa-fallin', these heels that keep me borin'. Getting clamped up and sittin' on the fence now. So alone all the time and I lock myself away. Listen to me, oh no. And though I'm dressed up out and all. With everything considered they forget my name (ame, ame, ame). They call me hell. They call me Stacey. They call me her. They call me Jane. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. They call me quiet. But I'm a riot. Mary-Jo-Lisa. Always the same. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. Are you callin' me darlin'?. Are you callin' me bird?. Are you callin' me darlin'?. Are you callin' me bird?. They call me hell. They call me Stacey. They call me her. They call me Jane. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. They call me quiet. But I'm a riot. Mary-Jo-Lisa. Always the same. That's not my name. That's not my name.

They call me quiet. But I'm a riot. Mary-Jo-Lisa. Always the same. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. They call me hell. They call me Stacey. They call me her. They call me Jane. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. That's not my name. So alone all the time and I lock myself away. Though I'm dressed up out and all. With everything considered they forget my nameWas a long and dark December. From the rooftops I remember. There was snow. White snow. Clearly I remember. From the windows they were watching. While we froze down below. When the future's architectured. By a carnival of idiots on show. You'd better lie low. If you love me. Won't you let me know?. Was a long and dark December. When the banks became cathedrals. And a fox became God. Priests clutched onto bibles. Hollowed out to fit their rifles. And the cross was held aloft. Bury me in armor. When I'm dead and hit the ground. My nerves are poles that unfroze. If you love me. Won't you let me know?. I don't want to be a soldier. Who the captain of some sinking ship. Would stow, far below. So if you love me. Why'd you let me go?. I took my love down to violet hill. Then we sat in snow. All that time she was silent still. So if you love me. Won't you let me know?. If you love me. Won't you let me know?Hey baby girl, I've been watchin' you all day. Man that thing you got behind you is amazin'. You make me wanna take you out and let it rain.

It was awesome but we lost it it's not possible for me not to care. And now we're standing in the rain but nothing's ever gonna change until you hear my dear. The 7 things I hate about you.

Ohâ€¦ Never find a love like thisGoing back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move. Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand. Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?". Some try to hand me money, they don't understand. I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man. I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?. How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?. 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me. And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be. Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet. And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street. So I'm not moving, I'm not moving. Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here.". I said, "There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year.. Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows.. If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.". 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me. And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be. Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet. And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street. So I'm not moving, I'm not moving,. I'm not moving, I'm not moving. People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh. There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm. And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved. Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news. And you'll come running to the corner. 'Cause you'll know it's just for you. I'm the man who can't be moved. I'm the man who can't be moved. 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me. And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be. Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet. And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street. 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me. (So I'm not moving). And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be. (I'm not moving). Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet. (I'm not moving). And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street. (I'm not moving). Going back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna moveI just woke up from a fuzzy dream. You never would believe those things that I have seen. I looked in the mirror and I saw your face. You looked right through me, you were miles away. All my dreams they fade away. I'll never be the same. If you could see me the way you see yourself. I can't pretend to be someone else. You always love me more, miles away. I hear it in your voice, we're miles away. You're not afraid to tell me, miles away. I guess we're at our best when we're miles away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. When no one's around then I have you here. I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear. You always have the biggest heart. When we're six thousand miles apart. Too much of no sound. Uncomfortable silence can be so loud. Those three words are never enough. When it's long distance love. You always love me more, miles away. I hear it in your voice, we're miles away. You're not afraid to tell me, miles away. I guess we're at our best when we're miles away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true. When I'm gone you'll realize. That I'm the best thing that happened to you. You always love me more, miles away. I hear it in your voice, we're miles away. You're not afraid to tell me, miles away. I guess we're at our best when we're miles away. You always love me more, miles away. I hear it in your voice, we're miles away. You're not afraid to tell me, miles away. I guess we're at our best when we're miles away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far awayWhen I get to Warwick Avenue. Meet me by the entrance of the tube. We can talk things over alittle time. Promise me you won't step outta line.. When I get to Warwick Avenue. Please drop the past and be true. Don't think we're okay, just because I'm here. You hurt me bad, but I won't shed a tear. I'm leaving you for the last time baby. You think you're loving but you don't love me. I've been confused outta my mind lately. You think you're loving but I want to be free. Baby you've hurt me. When I get to Warwick Avenue. We'll spend an hour, but no more than two. Our only chance to speak once more. I showed you the answers, now here's the door. When I get to Warwick Avenue. I'll tell you baby... that we're through. I'm leaving you for the last time baby. You think you're loving but you don't love me. I've been confused outta my mind lately. You think you're loving but you don't love me. I want to be free, baby you've hurt me. All the days spent together. I wished for better. But I didn't want the train to come. Now it's departed, I'm broken-hearted. Seems like we never started. All those days spent together, when I wished for better. And I didn't want the train to come!. Oh, oh. You think you're loving but you don't love me. I want to be free, baby, you hurt me. You don't love me, I want to be free. Baby, you've hurt meHurry up and wait so close but so far away. Everything that you've always dreamed of. Close enough for you to taste but you just can't touch. You wanna show the world but no one knows your name yet. Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it. You know you can if you get the chance. In your face and the door keeps slamming. Now you're feeling more and more frustrated. And you're getting all kind of impatient, waiting. We live and we learn to take. One step at a time there's no need to rush. It's like learning to fly or falling in love. It's gonna happen and it's supposed to happen. That we find the reasons why, one step at a time. You believe and you doubt. You're confused and got it all figured out. Everything that you always wished for. Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours if they only knew. You wanna show the world but no one knows your name yet. Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it. You know you can if you get the chance. In your face and the door keeps slamming. Now you're feeling more and more frustrated. And you're getting all kind of impatient, waiting. We live and we learn to take. One step at a time there's no need to rush. It's like learning to fly or falling in love. It's gonna happen and it's supposed to happen. That we find the reasons why, one step at a time. When you can't wait any longer. But there's no end in sight. It's the faith that makes you stronger. The only way we get there is one step at a time. Take one step at a time there's no need to rush. It's like learning to fly or falling in love. It's gonna happen and it's supposed to happen. That we find the reasons why, one step at a time. One step at a time there's no need to rush. It's like learning to fly or falling in love. It's gonna happen and it's supposed to happen. That we find the reasons why, one step at a timeNAYou caught my teardrops. In your eyelid. You gave me strength. To say hello. You found me. Stranded on your island. It felt. Like I was coming home. And I know. That you're going places. Take a look. I'm right behind. Chorus:. Love is you. Seeing things like you do. Waking up next to you. Wanna give you all. All that I am. Love is you. You turn this world in two. Something I never knew. A beauty surrounds you. Love is you. You let me.

Impossible, impossible, Impossible, impossible. Falling out of love is hard, Falling for betrayal is worst. Broken trust and broken hearts, I know, I know. Thinking all you need is there, Building faith on love and words. Empty promises will wear, I know, I know. And now when all is gone, there is nothing to say. And if you're done with embarrassing me, On your own you can go ahead tell them. Tell them all I know now, Shout it from the roof tops. Write it on the sky line, All we had is gone now.

'Cause this is my destiny. . I will never say never. (I will fight). I will fight till forever. (Make it right). . Whenever you knock me down. I will not stay on the ground.

I gotcha lil bro, I can handle him. Hold up, aight? I can handle him. . Now he's bigger than me, taller than me. And he's older than me and stronger than me. And his arms a little bit longer than me. But he ain't on a JB song with me. . I be trying a chill. They be trying to side with the thrill. No pun intended. Was raised by the power of Will. . Like Luke with the Force. When push comes to shove. Like Kobe with the fourth. Ice water with blood. . I gotta be the best, and yes. We're the fliest like David and Goliath. I conquered the giant. So now I got the world in my hand. I was born from two stars. So the moon's where I land. . I will never say never. (I will fight). I will fight till forever. (Make it right). . Whenever you knock me down. I will not stay on the ground. Pick it up pick it up. Pick it up pick it up. Up, up, up, up, up and never say never. . Ne-never say never.

I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell. When you walk my way. I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell. Now where's your picket fence love?. And where's that shiny car?. Did it ever get you far?. You never seem so tense, love. I never seen you fall so hard. Do you know where you are?. And truth be told I miss you. And truth be told I'm lying. When you see my face. Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell. When you walk my way. Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell. If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well. (Treats you well). Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell. Hope it gives you hell. Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself. Yeah Where did it all go wrong?. But the list goes on and on. And truth be told I miss you. And truth be told I'm lying. When you see my face. Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell. When you walk my way. Hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell. If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well. (Treats you well). Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell. Now you'll never see. What you've done to me. You can take back your memories. They're no good to me. And here's all your lies. You can look me in the eyes. With the sad, sad look. That you wear so well. When you see my face. I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell. When you walk my way. I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell. If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well. (Treats you well). Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell. When you see my face. I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell. (hope it gives you hell).

You can sing along I hope that he will treat you wellTe amo, te amo. She says to me. I hear the pain in her voice. Then we danced underneath the candelabra. She takes the lead. That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over. Then she said te amo, then she put her hand around me waist. I told her no, she cried te amo. I told her I'm not gonna run away. But let me go. My soul is awry. Without asking why I said te amo. Wish somebody'd tell me what she said. Don't it mean I love you?. Think it means I love you. Don't it mean I love you?. Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe. I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh. Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water. I start to leave. She's begging me and asking why it's over. Then she said te amo, then she put her hand around me waist. I told her no, she cried te amo. I told her I'm not gonna run away. But let me go. My soul is awry. Without asking why I said te amo. Wish somebody'd tell me what she said. Don't it mean I love you?. Think it means I love you. Don't it mean I love you?. Listen, we can dance. But you gotta watch your hands. Watch me all night, I'm moving through the light because I understand. That we all need love. And I'm not afraid. To feel the love, but I don't feel that way. Then she said te amo, then she put her hand around me waist. I told her no, she cried te amo. I told her I'm not gonna run away. But let me go. My soul is awry. Without asking why I said te amo. Wish somebody'd tell me what she said. Don't it mean I love you?. Think it means I love you. Don't it mean I love you?. I think it means I love you, I love you. Te amo, te amo. Don't it mean I love you?My head is stuck in the clouds, she begs me to come down. Says, "Boy, quit foolin' around". I told her, "I love the view from up here, warm sun and wind in my ear. We'll watch the world from above as it turns to the rhythm of love". We may only have tonight. But 'til the morning sun, you're mine, all mine. Play the music low. And sway to the rhythm of love. Well, my heart beats like a drum, guitar string to the strum. A beautiful song to be sung. She's got blue eyes, deep like the sea that roll back when she's laughin' at me. She rises up like the tide the moment her lips meet mine. We may only have tonight. But 'til the morning sun, you're mine, all mine. Play the music low. And sway to the rhythm of love. When the moon is low. We can dance in slow motion. And all your tears will subside. All your tears will dry. And long after I've gone, you'll still be humming along. And I will keep you in my mind, the way to make love so fine. We may only have tonight. But 'til the morning sun, you're mine, all mine. Play the music low. And sway to the rhythm of love. Play the music low. And sway to the music of love. Yeah, sway to the music of loveWhen your heart is weak,. You don't know where to go,. And you cannot sleep,. And it's time to know,.

Until you kissed my lips and you saved me. My hands, they were strong, but my knees were far too weak. To stand in your arms without falling to your feet. But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew. All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true. And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win. But I set fire to the rain. Watched it pour as I touched your face. Well, it burned while I cried. 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name. When laying with you I could stay there. Close my eyes, feel you here forever. You and me together, nothing is better. 'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew. All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true.

'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name. I set fire to the rain. And I threw us into the flames. When we fell, something died. 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time.

Watched it pour as I touch your face. Well, it burned while I cried. 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name. I set fire to the rain. And I threw us into the flames.

She went down in an airplane. Fried getting suntan. Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand. Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!. She met a shark under water. Fell and no one caught her. I returned everything I ever bought her. Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies. And ways to say you died. My pride still feels the sting. You were my everything. Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours). She'll think I'm Superman. Not super minivan. How could you leave on Yom Kippur?. That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say. She was caught in a mudslide. Eaten by a lion. Got run over by a crappy purple Scion. Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!. She dried up in the desert. Drowned in a hot tub. Danced to death at an east side night club. Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies. And ways to say you died. I wanna live a thousand lives with you. I wanna be the one you're dying to. Love... but you don't want to. That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say. That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say.

I told her my name and said "it's nice to meet ya". Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila. I already know she's a keeper. Just from this one small act of kindness. I'm in deep if anybody finds out. I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now. Not sobering up we just sit on the couch. One thing led to another. Now she's kissing my mouth.

La Di, La Da, La DaI drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted. I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted. And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine. Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?. When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?. Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?. If what we had was real, how could you be fine?. 'Cause I'm not fine at all. I remember the day you told me you were leaving. I remember the make-up running down your face. And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them. Like every single wish we ever made. I wish that I could wake up with amnesia. And forget about the stupid little things. Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you. And the memories I never can escape. 'Cause I'm not fine at all. The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone. I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone. And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around. It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've moved on. It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long. It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?. If what we had was real, how could you be fine?. 'Cause I'm not fine at all. I remember the day you told me you were leaving. I remember the make-up running down your face. And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them. Like every single wish we ever made. I wish that I could wake up with amnesia. And forget about the stupid little things. Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you. And the memories I never can escape. If today I woke up with you right beside me. Like all of this was just some twisted dream. I'd hold you closer than I ever did before. And you'd never slip away. And you'd never hear me say. I remember the day you told me you were leaving. I remember the make-up running down your face. And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them. Like every single wish we ever made. I wish that I could wake up with amnesia. And forget about the stupid little things. Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you. And the memories I never can escape. 'Cause I'm not fine at all. No, I'm really not fine at all. Tell me this is just a dream. 'Cause I'm really not fine at allI keep going to the river to pray. 'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain. And at most. I'm sleeping all these demons away. But your ghost, the ghost of you. It keeps me awake. My friends had you figured out. Yeah they saw what's inside of you. You tried hiding another you. But your evil was coming through. These eyes sitting on the wall. They watch every move I make. Bright light living in the shade. Your cold heart makes my spirit shake. I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane. Had to meet the devil just to know his name. And that's when my love was burning. Yeah it's still burning. I keep going to the river to pray. 'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain. And at most. I'm sleeping all these demons away. But your ghost, the ghost of you. It keeps me awake. I keep going to the river to pray. 'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain. And at most. I'm sleeping all these demons away. But your ghost, the ghost of you. It keeps me awake. Each time that I think you go. I turn around and you're creeping in. And I let you under my skin. Guess I love living in the sin. Oh you never told me. True love was gonna hurt. True pain I don't deserve. Truth is that I never learn. I keep going to the river to pray. 'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain. And at most. I'm sleeping all these demons away. But your ghost, the ghost of you. It keeps me awake. I keep going to the river to pray. 'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain. And at most. I'm sleeping all these demons away. But your ghost, the ghost of you. It keeps me awake. Give off the ghost. Give off the ghost. Give off the ghost. Stop the haunting baby. Give off the ghost. Give off the ghost. Give off the ghost. No more haunting baby. I keep going to the river. I keep going to the river to pray. 'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain. And at most. I'm sleeping all these demons away. But your ghost, the ghost of you. It keeps me awake. I keep going to the river to pray. 'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain. And at most. I'm sleeping all these demons away. But your ghost, the ghost of you. It keeps me awakeYou can be amazing . You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug . You can be the outcast . Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love . Or you can start speaking up . Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do . And they settle ‘neath your skin . Kept on the inside and no sunlight . Sometimes a shadow wins . But I wonder what would happen if you . Say what you wanna say . And let the words fall out . Honestly I wanna see you be brave . With what you want to say . And let the words fall out . Honestly I wanna see you be brave . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I wanna see you be brave . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I wanna see you be brave . Everybody’s been there, everybody’s been stared down . By the enemy . Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing . Bow down to the mighty . Don’t run, stop holding your tongue . Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live . Maybe one of these days you can let the light in . Show me how big your brave is . Say what you wanna say . And let the words fall out . Honestly I wanna see you be brave . With what you want to say . And let the words fall out . Honestly I wanna see you be brave . Innocence, your history of silence . Won’t do you any good . Did you think it would? . Let your words be anything but empty . Why don’t you tell them the truth? . Say what you wanna say . And let the words fall out . Honestly I wanna see you be brave .

I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake. I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait. But then I jumped right in a week later returned. I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn. But I gave her my time for two or three nights. Then I put it on pause until the moment was right. I went away for months until our paths crossed again. She told me I was never looking for a friend. Maybe you could swing by my room around ten. Baby, bring the lemon & a bottle of gin. We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM. Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said. She's singing.... la, la, la, la. Don't with my love. That heart is so cold. All over my own. I don't wanna know that, babe. la, la, la. Don't with my love. I told her, she knows. Take aim & reload. I don't wanna know that, babe. la, la, la. For a couple of weeks I only want to see her. We drink away the days with a take away pizza. Before a text message was the only way to reach her. Now she's staying at my place & loves the way I treat her. Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature. And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either. But me & her we make money the same way. Four cities, two planes the same day. And those shows have never been what it's about. Maybe we'll go together & just figure it out. I'd rather put on a film with you & sit on the couch. But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now. Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out. When she was kissing him how I was confused about. She should figure it out why I'm sat here singing. Don't with my love. That heart is so cold. All over my own. I don't wanna know that, babe. Don't with my love. I told her, she knows. Take aim & reload. I don't wanna know that, babe. On my hotel door!. I don't even know if she knows what for. She was crying on my shoulder, I already told you. Trust & respect is what we do this for. I never intended to be next. But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all. And I never saw him as a threat. Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course. It's not like we were both on tour. We were staying on the same hotel floor. And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment. But it was never just fun & I thought you were different. This is not the way you realize what you wanted. It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest. And all this time God knows I'm singing. Don't with my love. That heart is so cold. All over my own. I don't wanna know that, babe. Don't with my love. I told her, she knows. Take aim & reload. I don't wanna know that, babe. Don't with my love. That heart is so cold. All over my own. I don't wanna know that babe. Don't with my love. I told her, she knows. Take aim & reload. I don't wanna know that, babeEvery time that you get undressed. I hear symphonies in my head. I wrote this song just looking at you, oh, oh. Yeah, the drums they swing low. And the trumpets they go.

Descemer Bueno & Gente De Zona). . Yo te miro, se me corta la respiración. Cuanto tu me miras se me sube el corazón. (Me palpita lento el corazon). Y en silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras. La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol. . (Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando). Tu cuerpo y el mio llenando el vacío. Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando). (Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando). Ese fuego por dentro me esta enloqueciendo. Me va saturando. . Con tu física y tu química también tu anatomía. La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la mía. Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas) Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas). Con esta melodía, tu color, tu fantasía. Con tu filosofía mi cabeza esta vacía. Y ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas). Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas). . Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo. Bailar contigo, tener contigo. Una noche loca (una noche loca). Ay besar tu boca (y besar tu boca). Yo quiero estar contigo, vivir contigo. Bailar contigo, tener contigo una noche loca. Con tremenda loca. (Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh). . Tu me miras y me llevas a otra dimensión. . (Estoy en otra dimensión). Tu latidos aceleran a mi corazón. (Tu latidos aceleran a mi corazón). Que ironía del destino no poder tocarte. Abrazarte y sentir la magia de tu olor. . (Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando). Tu cuerpo y el mio llenando el vacío. Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando).

Well their time has passed. Peering from the mirror. No, that isn't me. A stranger getting nearer. Who can this person be?. You wouldn't know me at all. Today. From the fading light I'll fly. Rise like a phoenix. Out of the ashes. Seeking rather than vengeance. Retribution. You were warned. Once I'm transformed. Once I'm reborn. You know I will rise like a phoenix. But you're my flame. Go about your business. Act as if you're free. No one could have witnessed. What you did to me. Cause you wouldn't know me today. And you have got to see. To believe. From the fading light I fly. Rise like a phoenix. Out of the ashes. Seeking rather than vengeance. Retribution. You were warned. Once I'm transformed. Once I'm reborn. I rise up to the sky. You threw me down but. I'm gonna fly. And rise like a phoenix. Out of the ashes. Seeking rather than vengeance. Retribution. You were warned. Once I'm transformed. Once I'm reborn. You know I will rise like a phoenix. But you're my flameNAIt's Christmas time,. There's no need to be afraid. At Christmas time,. We let in light and we banish shade. And in our world of plenty,. We can spread our smile of joy. Feel your arms around the world at Christmas time. But say a prayer. And pray for the other ones. At christmas time it's hard,. But while your having fun. There's a world outside your window. And it's a world of dread and fear. Where a kiss of love can kill you. Where there's death in every tear. And the Christmas bells that ring there. Are the clanging chimes of doom. Well, tonight we're reaching out and touching you. Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa. A song of hope where there's no hope tonight (ooh). Why is comfort to be feared,. Why is to touch to be scared. How can they know it's Christmas time at all?. Here's to you. Raise a glass to everyone. Here's to them. And all there is to come. Can they know it's Christmas time at all?. Feed the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Feel the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Heal the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Feed the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Feel the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Heal the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Feed the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Feel the world. Let them know it's Christmas time againNANANA
