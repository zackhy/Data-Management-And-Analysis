Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?. Are you sorry we drifted apart?. Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day?. When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?. Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?. Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?. Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?. Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight. I wonder if you're lonesome tonight. You know someone said that the world's a stage. And each must play a part. Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweet heart. Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance. You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue. Then came act two, you seemed to change, you acted strange. And why? I've never known. Honey, you lied when you said you loved me. And I had no cause to doubt you. But I'd rather go on hearing your lies. Than I go on living without you. Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there. With emptiness all around. And if you won't come back to me. Then they can bring the curtain down. Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?. Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonightIt's now or never. come hold me tight. Kiss me my darling. be mine tonight. Tomorrow will be too late. it's now or never. My love won't wait.. When I first saw you. with your smile so tender. My heart was captured. my soul surrendered. I'd spend a lifetime. waiting for the right time. Now that your near. the time is here at last.. It's now or never. come hold me tight. Kiss me my darling. be mine tonight. Tomorrow will be too late. it's now or never. My love won't wait.. Just like a willow. we would cry an ocean. If we lost true love. and sweet devotion. Your lips excite me. let your arms invite me. For who knows when. we'll meet again this way. It's now or never. come hold me tight. Kiss me my darling. be mine tonight. Tomorrow will be too late. it's now or never.

With white clouds high above. Once they were part of. An everlasting love. We were the lovers who strolled. Through greenfields.. Greenfields are gone now. Parched by the sun. Gone from the valleys. Where rivers used to run. Gone with the cold wind. That swept in to my heart. Gone with the lovers. Who let their dreams depart. Where are the greenfields that we. Used to roam.. I'll never know what made you run away. How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day. I only know there's nothing here for me. Nothing in this wild world left for me to see.. But I'll keep on waiting. 'Til you return. I'll keep on waiting. Until the day you learn. You can't be happy. When your heart's on a roam. You can't be happy. Until you bring it home. Home to the greenfields and me. Once again.I just got your letter baby. Too bad you can't come home. I swear I'm goin' crazy. Sittin' here all alone. Since you're gone I got a mess out of blues.

He wears a dustman's hat. He wears cor-blimey trousers. And he lives in a council flat. Lonnie: I say, I say, Les.. Les: Yes?. Lonnie: I, er, I found a police dog in my dustbin.

Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way. Two drifters, off to see the world. There's such a lot of world to see. We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend. My huckleberry friend, moon river, and meBig John. Big John. Ev'ry mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive. He stood six foot six and weighed two forty five. Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip. And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John. (Big John, Big John). Big Bad John. (Big John). Nobody seemed to know where John called home. He just drifted into town and stayed all alone. He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy. And if you spoke at all, he just said, "Hi" to Big John. Somebody said he came from New Orleans. Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen. And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand. Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John. (Big John, Big John). Big Bad John. (Big John). Then came the day at the bottom of the mine. When a timber cracked and men started cryin'. Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast. And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John. Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell. Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well. Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan. And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John. (Big John, Big John). Big Bad John. (Big John). And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove. Then a miner yelled out, "There's a light up above". And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave. Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John. With jacks and timbers they started back down. Then came that rumble way down in the ground. And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine. Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John. (Big John, Big John). Big Bad John. (Big John). Now they never reopened that worthless pit. They just placed a marble stand in front of it. These few words are written on that stand. At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John. (Big John, Big John). Big Bad John. (Big John). (Big John). Big Bad JohnLittle sister, don't you. Little sister, don't you.

He said: “Oh they probably took off late,. or they may have run into some turbulent weather and had to alter the course”. I went back outside and waited at the gate. and I watched the beacon light from the control tower. as it whipped through the dark ebony skies if it were searching for –. Sung:(My Ebony Eyes). And then came the announcement over the loudspeaker,. “Would those having relatives or friends on Flight number 1203. please report to the chapel across the street at once”. Then I felt a burning break deep inside. And I knew the heavenly ebony skies. Had taken my life’s most wonderful prize. My beautiful Ebony Eyes. If I ever get, to heaven I’ll bet.

All alone with just a beat of my heart. People all around but I don't hear a sound. Just the lonely beating of my heart. No other voice can say the words. My heart must hear to ever sing again.

Just the lonely beating of my heartThough we gotta say goodbye for the summer. Darling, I promise you this. I'll send you all my love everyday in a letter. Sealed with a kiss.

I'll hear your voice everywhere. I'll run to tenderly hold you. But darling, you won't be there. I don't wanna say goodbye for the summer. Knowing the love we'll miss. Oh, let us make a pledge to meet in September. And seal it with a kiss. Yes, it's gonna be a cold lonely summer. But I'll fill the emptiness. I'll send you all my love everyday in a letter. Sealed with a kiss. Sealed with a kiss. Sealed with a kissWhen you're young and so in love as we. And bewildered by the world we see. Why do people hurt us so. Only those in love would know. What a town without pity can do. . If we stop to gaze upon a star. People talk about how bad we are. Ours is not an easy age. We're like tigers in a cage. What a town without pity can do. . The young have problems, many problems. We need an understanding heart. Why don't they help us, try and help us. Before this clay and granite planet falls apart. Take these eager lips and hold me fast. I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last. . How can we keep love alive. How can anything survive. When these little minds tear you in two. What a town without pity can do. . How can we keep love alive. How can anything survive. When these little minds tear you in two. What a town without pity can do. .

We danced around to a rockin' band. And when I could I gave that girl a hug. In the tunnel of love. You'll never know how great a kiss can feel. When you stop at the top of a ferris wheel.

Lover please, please come back. Don't take a train comin' down the track. Don't, please don't, don't leave me. Don't leave me in misery. You would never hold me so near. You would never call me "Dear". Don'tcha know I'd die for you?. Now you're gone, that's what I'll do. CHORUS. All those stories, not too long. About a love that went all wrong. The girl left the boy, just as bad. Now she's gone, she's so sad. CHORUS. You would never hold me so near. You would never have called me "Dear". Don'tcha know I'd die for you?. Now you're gone, that's what I'll do. CHORUS FADESAl di la, means you are far above me, very far. Al di la, as distant as the lovely evening star. Where you walk flowers bloom. When you smile all the gloom turns to sunshine. And my heart opens wide. When you're gone it fades inside and seems to have died. Al di la, I wondered as I drifted where you were. Al di la, the fog around me lifted. There you were in the kiss that I gave was the love I had saved for a lifetime. Then I knew all of you was completely minePARTY LIGHTS. Claudine Clark.

I've played a ace and I won the queen. I walked away with your heart. From a jack to a king. With no regrets I stacked, I stacked the cards, I stacked the cards last night. And lady luck played her hand just right. You made me king of your heart. Oh for just a little while I thought that I might lose the game. Oh but just in time I saw that twinkle in your eyes. From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding, wedding, wedding ring. I played an ace and I won the queen. You made me king of your heart. For just a little while I thought that I might lose the game. Oh but just in time I saw, I saw that twinkle in your eyes. From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding, wedding, wedding ring.

Like a queen with her king. Oh, what a birthday surprise. Judy's wearin' his ring. It's my party and I'll cry if I want to. Cry if I want to, cry if I want to. You would cry too if it happened to you. It's my party and I'll cry if I want to. Cry if I want to, cry if I want to. You would cry too if it happened to youWe're all goin' on a summer holiday.

I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain. And let me be alone again. The only girl I care about has gone away. Looking for a brand new start. But little does she know that when she left that day. Along with her she took my heart. Rain, please tell me, now, does that seem fair. For her to steal my heart away when she don't care?. I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away. The only girl I care about has gone away. Looking for a brand new start. But little does she know that when she left that day. Along with her she took my heart. Rain, won't you tell her that I love her so?. Please, ask the sun to set her heart aglow. Rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow.

Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper. "Go to sleep, everything is all right". I close my eyes, then I drift away. Into the magic night, I softly say. A silent prayer like dreamers do. Then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you. In dreams I walk with you. In dreams I talk to you. In dreams you're mine all of the time. We're together in dreams, in dreams. But just before the dawn. I awake and find you gone. I can't help it, I can't help it, if I cry. I remember that you said goodbye. It's too bad that all these things. Can only happen in my dreams. Only in dreams. In beautiful dreamsAs we stroll along together. Holding hands, walking all alone. So in love are we two. That we don't know what to do. So in love (doo, so in love). In a world of our own (doo, so in love). As we stroll by the sea together. Under stars twinkling high above. So in love are we two. No one else but me and you. So in love (doo, so in love). So much in love (doo, so in love). So in love (doo, so in love). So much in love (doo, so in love). We stroll along together. I tell you I need you oh so much. I love, love you my darling.

Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou. Savin' nickels, savin' dimes. Workin' till the sun don't shine. Lookin' forward to happier times on Blue Bayou. I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou. Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou. All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see. That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be. Oh, to see my baby again. And to be with some of my friends. Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou. I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on Blue Bayou. Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou. Ah, that girl of mine by my side, the silver moon and the evening tide. Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside. I'll never be blue, my dreams come true. On Blue BayouI said, "Take it easy, baby. I worked all day and my feet feel just like lead. You got my shirt tails flyin' all over the place. And the sweat poppin' out of my head". She said, "Hey, bossa nova baby. Keep on workin' for this ain't no time to quit". She said, "Go, bossa nova baby keep on dancin'. I'm about to have myself a fit". Bossa nova, bossa nova. I said, “Hey little mama, let's sit down. Have a drink and dig the band". She said, "Drink, drink, drink oh, fiddle-de-dink. I can dance with a drink in my hand". She said, "Hey bossa nova baby. Keep on workin' for this ain't no time to drink". She said, "Go bossa nova baby. Keep on dancin', 'cause I ain't got time to think". Bossa nova, bossa nova. I said, "Come on baby, it's hot in here. And it's oh so cool outside. If you lend me a dollar, I can buy some gas. And we can go for a little ride". She said, "Hey bossa nova baby. Keep on workin' for I ain't got time for that". She said, "Go bossa nova baby. Keep on dancin' or I'll find myself another cat". Bossa nova, bossa nova. Bossa nova, bossa nova. Bossa nova, bossa novaThey say, I'll love again, someday. A true love will come my way, the next time. But after you, there'll be, never be, a next time for me. They say that, I'll find happiness in someone. Else, warm caress, the next time. I'll soon forget, your kiss and heartaches, such as this will. Just be ancient history. They say that, I'm a fool to weep. That, I won't go on losing sleep, the next time. And someone else will mend the heart you've broken in two. But how can I fall in love the next time?. When I'm still, so much in love with you. When I'm still, so much in love with youThe days of wine and roses. Laugh and run away like a child at play. Through the meadow land toward a closing door. A door marked 'Nevermore' that wasn't there before. The lonely night discloses. Just a passing breeze filled with memories. Of the golden smile that introduced me to. The days of wine and roses and youWhen this old world starts getting me down. And people are just too much for me to face. I climb way up to the top of the stairs. And all my cares just drift right into space. On the roof, it's peaceful as can be. And there, the world below can't bother me. Let me tell you now. When I come home feeling tired and beat. I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (Up on the roof). I get away from the hustling crowds. And all that rat race noise down in the street (Up on the roof). On the roof's the only place I know. Where you just have to wish to make it so. Let's go up on the roof (Up on the roof). At night, the stars put on a show for free. And, darling, you can share it all with me. I keep-a tellin' you. Right smack dab in the middle of town. I found a paradise that's trouble-proof (Up on the roof). And if this world starts getting you down. There's room enough for two up on the roof (Up on the roof). Up on the roof (Up on the roof). Oh, come on, baby (Up on the roof). Oh, come on, honey (Up on the roof). Everything is all right (Up on the roof)How many roads must a man walk down. Before you call him a man?. How many seas must a white dove sail. Before she sleeps in the sand?. Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly. Before they're forever banned?. The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind. The answer is blowing in the wind. [Verse 2-. Yes, How many years can a mountain exist. Before it is washed to the sea?. Yes, and how many years can some people exist. Before they're allowed to be free?. Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head. And pretend that he just doesn't see?. The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind. The answer is blowing in the wind. [Verse 3-. Yes, How many times must a man look up. Before he can see the sky?. Yes, and how many ears must one man have. Before he can hear people cry?. Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows. That too many people have died?. The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind. The answer is blowing in the windWhen I was young my father said. "Son, I have something to say". And what he told me, I'll never forget. Until my dyin' day. He said, "Son, you are a bachelor boy. And that's the way to stay. Son, you be a bachelor boy. Until your dyin' dayâ€. When I was sixteen I fell in love. With a girl as sweet as can be. But I remembered just in time. What my daddy said to me. He said, "Son you are a bachelor boy. And that's the way to stay. Son, you be a bachelor boy. Until your dyin' dayâ€. As time goes by I probably will. Meet a girl and fall in love. Then I'll get married have a wife and a child. And they'll be my turtle doves. But until then I'll be a bachelor boy. And that's the way I'll stay. Happy to be a bachelor boy. Until my dyin' day. Yeah, I'll be a bachelor boy. And that's the way I'll stay. Happy to be a bachelor boy. Until my dyin' dayWhen the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls. And the stars begin to twinkle in the night. In the mist of a memory you wander on back to me.

And as long as my heart will beat, sweet lover we'll always meet. Here in my deep purple dreams. Here in my deep purple dreams. When the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls. And the stars begin to twinkle in the night. In the mist of a memory you wander back to me. Breathing my name with a sigh. In the still of the night once again I hold you tight. Though you're gone, your love lives on when moonlight beams. And as long as my heart will beat, sweet lover we'll always meet. Here in my deep purple dreams.

And get down on her knees. Yeah, that's how it begins. She'll feel those needles and pins. A hurtin her, a hurtin her. Why can't I stop. And tell myself I'm wrong?. I'm wrong, so alone. Why can't I stand up. And tell myself I'm strong?. Because I saw her today, I saw her face. It was a face I loved and I knew. I had to run away. And get down on my knees and pray. That they'd go away. But still they begin. Needles and pins. Because of all my pride. The tears I gotta hide. Needles and pins. Needles and pins. Needles and pinsClose your eyes and I'll kiss you.

But a spark still burned so I used my knife. And late that night, I saved the life of Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. I nursed him till the danger passed. The days went by, he mended fast. Then from dawn till setting sun. He practiced with that deadly gun. And hour on hour, I watched in awe. No human being could match the draw of Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. One day, we rode the mountain crest. And I went east and he went west. I took to law and wore a star. While he spread terror near and far. With lead and blood, he gained such fame. All thought the West they feared the name of Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. I knew someday, I'd face the test. Which one of us would be the best. And sure enough the word came down. That he was holed up in the town. I left the posse out in the street. And I went in alone to meet Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. They said my speed was next to none. But my lightning draw had just begun. When I heard a blast that stung my wrist. The gun went flying from my fist. And I was looking down the bore. Of the deadly .44 of Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. They say that was the only time. That anyone had seen him smile. He slowly lowered his gun and then. He said to me, "We're even, friend". And so at last, I understood. That there was still a spark of good in Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. I blocked the path of his retreat. He turned and stepped into the street. A dozen guns spit fire and lead. A moment later, he lay dead. The town began to shout and cheer. Nowhere was there shed a tear for Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. The story spread throughout the land. That I had beaten Ringo's hand. And it was just the years, they say. That made me put my guns away. But on his grave they can't explain. The tarnished star above the name of Ringo. Ringo, Ringo. Ringo, RingoIn a little cafe. Just the other side of the border. She was just sitting there givin' me looks. That made my mouth water. So I started walking her way. She belonged to bad man, Jose. And I knew, yes I knew I should leave. When I heard her say, yeah. Come a little bit closer. You're my kind of man. So big and so strong. Come a little bit closer. I'm all alone and the night is so long. So we started to dance. In my arms, she felt so inviting. And I just couldn't resist. Just one little kiss, so exciting. Then I heard the guitar player say. "Vamoose, Jose's on his way". Then I knew, yes I knew I should run. But then I heard her say, yeah. Come a little bit closer. You're my kind of man. So big and so strong. Come a little bit closer. I'm all alone and the night is so long. Then the music stopped. When I looked the cafe was empty. Then I heard Jose say. "Man, you know you're in trouble plenty". So I dropped my drink from my hand. And through the window I ran. And as I rode away. I could hear her say to Jose, yeah. Come a little bit closer. You're my kind of man. So big and so strong. Come a little bit closer. I'm all alone and the night is so long. La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la. Wo oh ho. I still hear her say. I still hear her sayYou're my world. You're every breath I take. You're my world. You're every move I make. Other eyes see the. Stars up in the sky. But for me they shine. Within your eyes. As the trees reach. For the sun above. So my arms reach out. To you for love. With your hand. Resting in mine. I feel a power so divine. You're my world. You are my night and day. You're my world. You're every prayer I pray. If our love ceases to be. Then it's the end of. My world for me. With your hand. Resting in mine. I feel a power so divine. You're my world. You are my night and day. You're my world. You're every prayer I pray. If our love ceases to be. Then it's the end of my world. End of my world. End of my world for meRidin' along in my automobile. My baby beside me at the wheel. I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile. My curiosity runnin' wild. Cruisin' and playin' the radio. With no particular place to go. Ridin' along in my automobile. I was anxious to tell her the way I feel. So I told her softly and sincere. And she leaned and whispered in my ear. Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow. With no particular place to go. No particular place to go. So we parked way out on the Kokomo. The night was young and the moon was bold. So we both decided to take a stroll. Can you imagine the way I felt?. I couldn't unfasten her safety belt. Ridin' along in my calaboose. Still tryin' to get her belt a-loose. All the way home I held a grudge. For the safety belt that wouldn't budge. Cruisin' and playin' the radio. With no particular place to goLittle children, you better not tell on me. I'm tellin' you little children, you better not tell what you see. And if you're good, I'll give you candy and a quarter. If you're quiet like you oughta be and keep a secret with me. I wish they would go away, little children. Now why ain't you playin' outside? I'm askin' you. You can't fool me 'cause I'm gonna know if you hide. And try to peek, I'm gonna treat you to a movie. Stop your gigglin', children do be nice like little sugars and spice. You saw me kissin' your sister. You saw me holdin' her hand. But if you snitch to your mother. Your father won't understand. I wish they would take a nap, little children. Now why don't you go bye-bye? Go anywhere at all. Little children, I know you would go if you tried. Go up the stairs, me and your sister, we're goin' steady. How can I kiss her when I'm ready to with little children like you around?. I wonder what can I do around little children like youI love you, there's nothing to hide. It's better than burning inside. I love you, no use to pretend. There! I've said it again. I've said it, what more can I say?. Believe me, there's no other way. I love you, I will to the end. There! I've said it again. I try to drum up. A phrase that will sum up. All that I feel for you. But what good are phrases?. The thought that amazes. Is that you love me. And it's heavenly. Forgive me for wanting you so. But one thing I want you to know. I've loved you since heaven knows when. There! I've said it againWell, baby used to stay out all night long. She made me cry, she done me wrong. She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie. Tables turn and now her turn to cry. Because I used to love her, . but it's all over now. Because I used to love her, . but it's all over now. Well, she used to run around with every man in town. She spent all my money, playing her high class game. She put me out, it was a pity how I cried. Tables turn and now her turn to cry. Because I used to love her, . but it's all over now. Because I used to love her, . but it's all over now. Well, I used to wake the morning, get my breakfast in bed. When I'd gotten worried, she'd ease my aching head. But now she's here and there, with every man in town. Still trying to take me for that same old clown. Because I used to love her, . but it's all over now. Because I used to love her, . but it's all over now. Because I used to love her, . but it's all over now. Because I used to love her, . but it's all over nowWell, where oh where can my baby be. The Lord took her away from me. She's gone to heaven so I got to be good. So I can see my baby when I leave this ol' world. We were out on a date in my Daddy's car. We hadn't driven very far. There in the road, straight ahead. The car was stalled, the engine was dead. I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right. Never forget the sound that night. The cryin' tires, the bustin' glass. The painful scream that I heard last. Well, where oh where can my baby be. The Lord took her away from me. She's gone to heaven so I got to be good. So I can see my baby when I leave this ol' world. Well, when I woke up the rain was pourin' down. There were people standing all around. Something warm a-running in my eyes. But I found my baby somehow that night. I raised her head and when she smiled and said. "Hold me darling for a little while". I held her close I kissed her our last kiss. I found the love that I knew I would miss. But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight. I lost my love my life, that night. Well, where oh where can my baby be. The Lord took her away from me. She's gone to heaven so I got to be good. So I can see my baby when I leave this ol' worldMy love don't give me presents. I know that she's no peasant. Only ever has to give me. Love forever and forever. My love don't give me presents. Turn me on when I get lonely. People tell me that she's only fooling. I know she isn't. She don't give boys the eye. She hates to see me cry. She is happy just to hear me.

But I know I'll never find another you. It's a long, long journey. So stay by my side. When I walk through the storm. You'll be my guide, be my guide. If they gave me a fortune. My treasure would be small. I could lose it all tomorrow. And never mind at all. But if I should lose your love, dear. I don't know what I'll do. For I know I'll never find another you.

J'avais dessiné sur le sable. Son doux visage qui me souriait,. Puis il a plu sur cette plage.. Dans cet orage elle a disparu.. . Et j'ai crié, crié... "Aline !". Faut qu'elle revienne.. Et j'ai pleuré, pleuré... Oh j'avais trop de peine.. . Je me suis assis auprès de son âme. Mais la belle dame s'était enfuie.. Je l'ai cherchée sans plus y croire. Et sans un espoir pour me guider.. . Et j'ai crié, crié... "Aline !" pour qu'elle revienne.. Et j'ai pleuré, pleuré... Oh j'avais trop de peine.. Je n'ai gardé que ce doux visage.

All you left is our favorite song. The one we danced to all night long. It used to bring sweet memories. Of a tender love that used to be. . Now it's the same old song. But with a different meaning since you been gone. It's the same, same old song. But with a different meaning since you been gone. . Ah, oh a sentimental fool am I. To hear an old love song. And wanna cry. But the melody keeps haunting me. Reminding me how in love we used to be. Keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts. Saying together forever. Darling, breaking up never. . It's the same old song, can't bear to hear it. But with a different meaning since you been gone. Oh, it hurts to hear it. It's the same old song. But with a different meaning since you been gone. . Precious memories keep a lingering on. Every time I hear our favorite song. Now you've gone. Left this emptiness. I only reminisce the happiness we spent. We used to dance to the music. Make romance to the music. . Now, it's the same old song. But with a different meaning since you been gone. Now, it's the same old song. But with a different meaning since you been gone. I, oh I. Can't bear to hear it. It's the same old song. But with a different meaning since you been gone.

Better take it from me. You'll think she's a prize at the start. But take my advice, play it smart. She's nothin' but trouble. Better cut out on the double. Before she gets into your heart. She's a must to avoid. A complete impossibility. She's a must to avoid. Better take it from me. When you stare into her pretty blue eyes. There's no way to see through her disguise. But don't try to love her 'cause you'll quickly discover. You're trapped in the web of her lies. She's a must to avoid. A complete impossibility. She's a must to avoid. Better take it from me. Her lips look inviting it's true. But lots of other guys have felt like you do. She'll build up your hopes and when you need her the most. That's when she'll say goodbye to you. She's a must to avoid. A complete impossibility. She's a must to avoid. Better take it from meSo tired, tired of waiting. Tired of waiting for you. So tired, tired of waiting.

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony. A tender melody pulling me closer. Closer to your arms. Then suddenly, I hear a symphony. Ooh, your lips are touching mine. A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind. I'm lost in a world made for you and me. Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony. Play sweet and tenderly. Every time your lips meet mine, now baby. Baby, baby, you bring much joy within. Don't let this feeling end let it go on and on, and on. Now baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes. I cry not for myself but for those who never felt the joy we felt. Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony. Each time you speak to me. I hear a tender rapsody of love, now. Baby, baby, as you stand holding me, whispering. How much you care, a thousand violins fill the air. Now baby, baby, don't let this moment end keep standing. Close to me ooh, so close to me, baby, baby. Baby, baby, I hear a symphony, a tender melodyBaby don't go. Pretty baby please don't go. I never had a mother. I hardly knew my dad. I've been in town for eighteen years. You're the only boy I've had. I can't stay. Maybe I'll be back some day. Baby don't go. Pretty baby please don't go. I love you so. Pretty baby please don't go. I never had no money. I bought at the second hand store. The way this old town laughs at me. I just can't take it no more. I can't stay. I'm gonna be a lady some day. Baby don't go. Pretty baby please don't go. I love you so. Pretty baby please don't go. When I get to the city. My tears will all be dry. My eyes will look so pretty. No one's gonna know I cried. Yes I'm goin' away. Maybe I'll be back some day. Baby don't go. Maybe I'll be back some day. Baby don't go. Maybe I'll be back some dayTook a walk and passed your house late last night. All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight. From within, the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade. Oh, what a lovely couple they made. . Put his arms around your waist, held you tight. Kisses I could almost taste in the night. Wondered why I'm not the guy who's silhouette's on the shade. I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes. . Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. . Lost control and rang your bell; I was sore. Let me in, or else I'll beat down your door. When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade. Said, to my shock, "You're on the wrong block.". . Rushed out to your house with wings on my feet. Loved you like I'd never loved you, my sweet. Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade. All of our days, two silhouettes on the shade. . Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah[Instrumental]Sick at heart and lonely. Deep in dark despair. Thinking one thought only. "Where is she, tell me where?". And if she says to you. She don't love me. Please give her my message. Tell her of my plea. And I know. That if she had me back again. I would never make her sad. I've got a heart full of soul. And I know. That if she had me back again. I would never make her sad. I've got a heart full of soul. She's been gone such a long time. Longer than I can bear. But if she says she wants me. Tell her that I'll be there. And if she says to you. She don't love me. Please give her my message. Tell her of my plea. And I know. That if she had me back again. I would never make her sad. I've got a heart full of soulHere they come again, mmmm-mm-mm. Catch us if you can, mmmm-mm-mm. Time to get a move on, mmmm-mm-mm. We will yell with all of our might. Catch us if you can. Catch us if you can. Catch us if you can. Catch us if you can. Now we gotta run, mmmm-mm-mm.

I love her she loves me but I don't fit in her society. Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks. Ev'ry night I watch the lights from the house up on the hill. I love a little girl who lives up there and I guess I always will. But I don't dare knock on her door. 'Cause her daddy is my boss man. So I have to try to be content. Just to see her when ever I can. Down in the boondocks. Down in the boondocks. People put me down 'cause. That's the side of town I was born in. I love her she loves me but I don't fit in her society. Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks. Down in the boondocks. Down in the boondocks. One fine day I'll find the way to move from this old shack. I'll hold my head up like a king and I never never will look back. Until that morning I'll work and slave. And I'll save ev'ry dime. But tonight she'll have to steal away. To see me one more time. Down in the boondocks. Down in the boondocks. People put me down 'cause. That's the side of town I was born in. I love her she loves me but I don't fit in her society. Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks. Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocks. Lord have mercy on the boy from down in the boondocksDo you believe in magic?. In a young girls heart. How the music can free her. whenever it starts. And it's magic. if the music is groovy. It makes you feel happy like an old time movie. I'll tell ya about the magic. It'll free your soul. but it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout rock n roll. If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose. If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues. Just go and listen. It'll start with a smile. It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try. Your feet start tapping. And you can't seem to find. How you got there. So just blow your mind. If you believe in magic. Come along with me. We'll dance until morning, just you and me. and maybe, if the music is right. I'll meet ya tomorrow. so late at night. We'll go a dancin' baby then you'll see. all the magic's in the music and the music's in me, yeah. Do you belive in magic? Yeah.. Believe in the magic in a young girl's soul. believe in the magic of rock n roll. Believe in the magic that can set you free. Ohhhh, talkin' bout magic. Do you believe like I believe?. Do you believe in magic?A month of nights, a year of days. Octobers drifting into Mays. I set my sail when the tide comes in. And I just cast my fate to the wind.. I shift my course along the breeze. Won't sail up wind on memories. The empty sky is my best friend. And I just cast my fate to the wind. That time has a way of changing a man throughout the years. And now I'm rearranging my life through all my tears. Alone, alone, alone. There never was, there couldn't be. A place in time for men like me. Who'd drink the dark and laugh at day. And let their wildest dreams blow away. That time has a way of changing a man throughout the years. And now I'm rearranging my life through all my tears. Alone, alone, alone. So now I'm old, I'm wise, I'm smart. I'm just a man with half a heart. I wonder how it might have been. And I hadn't cast my fate to the wind. To the wind, to the wind.I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth. You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth. She's got a pad down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine. Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion Number Nine. I told her that I was a flop with chicks. I'd been this way since 1956. She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign. She said, "What you need is Love Potion Number Nine". She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink. She said, "I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink". It smelled like turpentine, it looked like India ink. I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink. I didn't know if it was day or night. I started kissin' everything in sight. But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine. He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine. I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink. I didn't know if it was day or night. I started kissin' everything in sight. But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine. He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine. Love Potion Number Nine, Love Potion Number Nine.

Yellow submarine, yellow submarineHello darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again. Because a vision softly creeping. Left its seeds while I was sleeping. And the vision that was planted in my brain. Still remains within the sound of silence. In restless dreams, I walked alone. Narrow streets of cobblestone. 'Neath the halo of a street lamp. I turned my collar to the cold and damp. When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light. That split the night and touched the sound of silence. And in the naked light, I saw. Ten thousand people, maybe more. People talking without speaking. People hearing without listening. People writing songs that voices never share. And no one dare disturb the sound of silence. "Fools" said I, you do not know. Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words, that I might teach you. Take my arms, that I might reach you. But my words like silent raindrops fell. And echoed in the wells of silence. And the people bowed and prayed. To the neon God they made. And the sign flashed out its warning. In the words that it was forming. And the sign said, "The words of the Prophets. Are written on the subway walls and tenement halls". And whispered in the sounds of silenceI see a red door and I want it painted black.. No colours anymore, I want them to turn black.. I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes. I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.. I see a line of cars and they're all painted black. With flowers and my love both never to come back.. I see people turn their heads and quickly look away.. Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day.. I look inside myself and see my heart is black.. I see my red door and must have it painted black.. Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts. It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black.. No more will my green segel turn a deeper blue.. I could not foresee this thing happening to you.. If I look hard enough into the settin' sun. My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes.. I see a red door and I want it painted black.. No colours anymore, I want them to turn black.. I see the girls go by dressed in their summer clothes. I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.. Hmm.... I wanna see your face painted black.. Black as night, black as coal.. I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky.. I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black, yeah!. Hmm...Ba-da ba-da-da-da. Ba-da ba-da-da-da.

Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city. All around, people looking half dead. Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head. But at night it's a different world. Go out and find a girl. Come on, come on and dance all night. Despite the heat it'll be alright. And babe, don't you know it's a pity. That the days can't be like the nights. In the summer, in the city. In the summer, in the city. Cool town, evening in the city. Dressing so fine and looking so pretty. Cool cat, looking for a kitty. Gonna look in every corner of the city. Till I'm wheezing like a bus stop. Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop. But at night, it's a different world. Go out and find a girl. Come on, come on and dance all night. Despite the heat, it'll be alright. And babe, don't you know it's a pity. That the days can't be like the nights. In the summer, in the city. In the summer, in the city. Hot town, summer in the city. Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty. Been down, isn't it a pity?. Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city. All around, people looking half dead. Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head. But at night, it's a different world. Go out and find a girl. Come on, come on and dance all night. Despite the heat, it'll be alright. And babe, don't you know it's a pity. That the days can't be like the nights. In the summer, in the city. In the summer, in the cityNo milk today, my love has gone away. The bottle stands for lorn, a symbol of the dawn. No milk today, it seems a common sight. But people passing by don't know the reason why. How could they know just what this message means?. The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams. How could they know the palace there had been. Behind the door where my love reigned as queen?. No milk today, it wasn't always so. The company was gay, we'd turn night into day. But all that's left is a place dark and lonely. A terraced house in a mean street back of town. Becomes a shrine when I think of you only. Just two up two down. No milk today, it wasn't always so. The company was gay, we'd turn night into day. As music played the faster did we dance. We felt it both at once, the start of our romance. How could they know just what this message means. The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams. How could they know a palace there had been. Behind the door where my love reigned as queen?. No milk today, my love has gone away. The bottle stands for love, a symbol of the dawn. But all that's left is a place dark and lonely. A terraced house in a mean street back of town. Becomes a shrine when I think of you only. Just two up two down. No milk today, my love has gone away. The bottle stands for love, a symbol of the dawn. No milk today, it seems a common sight.

Behind the door where my love reigned as queen?. No milk today, it wasn't always so. The company was gay, we'd turn night into day. But all that's left is a place dark and lonely. A terraced house in a mean street back of town. Oh, all that's left is a place dark and lonely. A terraced house in a mean street back of town. Oh, all that's left is a place dark and lonely. A terraced house in a mean street back of town. SONGWRITERS. GOULDMAN, GRAHAMBlack is black. I want my baby back.. It's grey, it's grey. since she went away. Oh-oh, what can I do?. 'cause I-I-I-I-I.

Everybody's hustlin' a-just to have a little scene. When I say we'll be cool, I think that you know what I mean. We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when?. I know a beach where, baby, a-it never ends. When you've made your mind up forever to be mine. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind.

Bang bang, I hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, my baby shot me down. Seasons came and changed the time. When I grew up, I called him mine. He would always laugh and say. "Remember when we used to play?". Bang bang, I shot you down. Bang bang, you hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, I used to shoot you down. Music played and people sang. Just for me the church bells rang. Now he's gone, I don't know why. And 'till this day, sometimes I cry. He didn't even say goodbye. He didn't take the time to lie. Bang bang, he shot me down. Bang bang, I hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, my baby shot me downI'm her yesterday man. well my friends that's what I am. I'm her yesterday man. well my friends that's what I am. that's what I am her yesterday man.

To ease my mind. I need to find, find. Someone to call mine. But mama said. "You can't hurry love. No, you just have to wait". She said, "Love don't come easy. It's a game of give and take". You can't hurry love. No, you just have to wait. You got to trust, give it time. No matter how long it takes. But how many heartaches. Must I stand before. I find a love. To let me live again. Right now the only thing. That keeps me hangin' on. When I feel my strength, yeah. It's almost gone. I remember mama said. "No, you just have to wait". She said, "Love don't come easy. It's a game of give and take". How long must I wait?. How much more can I take. Before loneliness will cause my heart. Heart to break?. No I can't bear to live my life alone. I grow impatient for a love to call my own. But when I feel that I, I can't go on. These precious words keeps me hangin' on. I remember mama said. "No, you just have to wait". She said, "Love don't come easy. It's a game of give and take". You can't hurry love. No, you just have to wait. She said, "Trust, give it time. No matter how long it takes". No, love, love, don't come easy. But I keep on waiting. Anticipating for that soft voice. To talk to me at night. For some tender arms. To hold me tight. I keep waiting, I keep on waiting. But it ain't easy, it ain't easy. But mama said. "You can't hurry love. No, you just have to wait". She said, "To trust, give it time. No matter how long it takes". You can't hurry love. No, you just have to wait. She said, "Love don't come easy. It's a game of give and take"See the girl with cymbals on her fingers. Entering through the door. Ruby glistening from her navel. Shimmering around the floor. Bells on feet go, ting a ling a linging. Going through my head. Sweat is falling just-a-like-a tear drops. Running from her head. Now she dancing, going through the movements. Swaying to and fro. Body moving, bringing back a memory. Thoughts of long ago. Blood is rushing, temperature is rising. Sweating from my brow. Like a snake, her body fascinates me. I can’t look away now. Stop, stop, stop all the dancing. Give me time to breathe. Stop, stop, stop all the dancing. Or I’ll have to leave. Now, she’s moving all around the tables. Luring all in sight. But I know that she cannot see me. Hidden by the light. Closer, closer, she is getting nearer. Soon she’ll be in reach. As I enter into a spotlight. She stands lost for speech. Stop, stop, stop all the dancing. Give me time to breathe. Stop, stop, stop all the dancing. Or I’ll have to leave. Stop, stop, stop all the dancing. Give me time to breathe. Stop, stop, stop all the dancing. Or I’ll have to leave. Now I hold her, people are staring. Don’t know what to think. And we struggle knocking over tables. Spilling all the drinks. Can’t they understand that I want her?. Happens every week. Heavy hand upon my collar. Throws me in the street. Stop, stop, stop all the dancing. Give me time to breathe. Stop, stop, stop all the dancing. Or I’ll have to leave, leaveLittle man. When you stand by my side. Then I know I don't have. To hide from anyone. And I pray that. We'll stay just that way. Till the day comes along. When we catch the sun. Little girl, you're runnin'. Come catch my hand, I'm near you. Little girl, you're singin'. Come close to me, I hear you. You're growin' old. My mother's cold. Now it's time that you learned. What it meant to be mature. There's no such place. As make believe. But when I look at your face. I'm not so sure. Little girl, you're runnin'. Come catch my hand, I'm near you. Little girl, you're singin'. Come close to me, I hear you. You and me is what I see. And that's the way. It's gonna stay. And it will always be. So little man. Please understand. That in this world with all its land. You're all I see. Little girl, you're runnin'.

She found fame and made her name. A hollywood director came into town. And said to her. "How'd you like to be a star?". "You're a girl that could go far". "'specially dressed the way you are". She smiled at him. Gave her pretty head a shake. That was Lady G's mistake. A-hey-hey-hey. Lady Godiva. He directs certificate 'X'. And people now are craning their necks. To see her. 'cause she's a star. One that everybody knows. Finished with the striptease shows. Now she can't afford her clothes. Her long blonde hair. Lyin' on the barber's floor. Doesn't need it long anymore.

And even if time ain't really on my side. It's one of those days for taking a walk outside. I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun. And fall on my face on somebody's new-mown lawn. I've been having a sweet dream. I been dreaming since I woke up today. It's starring me and my sweet thing. 'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way. And even if time is passing me by a lot. I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got. Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load. A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull dog. And you can be sure that if you're feeling right. A daydream will last long into the night. Tomorrow at breakfast you may pick up your ears. Or you may be daydreaming for a thousand years. What a day for a daydream.

When you're close to me, I can feel your heart beat . I can hear you breathing near my ear . Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me got a groovy kind of love . Anytime you want to you can turn me onto . Anything you want to, anytime at all . When I kiss your lips, ooh I start to shiver . Can't control the quivering inside . Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me got a groovy kind of love, oh . When I'm feeling blue, all I have to do . Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue . When I'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter . My whole world could shatter, I don't care .

Come on, come on, come on and dance with me. Oh Sweet Pea, won't you be my girl?. Won't you? Won't you? Won't you be my girl?. I went to a dance just the other night. I saw a girl there she was out of sight. I asked a friend of mine who she could be. He said that her friends just call her Sweet Pea. Oh Sweet Pea, come on and dance with me. Come on, come on, come on and dance with me. Oh Sweet Pea, won't you be my girl?. Won't you? Won't you? Won't you be my girl?. I walked on over and asked her to dance. Thinkin' maybe later of makin' romance. But every guy there was thinkin' like me. I had to stand in line to get a dance with Sweet Pea. Oh Sweet Pea, come on and dance with me. Come on, come on, come on and dance with me. Oh Sweet Pea, won't you be my girl?. Won't you? Won't you? Won't you be my girl?. I finally got to whisper sweet words in her ear. Convinced her that we oughta get away from there. We took a little walk I held her close to me. And underneath the stars I said to Sweet Pea. Oh Sweet Pea I love you can't you see. Love you, love you, love you can't you see. Oh Sweet Pea, won't you be my girl?. Won't you? Won't you? Won't you be my girl?Good lovin'. Good lovin'. Good lovin'. Good lovin'. I was feelin' so bad.

In a deep and dark December. I am alone. Gazing from my window. To the streets below. On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow. I am a rock. I am an island. I've built walls. A fortress steep and mighty. That none may penetrate. I have no need of friendship. Friendship causes pain. It's laughter and it's loving I disdain. I am a rock. I am an island. Don't talk of love. Well I've heard the word before. It's sleeping in my memory. I won't disturb the slumber. Of feelings that have died. If I never loved, I never would have cried. I am a rock. I am an island. I have my books. And my poetry to protect me. I am shielded in my armor. Hiding in my room. Safe within my womb. I touch no one, and no one touches me. I am a rock. I am an island. And a rock feels no pain. And an island never criesOn our block all of the guys call her flamingo. Cause her hair glows like the sun. And her eyes can light the skies. When she walks she moves so fine like a flamingo. Crimson dress that clings so tight. She's out of reach and out of sight. When she walks by she brightens up the neighborhood. Oh every guy would make her his if he just could. If she just would. Some sweet day I'll make her mine pretty flamingo. Then every guy will envy me. Cause paradise is where I'll be. Pretty flamingo. Pretty flamingo. When she walks by she brightens up the neighborhood. Oh every guy would make her his if he just could. If she just would. Some sweet day I'll make her mine pretty flamingo. Then every guy will envy me. Cause paradise is where I'll be. Sha la la la la la la pretty flamingo. Some day I'll make her mine. Yes, I will. Yes, I will. Sha la la la la la laI'll be alone each and every night. While you're away, don't forget to write. Bye-bye, so long, farewell. Bye-bye, so long. See you in September.

You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you. You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you. You don't know how many times I've wished that I could mold you. Into someone who could cherish me as much as I cherish you. Perish is the word that more than applies. To the hope in my heart each time I realize. That I am not gonna be the one to share your dreams. That I am not gonna be the one to share your schemes. That I am not gonna be the one to share what seems to be. The life that you could cherish as much as I do yours. Oh, I'm beginning to think that man has never found. The words that could make you want me. That have the right amount of letters, just the right sound. That could make you hear, make you see. That you are driving me out of my mind. Oh, I could say I need you, but then you'd realize. That I want you, just like a thousand other guys. Who'd say they loved you with all the rest of their lies. When all they wanted was to touch your face, your hands. And gaze into your eyes. Cherish is the word I use to describe. All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside. You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you. You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you. You don't know how many times I've wished that I could mold you. Into someone who could cherish me as much as I cherish you.

To take us over the road. Man made the train. To carry the heavy load. Man made the electric light. To take us out of the dark. Man made the boat for the water. Like Noah made the ark. This is a man's, man's, man's world. But it would be nothing. Nothing. without a woman or a girl. Man thinks about a little bit of baby girls. and a baby boys. Man make them happy. 'Cause man make them toys. And after man made everything, everything he can. You know that man makes money. to buy from other man. This is a man's world. But it would be nothing, nothing. Not one little thing. Without a woman or a girl. He's lost in the wilderness. He's lost in bitterness. He's lostI'm sittin' in the railway station. Got a ticket for my destination. On a tour of one night stands. My suitcase and guitar in hand. And every stop is neatly planned. For a poet and a one man band. Homeward bound. I wish I was. Homeward bound. Home, where my thought's escapin'. Home, where my music's playin'. Home, where my love lies waitin'. Silently for me. Everyday's an endless stream. Of cigarettes and magazines. And each town looks the same to me. The movies and the factories. And every stranger's face I see. Reminds me that I long to be. Homeward bound. I wish I was. Homeward bound. Home, where my thought's escapin'. Home, where my music's playin'. Home, where my love lies waitin'. Silently for me. Tonight I'll sing my songs again. I'll play the game and pretend. But all my words come back to me. In shades of mediocrity. Like emptiness in harmony. I need someone to comfort me. Homeward bound. I wish I was. Homeward bound. Home, where my thought's escapin'. Home, where my music's playin'. Home, where my love lies waitin'. Silently for me. Silently for meWho's that I see walkin' in these woods. Why, it's Lil' Red Riding Hood. Hey there, Lil' Red Riding Hood. You sure are looking good. You're everything a big bad wolf could want. Listen to me. Lil' Red Riding Hood. I don't think little big girls should.

What full lips you have. They're sure to lure someone bad. So until you get to grandma's place. I think you ought to walk with me and be safe. I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on. Until I'm sure that you've been shown. That I can be trusted walking with you alone. Lil' Red Riding Hood. I'd like to hold you if I could. But you might think I'm a big bad wolf so I won't. What a big heart I have. The better to love you with. Lil' Red Riding Hood. Even bad wolves can be good. I'll try to be satisfied. Just to walk close by your side. Maybe you'll see things my way.

You're old enough to know the makings of a man. Listen to me, baby, it's hard to settle down. Am I asking too much for you to stick around?. Every boy wants a girl. He can trust to the very end. Baby, that's you. Won't you wait? But 'til then. When I see lips beggin' to be kissed. (Stop). I can't stop. (Stop). I can't stop myself.   (Stop, stop). Lightning's striking again. Lightning's striking again. Nature's takin' over my one-track mind. Believe it or not, you're in my heart all the time. All the girls are sayin' that you'll end up a fool. For the time being, baby, live by my rules. When I settle down. I want one baby on my mind. Forgive and forget. And I'll make up for all lost time. If she's put together fine. And she's readin' my mind. (Stop). I can't stop. (Stop). I can't stop myself.   (Stop, stop). Lightning's striking again. Lightning's striking again. And again and again and again.

Somewhere, My Love . From the Movie "Doctor Zivago" . µçÓ°[ÆëÍß¸çÒ½Éú]²åÇú . Ray Conniff . Somewhere, my love . There will be songs to sing . Although the snow . Covers the hope of spring . Somewhere a hill . Blossoms in green and gold . And there are dreams . All that your heart can hold . Someday we'll meet again, my lov . Someday whenever the spring breaks through . You'll come to me out of the long ago . Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow . Till then my sweet . Think of me now and then . God speed my love till you are mine again . Now on my own, think of me now and then . God speed my love till you are mine againWhen I said, I needed you. You said you would always stay. It wasn't me who changed, but you. And now you've gone away. Don't you see that now you've gone. And I'm left here on my own. And that I have to follow you. And beg you to come home. You don't have to say you love me. Just be close at hand. You don't have to stay forever. I will understand. Believe me, believe me. I can't help but love you. But believe me, I'll never tie you down. Left alone with just a memory. Life seems dead and so unreal. All that's left is loneliness. There's nothing left to feel. You don't have to say you love me. Just be close at hand. You don't have to stay forever. I will understand. Believe me, believe me. You don't have to say you love me. Just be close at hand. You don't have to stay forever. I will understand. Believe me, believe me. Believe meLoneliness.

I can't go on. (Repeat Chorus, but add an extra. 'The sun ain't gonna shine anymore'. after 3rd line). The sun ain't gonna shine anymore. (Repeat till fade)As I walk this land of broken dreams. I have visions of many things. But happiness is just an illusion. Filled with sadness and confusion. What becomes of the brokenhearted. Who had love that's now departed?. I know I've got to find. Some kind of peace of mind, maybe. The roots of love grow all around. But for me they come a-tumblin' down. Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger. I can't stand this pain much longer. I walk in shadows searching for light. Cold and alone, no comfort in sight. Hoping and praying for someone who cares. Always moving and goin' nowhere. What becomes of the brokenhearted. Who had love that's now departed?. I know I've got to find. Some kind of peace of mind, help me please. I'm searching though I don't succeed. But someone look, there's a growing need. All is lost, there's no place for beginning. All that's left is an unhappy ending. Now what becomes of the brokenhearted. Who had love that's now departed?. I know I've got to find. Some kind of peace of mind. I'll be searching everywhere. Just to find someone to care. I'll be looking everyday. I know I'm gonna find a way. Nothing's gonna stop me now. I know I'll find a way somehow. I'll be searching everywhereGuantanamera, guajira guantanamera. Guantanamera, guajira guantanamera. Yo soy un hombre sincero. De don de crece la palma.

And when I see the sign that points one way . The lot we used to pass by every day . . CHORUS 1: . Just walk away, Renee . You won't see me follow you back home . The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same . You're not to blame . . From deep inside the tears that I'm forced to cry . From deep inside the pain that I chose to hide . . CHORUS 2: . Just walk away, Renee . You won't see me follow you back home . Now, as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes, . For me, it cries . . FLUTE SOLO . . CHORUS 2 . . Your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall . Still finds a way to haunt me though they're so small . . CHORUS 1They seek him here, they seek him there. His clothes are loud, but never square. It will make or break him so he's got to buy the best. 'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion. . And when he does his little rounds. 'Round the boutiques of London Town. Eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends. 'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion. . Oh yes he is, oh yes he is. (Oh yes he is, oh yes he is). He thinks he is a flower to be looked at. And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight. He feels a dedicated follower of fashion. . Oh yes he is, oh yes he is. (Oh yes he is, oh yes he is). There's one thing that he loves and that is flattery. One week he's in polka-dots, the next week he is in stripes. 'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion. . They seek him here, they seek him there. In Regent Street and Leicester Square. Everywhere the Carnabetian army marches on. Each one an dedicated follower of fashion. . Oh yes he is, oh yes he is. (Oh yes he is, oh yes he is). His world is built 'round discotheques and parties. This pleasure-seeking individual always looks his best. 'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion. . Oh yes he is, oh yes he is. (Oh yes he is, oh yes he is). He flits from shop to shop just like a butterfly. In matters of the cloth he is as fickle as can be. 'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion. . He's a dedicated follower of fashion. He's a dedicated follower of fashionA-breakin' rocks in the hot sun. I fought the law and the law won. I fought the law and the law won. I needed money 'cause I had none. I fought the law and the law won. I fought the law and the law won. I left my baby and I feel so sad. I guess my race is run. Well, she's the best girl I've ever had. I fought the law and the law won. I fought the law and the law won. A-robbin' people with a six-gun. I fought the law and the law won. I fought the law and the law won. I miss my baby and-a good fun.

I fought the law and the law won. I fought the law and the law wonDid you ever have to make up your mind?. You pick up on one and leave the other one behind. It's not often easy and not often kind. Did you ever have to make up your mind?. Did you ever have to finally decide?. And say yes to one and let the other one ride. There's so many changes and tears you must hide. Did you ever have to finally decide?. Sometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, cute as a bunny. With hair down to here and plenty of money. And just when you think she's that one in the world. Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl. And then you know you better make up your mind. And pick up on one and leave the other one behind. It's not often easy and not often kind. Did you ever have to make up your mind?. Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her. And then you get distracted by her older sister. When in walks her father and takes you in line. And says, "Better go home, son, and make up your mind". Then you bet you'd better finally decide. And say yes to one and let the other one ride. There's so many changes and tears you must hide. Did you ever have to finally decide?OH NO!. (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba). I can't stand still coz youve got me goin. (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba).

I've got this feeling thats inside of me. It makes me think of how things used to be. It makes me feel alright. When I'm with you at night. And we love. And we love. (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba). You fill me so with this big temptation. (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba). This kind of feeling could move a nation. (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba).

And though she's not really ill, there's a little yellow pill. She goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper. And it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day. "Things are different today," I hear every mother say. Cooking fresh food for her husband's just a drag. So she buys an instant cake, and she burns a frozen steak. And goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper. And two help her on her way, get her through her busy day. Doctor, please, some more of these. Outside the door, she took four more. What a drag it is getting old. "Men just aren't the same today," I hear every mother say. They just don't appreciate that you get tired. They're so hard to satisfy, you can tranquilize your mind. So go running for the shelter of a mother's little helper. And four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight. Doctor, please, some more of these. Outside the door, she took four more. What a drag it is getting old. "Life's just much too hard today," I hear every mother say. The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore. And if you take more of those, you will get an overdose. No more running for the shelter of a mother's little helper. They just helped you on your way, through your busy dying day. HeyThe more I see you, . The more I want you.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar. The little children laugh at him behind his back. And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain. Very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. Here beneath the blue suburban skies. I sit and meanwhile back in. Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass. And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen. He likes to keep his fire engine clean. It's a clean machine. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. For a fish and finger pie. In summer meanwhile back. Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout. A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray. And though she feels as if she's in a play. She is anyway. Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer. We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim. And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain. Very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies. I sit and meanwhile back. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies.

And if we go someplace to dance. I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me. And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place. And have a drink or two.... And then I go and spoil it all by saying. Something stupid like I love you. I can see it in your eyes that you despise. The same old lines you heard the night before.... And though it's just a line to you for me it's true.... And never seemed so right before. I practice everyday to find some clever lines. To say to make the meaning come true.... But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late. And I'm alone with you. The time is right your perfume fills my head.... The stars get red and on the nights so blue.... And then I go and spoil it all by saying. Something stupid like I love you. SONGWRITERS. HART, LORENZ / RODGERS, RICHARDLet me take you down. â€~Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.

I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay. And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat. And Mama hollered out the back door "Y'all remember to wipe your feet". And then she said "I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge". "Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge". And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas. "Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please". "There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow". And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow. Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge. And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge. And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe. Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show. And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?. "I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right". "I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge". "And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge". And Mama said to me "Child, what's happened to your appetite?". "I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite". "That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today". "Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way". "He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge". "And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge". A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe. And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo. There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring. And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything. And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge. And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie BridgeOne pill makes you larger. And one pill makes you small. And the ones that mother gives you. Don't do anything at all. Go ask Alice. When she's ten feet tall. . And if you go chasing rabbits. And you know you're going to fall. Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar. Has given you the call. To call Alice. When she was just small. . When the men on the chessboard. Get up and tell you where to go. And you've just had some kind of mushroom. And your mind is moving low. Go ask Alice. I think she'll know. . When logic and proportion. Have fallen slowly dead. And the White Knight is talking backwards. And the Red Queen's off with her head. Remember what the dormouse said.

After the turn of the century. In the clear blue skies over Germany. Came a roar and a thunder men had never heard. Like the scream and the sound of a big war bird. Up in the sky, a man in a plane. Baron von Richthofen was his name. Eighty men tried, and eighty men died. Now they're buried together on the countryside. .  Chorus:. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more. The Bloody Red Baron was rollin' out the score. Eighty men died tryin' to end that spree. Of the Bloody Red Baron of Germany. . In the nick of time, a hero arose. A funny-looking dog with a big black nose. He flew into the sky to seek revenge. But the Baron shot him down--"Curses, foiled again!". .  (chorus). . Now, Snoopy had sworn that he'd get that man. So he asked the Great Pumpkin for a new battle plan. He challenged the German to a real dogfight. While the Baron was laughing, he got him in his sight. . That Bloody Red Baron was in a fix. He'd tried everything, but he'd run out of tricks. Snoopy fired once, and he fired twice. And that Bloody Red Baron went spinning out of sight. .  (chorus, to fade). . "Snoopy vs. The Red Baron," The Royal GuardsmenDon't you worry 'bout what's on your mind, oh my.

Your multilingual business friend. Has packed her bags and fled. Leaving only ash-filled ashtrays. And the lipstick, unmade bed. The mirror, on reflection. Has climbed back upon the wall. For the floor she found descended. And the ceiling was too tall. . Your trouser cuffs are dirty. And your shoes are laced up wrong. You'd better take off your Homburg. 'Cause your overcoat is too long. . Town clock in the market square. Stands waiting for the hour. When its hands they both turn backward. And on meeting will devour. Both themselves and also any fool. Who dares to tell the time. And the sun and moon will shadow. And the signpost cease to sign. . Your trouser cuffs are dirty. And your shoes are laced up wrong. You'd better take off your Homburg. 'Cause your overcoat is too longWell, my pad is very messy. And there's whiskers on my chin. And I'm all hung up on music. And I always play to win. I ain't got no time for lovin'. 'Cause my time is all used up. Just to sit around creatin'. All that groovy kind of stuff. But I'm a man, yes I am. And I can't help. But love you so. But I'm a man, yes I am. And I can't help. But love you so. Well, if I had my choice of matter. I would rather be with cats. All engrossed in mental chatter. Movin' where our minds are at. And relatin' to each other. Just how strong our wills can be. I'm resisting all involvement. With each groovy chick we see. Well, I'm a man, yes I am. And I can't help. But love you so. But I'm a man, yes I am. And I can't help. But love you so. I got to keep my image. While suspended from a throne. That looks out upon a kingdom. Full of people all unknown. Who imagine I'm not human. And my heart is made of stone. I never had no problems. And my toilet's trimmed with chrome. I'm a man, yes I am. And I can't help. But love you so. I'm a man, yes I am. And I can't help. But love you soThrough the mirror of my mind, time after time. I see reflections of you and me. Reflections of the way life used to be. Reflections of the love you took from me. Oh, I'm all alone now, no love to shield me. Trapped in a world that's a distorted reality. Happiness you took from me. And left me alone with only memories. Through the mirror of my mind. Through these tears that I'm crying. Reflects a hurt I can't control. 'Cause although you're gone, I keep holding on. To the happy times, oh, when you were mine. As I peer through the window of lost time. Looking over my yesterdays. And all the love I gave all in vain. All the love that I've waisted. All the tears that I've tasted, all in vain. Through the hollow of my tears I see a dream that's lost. From the hurt that you have caused. Everywhere I turn, seems like everything I see. Reflects the love that used to be. In you I put all my faith and trust. Right before my eyes, my world has turned to dust. After all the nights I sat alone and wept. Just a handful of promises are all that's left of loving you. Reflections of the way life used to be. Reflections of the love you took from me. In you I put all my faith and trust. Right before my eyes, my world has turned to dustHey life look at me, I can see the reality. 'Cause when you shook me, took me out of my world. I woke up, suddenly I just woke up, to the happening. When you find that you left the future behind. 'Cause when you got a tender love. You don't take care of then you better beware of the happening. One day you're up, then you turn around. You find your world is tumbling down. It happened to me and it can happen to you. I was sure, I felt secure, until love took a detour. Yeah, I'm riding high on top of the world. It happened, suddenly it just happened. I saw my dreams fall apart when love walked away from my heart. And when you lose that precious love you need to guide you. Something happens inside you, the happening. Now I see life for what it is. It's not all dreams, ooh it's not all bliss. It happened to me and it can happen to you once. Ooh, and then it happened. Ooh, and then it happened. Ooh, and then it happened. Ooh, and then it happened. Is it real, is it fake, is this game of life a mistake. 'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine. For certain, suddenly I started hurting. I saw the light too late, when that fickle finger of fate. Yeah came and broke my pretty balloon. I woke up, suddenly I just walked up to the happening. So sure, I felt secure, until love took a detour. 'Cause when you got a tender love. You don't take care of, then you better beware of the happeningShe comes in colors ev'rywhere. She combs her hair. She's like a rainbow. Coming, colors in the air. Oh, everywhere. She comes in colors. She comes in colors ev'rywhere. She combs her hair. She's like a rainbow. Coming, colors in the air. Oh, everywhere. She comes in colors. Have you seen her dressed in blue?. See the sky in front of you. And her face is lik a sail. Speck of white so fair and pale. Have you seen a lady fairer?. She comes in colors ev'rywhere. She combs her hair. She's like a rainbow. Coming, colors in the air. Oh, everywhere. She comes in colors. Have you seen her all in gold?. Like a queen in days of old. She shoots her colors all around. Like a sunset going down. Have you seen a lady fairer?. She comes in colors ev'rywhere. She combs her hair. She's like a rainbow. Coming, colors in the air. Oh, everywhere. She comes in colors. She's like a rainbow. Coming, colors in the air. Oh, everywhere. She comes in colorsWhen I think of all the worries. That people seem to find. And how they're in a hurry. To complicate their minds. By chasing after money. And dreams that can't come true. I'm glad that we are different. We've better things to do. May others plan their future. I'm busy loving you. One, two, three, four. Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today. (Hey, hey, hey). Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today. And don't worry 'bout tomorrow, hey. Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today. Live for today. We were never meant to worry. The way that people do. And I don't need to hurry. As long as I'm with you. We'll take it nice and easy. And use my simple plan. You'll be my lovin' woman. I'll be your lovin' man. We'll take the most from living. Have pleasure while we can. Two, three, four. Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today. (Hey, hey, hey). Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today. And don't worry 'bout tomorrow, hey. Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today. Live for today. Baby, I need to feel you inside of me.

Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for todayLove is here and. Oh, my darling, now you're gone. Love is here and. Oh, my darling, now, now you're gone. You persuaded me to love you. And I did. But instead of tenderness. I found heartache instead. Into your arms I fell. So unaware of the loneliness. That was waiting there. You close the door to your heart. And you turned the key. Locked your love away from me. Love is here and. Oh, my darling, now you're gone. You made me love you. And oh, my darling, now you're gone. You said loving you would make life beautiful. With each passing day. But as soon as love came into my heart. You turned and you walked, just walked away. You stripped me of my dreams. You gave me faith, then took my hope. Look at me now. Look at me. See what loving you has done to me. Look at my face. See how cryin' has left it's trace. After you made me all your own. Then you left me all alone. You made your words sound so sweet. Knowing that your love I couldn't keep. My heart cries out for your touch. But you're not there. And the lonely cry fades in the air. Love is here and. Oh, my darling, now you're gone. Love is here and. Oh, my darling, now you're gone. You made me love you. Oh, my darling, now you're gone. You made me love you. Oh, my darling, now you're goneNow when you're feelin' low and the fish won't bite. You need a little bit o' soul to put you right. You gotta make like you wanna kneel and pray. And then a little bit o' soul will come your way. Now when your girl is gone and you're broke in two. You need a little bit o' soul to see you through. And when you raise the roof with your rock 'n' roll. You'll get a lot more kicks with a little bit o' soul. And when your party falls 'cause ain't nobody groovin'. A little bit o' soul and it really starts movin', yeah. And when you're in a mess and you feel like cryin'. Just remember this little song of mine. And as you go through life tryin' to reach your goal. Just remember what I said about a little bit o'soul. A little bit o' soul, yeah. (A little bit o' soul)I read the news today oh boy. About a lucky man who made the grade. And though the news was rather sad. Well I just had to laugh. I saw the photograph. He blew his mind out in a car. He didn't notice that the lights had changed. A crowd of people stood and stared. They'd seen his face before. Nobody was really sure. If he was from the House of Lords. I saw a film today oh boy. The English Army had just won the war. A crowd of people turned away. But I just had to look. Having read the book. I'd love to turn you on. Woke up, fell out of bed. Dragged a comb across my head. Found my way downstairs and drank a cup. And looking up I noticed I was late. Found my coat and grabbed my hat. Made the bus in seconds flat. Found my way upstairs and had a smoke. And somebody spoke and I went into a dream. I read the news today oh boy. Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire. And though the holes were rather small. They had to count them all. Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall. I'd love to turn you onHey Joe, where you goin' with that gun in your hand?.

His arms and legs don't feel so strong. His heart is weak, there's something wrong. Opens windows in despair. Tries to breathe in some fresh air. His conscience cries, "Get on your feet. Without you, Jack, the town can't eat".. Grocer Jack, Grocer Jack, get off your back,. go into town, don't let them down, oh no, no.. Grocer Jack, Grocer Jack, get off your back,. go into town, don't let them down, oh no, no.. The people that live in the town,. don't understand - he's never been known to miss his round.. It's ten o'clock, the housewives yell. "When Jack turns up, we'll give him hell".. Husbands moan at breakfast tables, no milk, no eggs, no marmalade labels.. Mothers send their children out, to Jack's house to scream and shout.. It's Sunday morning, bright and clear,. lovely flowers decorate a marble square.. People cry and mourn away, think about the fateful day,. Now they wish they'd given Jack more affection and respect,. The little children, dressed in black, don't know what's happened to old Jack.. SECOND. Grocer Jack, Grocer Jack, is it true what Mummy said,. you won't come back. oh no, no.. (rep. and fade)Maybe you'll wanna give me kisses sweet<br />. But only for one night with no repeat<br />. And maybe you'll go away and never call<br />. And a taste of honey's worse than none at all<br />. <br />. Oh, little girl<br />.

And you don't have the time to hang around<br />. Or maybe you think that love's only made for fools<br />. And so it makes you wise to break the rules<br />. <br />. Oh, little girl<br />.

Ooh, little girl<br />. I second that emotion"Death Of A Clown". My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin. I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin. The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore.

Let's all drink to the death of a clown. Let's all drink to the death of a clown. The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor. Nobody needs fortunes told anymore. The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees. And frantically looking for runaway fleas. La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Let's all drink to the death of a clown. So won't someone help me to break up this crown. Let's all drink to the death of a clown. La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Let's all drink to the death of a clown.

The bloody Red Baron was flying once more. The Allied Command ignored all of its men. And called on Snoopy to do it again. . Was the night before Christmas and forty below. When Snoopy went up in search of his foe. He spied the Red Baron and fiercely they fought. With ice on his wings, Snoopy knew he was caught. Christmas bells those Christmas bells. Ring out from the land. Asking peace of all the world. And good will to man. . The Baron had Snoopy dead in his sights. He reached for the trigger to pull it up tight. Why he didn't shoot, well, we'll never know. Or was it the bells from the village below. {Refrain}. Christmas bells those Christmas bells. Ringing through the land. Bringing peace to all the world. And good will to man. The Baron made Snoopy fly to the Rhine. And forced him to land behind the enemy lines. Snoopy was certain that this was the end. When the Baron cried out "Merry Christmas, mein friend!". The Baron then offered a holiday toast. And Snoopy our hero saluted his host. And then with a roar they were both on their way. Each knowing they'd meet on some other day. {Refrain twice}Woke up one morning half asleep. With all my blankets in a heap. And yellow roses scattered all around. The time was still approaching four. I couldn't stand it anymore. Saw marigolds upon my eiderdown. I'm just sitting watching flowers in the rain. Feel the power of the rain making the garden grow. I'm just sitting watching flowers in the rain. Feel the power of the rain keeping me good. So I lay upon my side. With all the windows open wide. Couldn't pressurize my head from speaking. Hoping not to make a sound. I pushed my bed into the grounds. In time to catch the sight that I was seeking. (repeat). If this perfect pleasure has to be. Then this is paradise to me. If my pillow's getting wet. I don't see that it matters much to me. I heard the flowers in the breeze. Make conversation with the trees. Relieved to leave reality behind me. With my commitments in a mess. My sleep has gone away depressed. In a world of fantasy you'll find me. (repeat). Watching flowers in the rain. Flowers in the rain. Power flowers in the rain. Flower power in the rain. (fade out)You wander around. on your own little cloud. when you don't see the why. or the wherefore.. Ooh, you walk out on me. when we both disagree. 'cause to reason is not what you care for.. I've heard it all a million times before.. Take off your coat, my love, and close the door.. Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.. Don't stand in the pouring rain.. Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.. The night is long.. Forget your foolish pride.. Nothing's wrong,. now you're beside me again.. You try to be smart. then you take it apart. 'cause it hurts when your ego is deflated.. um-m-um-um-um-um. You don't realize. that it's all compromise. and the problems are so over-rated.. Good-bye means nothing when it's all for show.. So why pretend you've somewhere else to go?. Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.. Don't stand in the pouring rain.. Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'.. The night is long.. Forget your foolish pride.. Nothing's wrong,. now you're beside me again.. Oh, oh, oh.. Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'..

So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay. Watching the tide roll away. I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time. Look like nothing's gonna change. Everything still remains the same. I can't do what ten people tell me to do. So I guess I'll remain the same, listen. Sittin' here resting my bones. And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen. 2000 miles I've roamed.

Was just a twig.... Then the first snow came,. And she ran out to brush the snow away. So it wouldn't die.... Came runnin' in all excited. Slipped and almost hurt herself. And i laughed 'til i cried.... She was always young at heart. Kinda dumb, and kinda smart. And i loved her so.... And i surprised her with a puppy,. Kept me up all Christmas eve,. 2 years ago.... And it would sure embarrass her when i came in from workin' late,. Cause i would know.... That she'd been sittin there an' cryin',. Over some sad and silly late, late show.... And Honey, i miss you.... And i'm bein' good.... And i'd love to be with you.... If only i could.... She wrecked the car, and she was sad. And so afraid that i'd be mad,. But, what the heck?.... Though i pretended hard to be,. Guess you could say she saw through me,. And hugged my neck.... I came home unexpectedly,. And caught her cryin' needlessly, in the middle of the day.... And it was in the early spring, when flowers bloom, and robins sing,. She went away.... And Honey, i miss you.... And i'm bein' good.... And i'd love to be with you.... If only i could.... One day while i was not at home,. While she was there, and all alone,. The angels came.... Now all i have is memories of Honey. And i wake up nights,. And call her name....

As she deceived me I watched and went out of my mind. My, my, my, Delilah.. Why, why, why, Delilah?. I could see that girl was no good for me. But I was lost like a slave that no man could free. At break of day when that man drove away I was waiting. I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door. She stood there laughing. I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more. My, my, my, Delilah.. Why, why, why, Delilah?. So before they come to break down the door. Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take anymore. She stood there laughing.

But I can tell you people they were the devil's children. Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doin'. One lazy afternoon down Savannah way. They robbed a store. And high-tailed outa that town. Got clean away in a stolen car. And waited till the heat died down. Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation. And made the graduation into the banking business. "Reach for the sky," sweet-talking Clyde would holler. As Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag. Now one brave man. He tried to take 'em alone. They left him lyin' in a pool of blood. And laughed about it all the way home. Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one. Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun. They used to laugh about dyin'. But deep inside 'em they knew that pretty soon they'd be lyin'. Beneath the ground together. Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun and the morning dew. Acting upon reliable information. A federal deputation laid a deadly ambush. When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine. A half a dozen carbines opened up on them. Bonnie and Clyde, they lived a lot together. And finally together they diedLove is like candy on a shelf. You want to taste and help yourself. The sweetest things are there for you. Help yourself, take a few. That's what I want you to do..

Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings. Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes. Dawn light smiles on you leaving, my contentment. I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines. Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves. You said no strings could secure you at the station. Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows. I walked into such a sad time at the station. As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning. I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back. Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves. At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd. Consolation for the old wound now forgotten. Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes. She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings. I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd. Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselvesYou see this guy. This guy's in love with you. Yes, I'm in love. Who looks at you the way I do. When you smile I can tell. We know each other very well. How can I show you. I'm glad I got to know you, 'cause.

You think that I don't feel love. But what I feel for you is real love. In other's eyes I see reflected. A hurt, scorned, rejected. Love child, never meant to be. Love child, born in poverty. Love child, never meant to be. Love child, take a look at me. I started my life in an old, cold, run down tenement slum. My Father left, he never even married Mom. I shared the guilt my Mama knew. So afraid that others knew I had no name. This love we're contemplating. Isn't worth the pain of waiting. We'll only end up hating. The child we maybe creating. Love child, never meant to be. Love child, scorned by society. Love child, always second best. Love child, different from the rest. Hold on, hold on, just a little bit. Hold on, hold on, just a little bit. I started school, in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out. I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt. To be without the simple things. Sop afraid my friends would see the guilt in me. Don't think that I don't need you. Don't think I don't wanna please you. No child of mine will be bearing. The name of shame I've been wearing. Love child, love child, never quite as good. Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood. But I'll always love you. I'll always love you. I'll always love you. I'll always love you. I'll always love you. I'll always love you.

Now for once in your life you're alone. but you ain't got a dime, there's no time for the phone.". I've just got to get a message to you, hold on, hold on..

Of the Harper Valley PTA". "Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there. And seven times he asked me for a date. And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice. Whenever he's away". "And Mr. Baker, can you tell us. Why your secretary had to leave this town?. And shouldn't widow Jones be told. To keep her window shades all pulled completely down?". "Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here. 'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again. And if you'll smell Shirley Thompson's breath. You'll find she's had a little nip of gin". "And then you have the nerve to tell me. You think that as a mother I not fit. Well, this is just a little Payton Place. And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites". No, I wouldn't put you on.

They'd run around free while the earth was being born.. And the loveliest of them all was the unicorn.. . There were green alligators and long-necked geese.. Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.. Some cats and rats and elephants, as sure as you're born.. And the loveliest of them all was the unicorn.. . Now, God saw some sinning, and it gave him pain.. So he said, "Stand back, I'm going to make it rain.". He said, "Hey, Brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do:. Build me a floating zoo.. . And take some of them green alligators and long-necked geese.. Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.. Some cats and rats and elephants, as sure as you're born.. And don't you forget my unicorn.". . Old Noah was there to answer the call.. He finished up making the Ark just as the rain started falling.. He marched in the animals two by two,. And he called out as they went through,. . "Hey Lord, I got your green alligators and long-necked geese,. Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.. Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord, I'm so forlorn.. I just can't see no unicorn.". . Then Noah looked out through the driving rain.. Them unicorns were hiding, playing silly games.. Kicking and splashing while the rain was pourin'.. Oh them silly unicorn!. . There were green alligators and long-necked geese,. Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.. Noah cried, "Close the door, cause the rain is pourin'. And we just can't wait for no unicorn.". . The Ark started moving, it drifted with the tide.. The unicorns looked up from the rocks, and they cried.. And the waters came down and sort of floated them away.. And that's why you've never seen a unicorn, to this very day.. . You'll see green alligators and long-necked geese,. Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.. Some cats and rats and elephant, but sure as you're born,. You're never gonna see no unicorn.Well Lord, I've got to raise a fuss. Lord, I've got to raise a holler. About a workin' all summer. Just to try to earn a dollar. Well Lord, I try to call my baby.

I say hey, and the time is right for a palace revolution. But where I live the game to play is compromise solution. Well, what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock 'n' Roll band. 'Cause in sleepy London town there's just no place for. A street fighting man, no. I say hey, and my name is called Disturbance. I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants. Well what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock 'n' Roll band. 'Cause in sleepy London town there's just no place for. A street fighting man, I know. I know, hey baby. I know, I knowAnd I wake up in the mornin'. With my hair down in my eyes and she says, "Hi". And I stumble to the breakfast table. While the kids are goin' off to school…goodbye. And she reaches out and takes my hand. And squeezes it and says, "How ya feelin', hon?". And I look across at smilin' lips. That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun. And if that's not lovin' me. Then all I've got to say. God didn't make little green apples. And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime. And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss. Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme. God didn't make little green apples. And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime. And when myself is feelin' low. I think about her face aglow and ease my mind. Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy. And ask her if she could get away and meet me. And maybe we could grab a bite to eat. And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me. And I'm always late. But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me. 'Cause she's made that way. And if that ain't lovin' me. Then all I've got to say. God didn't make little green apples. And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes. And there's no such thing as make-believe. Puppy dogs, autumn leaves and BB guns. . God didn't make little green apples. And it don't rain in IndianapolisThe O'kaysions. Miscellaneous. Girl Watcher.

From the vinyl album "O C Smith's Greatest Hits". Oh, the path was deep and wide. From footsteps leading to our cabin. Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp. And late at night a hand would knock. And there would stand a stranger. Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp. Yeah, the weeds were high, the corn was dry. When daddy took to drinking. Him and Sally Walker, they up and ran away. Then Momma shed a silent tear. And promised fourteen children. "I swear you'll never see a hungry day". When Momma sacrificed her pride. The neighbours started talking. But we were much too young. To understand the things they said. All we really cared about. Was Momma's chicken dumplings. And a goodnight kiss. Before we went to bed. Oh, you know, the path was deep and wide. From footsteps leading to our cabin. Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp. And late at night a hand would knock. And there would stand a stranger. Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp. When Daddy left and destitution. Came upon our family. Not one neighbour volunteered. To lend a helping hand. So just let 'em gossip all they want. She loved us, and she raised us. The proof is standing here. A full grown man. Last summer Momma passed away. And left the ones who loved her. Each and every one is. More than grateful for their birth. And each Sunday she receives. A big bouquet of fourteen roses. With a card that reads. 'The Greatest Mom on Earth'. Oh, you know, the path was deep and wide. From footsteps leading to our cabin. Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp. And late at night a hand would knock. And there would stand a stranger.

A poor little baby child is born. In the ghetto. And his mama cries. 'cause if there's one thing that she don't need. It's another hungry mouth to feed. In the ghetto. People, don't you understand. The child needs a helping hand. Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day. Take a look at you and me. Are we too blind to see. Do we simply turn our heads. And look the other way. Well the world turns. And a hungry little boy with a runny nose. Plays in the street as the cold wind blows. In the ghetto. And his hunger burns. So he starts to roam the streets at night. And he learns how to steal. And he learns how to fight. In the ghetto. Then one night in desperation. The young man breaks away. He buys a gun, steals a car. Tries to run, but he don't get far. And his mama cries. As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man. Face down on the street with a gun in his hand. In the ghetto. As her young man dies. On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'. Another little baby child is born. In the ghetto. And his mama criesStanding in the dock at Southampton. Trying to get to Holland or France. The man in the mac said. "You've got to go back". You know, they didn't even give us a chance. Christ, you know it ain't easy. You know how hard it can be. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify me. Finally made the plane into Paris. Honeymooning down by the Seine. Peter Brown called to say. You can make it okay. You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain. Christ, you know it ain't easy. You know how hard it can be. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify me. So from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton. Talking in our beds for a week. The news people said. "Say, what you doing in bed?". I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace". Christ, you know it ain't easy. You know how hard it can be. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify me. Saving up your money for a rainy day. Giving all your clothes to charity. Last night the wife said. Oh boy, when you're dead. You don't take nothing with you but your soul. Think!. Made a lightning trip to Vienna. Eating chocolate cake in a bag. Newspapers said. "She's gone to his head. They look just like two gurus in drag". Christ, you know it ain't easy. You know how hard it can be. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify me. Caught the early plane back to London. Fifty acorns tied in a sack. The men from the press. Said, "We wish you success. It's good to have the both of you back". Christ, you know it ain't easy. You know how hard it can be. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify me. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify meLeft a good job in the city. Workin' for the man every night and day. And I never lost one minute of sleepin'. Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been. Big wheel keep on turnin'. Proud Mary keep on burnin'. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis. Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans. But I never saw the good side of the city. 'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen. Big wheel keep on turnin'. Proud Mary keep on burnin'. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. If you come down to the river. Bet you gonna find some people who live. You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money. People on the river are happy to give. Big wheel keep on turnin'. Proud Mary keep on burnin'. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.

Something in the way she woos me. I don't want to leave her now. You know I believe and how. Somewhere in her smile she knows. That I don't need no other lover. Something in her style that shows me. I don't want to leave her now. You know I believe and how. You're asking me, will my love grow?. I don't know, I don't know. You stick around now it may show. I don't know, I don't know.

That from her western shores. Those beautiful sailors journeyed. To the South and the North Americas with ease. In their ships with painted sails. To the East, Africa was a neighbour. Across a short strait of sea miles. The great Egyptian age is but a remnant. Of The Atlantian culture. The antediluvian kings colonised the world. All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas. In all legends, from all lands, were from far Atlantis. Knowing her fate. Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth. On board were the Twelve. The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician. And the other so-called Gods of our legends. Though Gods they were. And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind. Let us rejoice, and let us sing, and dance. And ring in the new. Hail, Atlantis!. Way down below the ocean. Where I wanna be, she may be. Way down below the ocean. Where I wanna be, she may be.

I started to cry, which started the whole world laughing. Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me. I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes. And I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that I'd said. 'Til I finally died, which started the whole world living. Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.

Oh, if I'd only seen, oh yeah, that the joke was one me, oh, no. That the joke was one me, ohI am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told. I've squandered my resistance. For a pocketful of mumbles. Such are promises. All lies and jest. Still the man hears what he wants to hear. And disregards the rest. When I left my home and my family. I was no more than a boy. In the company of strangers. In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared. Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters. Where the ragged people go. Looking for the places only they would know. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. La la la la, li. Asking only workman's wages. I come lookin' for a job but I get no offers. Just a come on from the whores on Seventh Avenue. I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome. I took some comfort there. La la la la la la la. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. La la la la, li. And I'm laying out my winter clothes. And wishing I was gone, goin' home. Where the New York City winters aren't bleedin' me. Leadin' me goin' home. In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade. And he carries the reminders. Of every glove that laid him down or cut him. 'Til he cried out in his anger and his shame. I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. La la la la, li. Li la la la, li la li. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li.

But if you love him, you'll forgive him. Even though he's hard to understand. And if you love him, oh be proud of him. 'Cause after all, he's just a man. Stand by your man. Give him two arms to cling to. And something warm to come to. When nights are cold and lonely. Stand by your man. And show the world you love him. Keep giving all the love you can. Stand by your man. Stand by your man. And show the world you love him. Keep giving all the love you can. Stand by your manThe road is long. With many a winding turn. That leads us to who knows where. Who knows where. But I'm strong. Strong enough to carry him. He ain't heavy, he's my brother. So on we go. His welfare is of my concern. No burden is he to bear. We'll get there. For I know. He would not encumber me. He ain't heavy, he's my brother. If I'm laden at all. I'm laden with sadness. That everyone's heart. Isn't filled with the gladness. Of love for one another. It's a long, long road. From which there is no return. While we're on the way to there. Why not share. And the load. Doesn't weigh me down at all. He ain't heavy he's my brother. He's my brother. He ain't heavy, he's my brother. He ain't heavy, he's my brotherIt's the time of the season. When love runs high. In this time, give it to me easy. And let me try. With pleasured hands.

I chose you for the one. Now we're having so much fun. You treated me so kind. I'm about to lose my mind. You made me so very happy. I'm so glad you came into my life. The others were untrue. But when it came to loving you. I'd spend my whole life with you. 'Cause you came and you took control. You touched my very soul. You always showed me that. Loving you is where it's at. You made me so very happy. I'm so glad you came into my life. Thank you baby, yeah, yeah. I love you so much you see. You're even in my dreams, I can hear you. Baby, I can hear you callin' me. I'm so in love with you. All I ever want to do is. Thank you baby, thank you baby. You made me so very happy. I'm so glad you came into my life. You made me so very happy. You made me so, so very happy baby. I'm so glad you came into my life. I want to thank you, girl. Every day of my life, I want to thank you. You made me so very happy. That I wanna spend my life thanking you. Thank you baby, thank you baby. Thank you baby, thank you babyWell, my daddy left home when I was three. And he didn't leave much to ma and me. Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze. Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid. But the meanest thing that he ever did. Was before he left, he went and named me Sue. Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke. And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk. It seems I had to fight my whole life through. Some gal would giggle and I'd get red. And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head. I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue. Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean. My fist got hard and my wits got keen. I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame. But I made me a vow to the moon and stars. That I'd search the honky tonks and bars. And kill that man who gave me that awful name. Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid July. And I just hit town and my throat was dry. I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew. At an old saloon on a street of mud. There at a table, dealing stud. Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue. Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad. From a worn out picture that my mother had. And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye. He was big and bent and gray and old. And I looked at him and my blood ran cold. And I said, "My name is Sue! How do you do?. Now you're gonna die". Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes. And he went down, but to my surprise. He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair right across his teeth. And we crashed through the wall and into the street. Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer. I tell ya, I've fought tougher men. But I really can't remember when. He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile. I heard him laugh and then I heard him curse. He went for his gun and I pulled mine first. He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile. And he said, "Son, this world is rough. And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough. And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along. So I give you that name and I said goodbye. I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's the name that helped to make you strong". He said, "Now you just fought one hell of a fight. And I know you hate me, and you got the right. To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do. But you ought to thank me, before I die. For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye. 'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue. What could I do? Yeah what could I do?. I got all choked up and I threw down my gun. And I called him my pa, and he called me his son. And I came away with a different point of view. And I think about him, now and then. Every time I try and every time I win. And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him. Bill or George anything but Sue I still hate that nameAll my bags are packed, I'm ready to go. I'm standing here outside your door. I hate to wake you up to say goodbye. But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn. Taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn. Already I'm so lonesome I could cry. So kiss me and smile for me. Tell me that you'll wait for me. Hold me like you'll never let me go. I'm leavin' on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Oh babe, I hate to go. There's so many times I've let you down. So many times I've played around. I tell you now, they don't mean a thing. Every place I go, I think of you. Every song I sing, I sing for you. When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring. So kiss me and smile for me. Tell me that you'll wait for me. Hold me like you'll never let me go. I'm leavin' on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Oh babe, I hate to go. Now the time has come to leave you. One more time let me kiss you. Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way. Dream about the days to come. When I won't have to leave alone. About the time, I won't have to say. Kiss me and smile for me. Tell me that you'll wait for me. Hold me like you'll never let me go. I'm leavin' on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Leavin' on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Leavin' on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Oh babe, I hate to goYou talk like Marlène Dietrich. And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire. Your clothes are all made by Balmain. And there's diamonds and pearls in your hair, yes there are. You live in a fancy apartment. Off the Boulevard Saint-Michel. Where you keep your Rolling Stones records. And a friend of Sacha Distel, yes you do. But where do you go to my lovely. When you're alone in your bed. Tell me the thoughts that surround you. I want to look inside your head, yes I do. I've seen all your qualifications. You got from the Sorbonne. And the painting you stole from Picasso. Your loveliness goes on and on, yes it does. When you go on your summer vacation you go to Juan-les-Pins. With your carefully designed topless swimsuit. You get an even sun tan, on your back and on your legs. When the snow falls you're found in Saint Moritz. With the others of the jet-set. And you sip your Napoleon brandy. But you never get your lips wet, no you don't. But where do you go to my lovely. When you're alone in your bed. Won't you tell me the thoughts that surround you. I want to look inside your head, yes I do. Your name, it is heard in high places. You know the Aga Khan. He sent you a racehorse for Christmas. And you keep it just for fun, for a laugh ahaha. They say that when you get married. It'll be to a millionaire. But they don't realise where you came from. And I wonder if they really care or give a damn. Where do you go to my lovely. When you're alone in your bed. Tell me the thoughts that surround you. I want to look inside your head, yes I do. I remember the back streets of Naples. Two children begging in rags. Both touched with a burning ambition. To shake off their lowly born tags, and they try. So look into my face, Marie-Claire. And remember just who you are. Then go and forget me forever. But I know you still bear the scar deep inside, yes you do. I know where you go to my lovely. When you're alone in your bed. I know the thoughts that surround you. Cause I can look inside your headPlease don't make me wait too late tomorrow comes. And I will not be late. Late to day when it becomes tomorrow I will. Leave to go a-way. Goodbye... Goodbye.... Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye. Songs that lingered on my lips excite me now. And linger on my mind. Leave your flowers at my door I'll leave them for. The one who waits behind. Goodbye... Goodbye.... Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye. Far away my lover sings a lonely song. And calls me to her side. When a song of lonely love invites me on. I must go to her side. Goodbye... Goodbye.... Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, GoodbyeAnd now the end is near. And so I face the final curtain. My friend, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case of which I'm certain. I've lived a life that's full. I've travelled each and every highway. and more, much more than this. I did it my way. Regrets I've had a few. But then again too few to mention. I did what I had to do. And saw it through without exemption. I planned each chartered course. Each careful step along the by-way. And more, much more than this. I did it my way. Yes, there were times. I'm sure you knew. When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all when there was doubt. I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all. And I stood tall. And did it my way. I've loved, I've laughed, and cried. I've had my fill, my share of losing. And now, as tears subside. I find it all so amusing. To think I did all that. And may I say, not in a shy way. "Oh no, oh no, not me. I did it my way". For what is a man, what has he got?. If not himself then he has naught. To say the things he truly feels. And not the words of one who kneels. The record shows I took the blows. And did it my way. Yes, it was my waySome folks are born made to wave the flag. ooo, they're red, white and blue. And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief". ooo, they point the cannon at you, Lord. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no senator's son, no. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no fortunate one, no. Some folks are born silver spoon in hand. Lord, don't they help themselves, yeah. But when the taxman comes to the door. Lord, the house look a like a rummage sale, yeah. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no millionaire's son, no, no. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no fortunate one, no. (Guitar). Yeah, some folks inherit star-spangled eyes. ooo, they send you down to war, Lord. And when you ask 'em how much should we give. ooo, they only answer; more, more, more yeah. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no military son, son, no no. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no fortunate one, one. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no fortunate one, no, no, no. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no fortunate son, no, no, noHold it, everybody. Hold it, hold it, listen. I can turn the gray sky blue. I can make it rain whenever I want it to. Oh, I can build a castle from a single grain of sand. I can make a ship sail, huh, on dry land. But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue. 'Cause I can't get next to you. Next to you. I just can't get next you. I can fly like a bird in the sky. Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy. Oh, I can turn a river into a raging fire. I can live forever if I so desire.

La-da da da da da de. Talking 'bout you and me. And the games people play. Oh we make one another cry. Break a heart then we say goodbye. Cross our hearts and we hope to die. That the other was to blame. Neither one ever will give in. So we gaze at our eight by ten. Thinking 'bout the things that might have been. It's a dirty rotten shame. Repeat Chorus. People walking up to you. Singing glory hallelulia. And they're tryin to sock it to you. In the name of the Lord. They're gonna teach you how to meditate. Read your horoscope, cheat your faith. And further more to hell with hate. Come on and get on board. Repeat Chorus. Look around tell me what you see. What's happening to you and me. God grant me the serenity. To remember who I am. Cause you've given up your sanity. For your pride and your vanity. Turned your back on humanity. And you don't give a da da da da da. Repeat ChorusSir Douglas Quintet is back. We'd like to thank all our beautiful friends all over the country. And all the beautiful vibrations. We love you. Teeny bopper, My teenage lover. I caught your waves last night. It set my mind a wond' rin'. You're such a groove, please don't move. Please stay in my love house by the river. Fast talkin' guys with strange red eyes. Have put things in your head. It set my mind a wond' rin'. I love you so, please don't go. Please stay here with me in Mendocino. Mendocino, Mendocino. Where life's such a groove. You blow your mind in the morning. We used to walk through the park. Make love along the way in Mendocino. Like I told you. Can you, dig it?. If you want to groove I'll be glad to have you. I Love you so. Please don't go. Please stay here with me in Mendocino{melody}. . Love is but a song we sing, fear's the way we die.. You can make the mountains ring or make the angels cry.. Though the bird is on the wing and you may not know why…. . Come on people now, smile on your brother,. Everybody get together…try to love one another right now.. . Some may come and some may go, we will surely pass. When the one that left us here returns for us at last.. We are but a moment's sunlight fading in the grass.. . Come on people now, smile on your brother. Everybody get together …try to love one another right now.. . Come on people now Smile on your brother. Everybody get together…try to love one another right now.. . {solo verse}. . Come on people now, smile on your brother,. Everybody get together…try to love one another right now.. . {melody}. . If you hear the song I sing you will understand.. You hold the key to love and fear…all in your tremblin’ hand.. Just one key unlocks them both, it's there at your command.. . Come on people now, smile on your brother,. Everybody get together…try to love one another right now.. . Come on people now, smile on your brother,. Everybody get together…try to love one another right now.. . Come on people now, smile on your brother,. Everybody get together…try to love one another. Right now…right now…right now….Jean.

All the leaves have gone green. And the clouds are so low. You can touch them, and so. Come out to the meadow, Jean. Jean, Jean, you're young and alive. Come out of your half-dreamed dream. And run, if you will, to the top of the hill. Open your arms, bonnie Jean. Till the sheep in the valley come home my way. Till the stars fall around me and find me alone. When the sun comes a-singin' I'll still be waitin'. For Jean, Jean, roses are red. And all of the leaves have gone green. While the hills are ablaze with the moon's yellow haze. Come into my arms, bonnie Jean. (Jean, Jean). Jean, you're young and alive!. Come out of your half-dreamed dream. And run, if you will to the top of the hill. Come into my arms, bonnie Jean. Jean.

Don't ask me why but time has passed us by. Someone else moved in from far away. Now we are tall and Christmas trees are small. And you don't ask the time of day. But you and I, our love will never die. But guess we'll cry come first of May. The apple tree that grew for you and me. I watched the apples falling one by one. And I recall the moment of them all.

Someone else moved in from far awayEver since I was a young boy. I've played the silver ball. From Soho down to Brighton. I must have played them all. But I ain't seen nothing like him. In any amusement hall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. He stands like a statue. Becomes part of the machine. Feeling all the bumpers. Always playing clean. Plays by intuition. The digit counters fall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. He's a pinball wizard. There has to be a twist. A pinball wizard's. Got such a supple wrist. How do you think he does it? I don't know. What makes him so good?. Ain't got no distractions. Can't hear no buzzers and bells. Don't see no lights a flashing. Plays by sense of smell. Always gets a replay. Never see him fall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. I thought I was the bally table king. But I just handed my pinball crown to him. Even on my favorite table. He can beat my best. His disciples lead him in. And he just does the rest. He's got crazy flipper fingers. Never seen him fall. That deaf, dumb and blind kind. Sure plays a mean pinballIt's your thing. Do what you wanna do. I can't tell you. Who to sock it to. It's your thing. Do what you wanna do now. I can't tell you. Who to sock it to.
