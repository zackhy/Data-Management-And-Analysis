From ten thousand lightning bugs. As they tried to teach me how to dance. A foxtrot above my head. A sock hop beneath my bed. A disco ball is just hanging by a thread.

I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air. See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns. See you make your way through the crowd. And say "Hello", little did I know.... That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles. And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet". And I was crying on the staircase. Begging you "Please don't go", & I said.... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run. You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". So I sneak out to the garden to see you. We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew. So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while. 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter. And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet". But you were everything to me. I was begging you "Please don't go", & I said.... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run. You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel. This love is difficult but it's real. Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". .... I got tired of waiting. Wondering if you were ever coming around. My faith in you was fading. When I met you on the outskirts of town. And I said.... Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone. I keep waiting for you but you never come. Is this in my head? I don't know what to think. He knelt to the ground & pulled out a ring & said. Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone. I love you & that's all I really know. I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". Oh oh oh. 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you1, 2, 3. Not only you and me. Got one eighty degrees.

Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent. The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student. To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar. And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later. Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys that just want to enjoy. But having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy. There's a she wolf in the closet. Open up and set her free. There's a she wolf in your closet. Let it out so it can breathe. S.O.S. she's in disguise. S.O.S. she's in disguise. There's a she wolf in disguise. Coming out, coming out, coming out. S.O.S. she's in disguise. S.O.S. she's in disguise. There's a she wolf in disguise. Coming out, coming out, coming out. There's a she wolf in your closet. Let it out so it can breatheYou're on the phone with your girlfriend—she's upset. She's going off about something that you said. 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.. I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.. I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.. And she'll never know your story like I do. But she wears short skirts. I wear t-shirt¶. She's cheer captain¶. And I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find. That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.. If you could see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So, why can't you see. You belong with me. You belong with me?. Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans. I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.. Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself. "Hey, isn't this easy?". And you've got a smile. That can light up this whole town. I haven't seen it in awhile. Since she brought you down.. You say you're fine—I know you better than that. Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?. She wears high heels. I wear sneakers. She's cheer captain¶. And I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find. That what you're looking for has been here the whole time. If you could see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So, why can't you see. You belong with me?. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.. All this time how could you not know, baby?. You belong with me. You belong with me. Oh, I remember you driving to my house. In the middle of the night. I'm the one who makes you laugh. When you know you're 'bout to cry. I know your favorite songs. And you tell me about your dreams. Think I know where you belong. Think I know it's with me. Can't you se that I'm the one. Who understands you?. Been here all along. So, why can't you see. You belong with me?. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.. All this time how could you not know, baby?. You belong with me. You belong with me. You belong with me. Have you ever thought just maybe. You belong with me?. You belong with meI can almost see it. That dream I'm dreaming, but. There's a voice inside my head saying. You'll never reach it. Every step I'm taking. Every move I make feels. Lost with no direction. My faith is shaking. But I, I gotta keep trying. Gotta keep my head held high. There's always gonna be another mountain. I'm always gonna wanna make it move. Always gonna be an uphill battle. Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose. Ain't about how fast I get there. Ain't about what's waiting on the other side. It's the climb. The struggles I'm facing. The chances I'm taking. Sometimes might knock me down, but. No, I'm not breaking. I may not know it. But these are the moments that. I'm gonna remember most, yeah. Just gotta keep going. And I, I gotta be strong. Just keep pushing on, 'cause. There's always gonna be another mountain. I'm always gonna wanna make it move. Always gonna be an uphill battle. Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose. Ain't about how fast I get there. Ain't about what's waiting on the other side. It's the climb. Yeah. There's always gonna be another mountain. I'm always gonna wanna make it move. Always gonna be an uphill battle. Sometimes you're gonna have to lose. Ain't about how fast I get there. Ain't about what's waiting on the other side. It's the climb. Yeah, yeah. Keep on moving, keep climbing. Keep the faith, baby. It's all about, it's all about the climb. Keep your faith, keep your faith. WhoaIn the night, I hear 'em talk,. The coldest story ever told.

What a day, one day and your Jesus really died for me. I guess Jesus really tried for me. Bodies in the Bodhi Tree, bodies making chemistry. Bodies on my family, bodies in the way of me.

And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve. So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean. Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes. Give me reason to fill this hole, connect the space between. Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divide. There was nothing in sight but memories left abandoned. There was nowhere to hide, the ashes fell like snow. And the ground caved in between where we were standing. And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve. So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean. Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes across this new divide. In every loss, in every lie, in every truth that you'd deny. And each regret and each goodbye was a mistake too great to hide. And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve. So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean. Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes. Give me reason to fill this hole, connect the space between. Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divide.

Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind. And try to take the path less traveled by. That first step you take is the longest stride. If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late. Could you say goodbye to yesterday?. Would you live each moment like your last. Leave old pictures in the past?. Donate every dime you had, if today was your last day?. What if, what if, if today was your last day?. Against the grain should be a way of life. What's worth the price is always worth the fight. Every second counts 'cause there's no second try. So live like you're never living twice. Don't take the free ride in your own life. If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late. Could you say goodbye to yesterday?. Would you live each moment like your last?. Leave old pictures in the past?. Donate every dime you had?. And would you call those friends you never see?. Reminisce old memories?. Would you forgive your enemies?. And would you find that one you're dreaming of?. Swear up and down to God above. That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?. If today was your last day. Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?. You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars. Regardless of who you are. So do whatever it takes. 'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life. Let nothing stand in your way. 'Cause the hands of time are never on your side. If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late. Could you say goodbye to yesterday?. Would you live each moment like your last?. Leave old pictures in the past?. Donate every dime you had?. And would you call those friends you never see?. Reminisce old memories?. Would you forgive your enemies?. And would you find that one you're dreaming of. Swear up and down to God above. That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?Jason Mraz. We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things. Lucky. Do you hear me,. I'm talking to you. Across the water across the deep blue ocean.

Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin?. Like a house of cards. One blow from caving in. Do you ever feel already buried deep?. Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing. Do you know that there's still a chance for you?. 'Cause there's a spark in you. You just gotta ignite the light. And let it shine. Just own the night. Like the Fourth of July.

After a hurricane comes a rainbow. Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed. So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road. Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow. And when it's time, you'll know. You just gotta ignite the light. And let it shine. Just own the night. Like the Fourth of July. 'Cause, baby, you're a firework. Come on, show 'em what you're worth.

Cause after all the partying and smashing and crashing. And all the glitz and glam and the fashion. And all the pandemonium and all the madness. There comes a time when you fade to the blackness. And when you're staring at the phone in your lap. And you hoping but them people never call you back. But that's just how the story unfolds. You get another hand soon after you fold.

I'll get you there. You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em. But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em. Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem. When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn. What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world. Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me. I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly. And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony. No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he. From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n. Whether he's on salary, paid hourly. Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him. Whichever comes first, for better or worse. He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas. His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge. To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe. I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let you know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road. Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap. I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap. You said you was king, you lied through your teeth. For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped. And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back. I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact. Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehhhh". Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground. Relax, I ain't going back to that now. All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW. Cause I ain't playin' around. There's a game called circle and I don't know how. I'm way too up to back down. But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out. Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't. This fucking black cloud still follow's me around. But it's time to exorcise these demons. These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!. I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let you know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road. And I just can't keep living this way. So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage. I'm standing up, Imma face my demons. I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground. I've had enough, now I'm so fed up. Time to put my life back together right now. It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me. Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you. So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through. And don't even realise what you did, believe me you. I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger. I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of. My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead. No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise. To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father. So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it. You couldn't lift a single shingle on it. Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club. Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up. Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon. But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and. I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let you know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel that you've been down the same roadYou're a good soldier. Choosing your battles. Pick yourself up and dust yourself off. And back in the saddle. You're on the frontline. Everyone's watching. You know it's serious, we're getting closer. This isn't over. The pressure is on. You feel it. But you've got it all. Believe it. When you fall, get up, oh oh. And if you fall get up, eh eh. Tsamina mina zangalewa. 'Cause this is Africa. Tsamina mina eh eh.

For, moreover, I miss her, when will I learn?. Didn't give her all my love, guess now I got my payback. Now I'm in the club, thinkin' all about my baby. Hey, she was so easy to love. But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough. I'm goin' through it every time that I'm alone. And now I miss her and wishin' she'd pick up the phone. But she made the decision that she wanted to move on. 'Cause I was wrong. I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me. Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gonna be. Opened my eyes, yeah. It was only just a dream. So I traveled back down that road. Wish she'd come back, no one knows. I realized, yeah. It was only just a dream. If you ever loved somebody, put your hands up.

Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts. I say, can you believe it?. As we're lying on the couch. The moment I can see it. Yes, yes. I can see it now. Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?. You put your arm around me for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine. Flash forward & we're taking on the world together. And there's a drawer of my things at your place. You learn my secrets & you figure out why I'm guarded. You say we'll never make my parent's mistakes. But we got bills to pay. We got nothing figured out. When it was hard to take. Yes, yes. This is what I thought about. Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?. You put your arm around me for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine. Do you remember all the city lights on the water?. You saw me start to believe for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine. And I remember that fight, 2: 30 AM. As everything was slipping right out of our hands. I ran out crying & you followed me out into the street. Braced myself for the goodbye. 'Cause that's all I've ever known. Then you took me by surprise. You said I'll never leave you alone. You said. I remember how we felt sitting by the water. And every time I look at you, it's like the first time. I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter. She is the best thing that's ever been mine. Hold on, make it last. Hold on, never turn back. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine. Do you believe it?. We're gonna make it now. And I can see it. I can see it nowBarbra Streisand. Barbra Streisand. Barbra Streisand. Barbra Streisand. Barbra Streisand. Barbra Streisand. Barbra Streisand. Barbra Streisand.

I could do what I want, and I'm doing alright. That's why I just might celebrate tonight. And if you ain't down with it, then get on your bike. To sank elsewhere, who the hell cares. I'm in great shape, you need health care. If you can't say something nice, then keep quiet. Or come to the club, there's girls there. I'm goin' to rave 'til six in the mornin'. I can already hear the baseline callin'. Just make up your mind, stop stallin'. And don't be half assed, 'cause I'm all in. So if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it.

I haven't seen them in a while. You've been good, busier then ever. We small talk, work and the weather. Your guard is up and I know why. 'Cause the last time you saw me. Is still burned in the back of your mind. You gave me roses and I left them there to die. So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night. And I'd go back to December all the time. It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right. I'd go back to December all the time. These days I haven't been sleeping. Staying up playing back myself leaving. When your birthday passed and I didn't call. And I think about summer, all the beautiful times. I watched you laughing from the passenger side and. Realized I loved you in the fall. And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind. You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye. So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night. And I'd go back to December all the time. It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind. I'd go back to December all the time. I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right. And how you held me in your arms that September night. The first time you ever saw me cry. Maybe this is wishful thinking. Probably mindless dreaming. If we loved again I swear I'd love you right. I'd go back in time and change it but I can't. So if the chain is on your door, I understand. But this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night. And I'd go back to December. It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright. I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind. I'd go back to December all the time. All the timeKonvict music (oh yeah). (Yeah). This life don't last forever (Hold my hand).

That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?. I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back. But I just can't remember it all. What am I doing?. What am I doing?. Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me. I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over. 'Til it's over. But it's far from over. Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it. Never drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?. Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'. 'Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett. I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?. You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone. I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone. I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known. Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas. All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers. Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's. I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker. Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either. Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer. It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds. When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it. I know way too many people here right now. That I didn't know last year. Who the fuck are y'all?. I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back. But I just can't remember it all. What am I doing?. What am I doing?. Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me. I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over. 'Til it's over. But it's far from over. One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain. And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane. So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game. It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'. I really can't complain, everything is kosher. Two thumbs up. Ebert and Roper. I really can't see the end getting any closer. But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over. So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on. Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on. Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on. If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on. Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?. I'm really too young to be feeling this old. It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?. And nobody's ever done it like I did it. I know way too many people here right now. That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?. I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back. But I just can't remember it all. What am I doing?. What am I doing?. Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me. I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over. 'Til it's over. But it's far from over. Yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me. I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over. 'Til it's over. But it's far from overSomebody said you got a new friend. Does he love you better than I can?. There's a big black sky over my town. I know where you're at, I bet he's around. And yeah, I know it's stupid. But I just gotta see it for myself. I'm in the corner, watching you kiss him. Ohh. I'm right over here, why can't you see me. Ohh. And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home. I keep dancing on my own. I'm just wanna dance all night. I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line. Stilettos and broken bottles. I'm spinning around in circles. And I'm in the corner, watching you kiss him. Ohh. And I'm right over here, why can't you see me. Ohh. And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home. I keep dancing on my own. So far away but still so near. The lights come up, the music dies. But you don't see me standing here. I just came to say goodbye. I'm in the corner, watching you kiss him. Ohh. And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home. And I keep dancing on my own. Said I'm in the corner, watching you kiss him. Ohh no. And I'm right over here, why can't you see me. Ohh no. And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home. And I keep dancing on my own. So far away, but still so near. The lights come up, the music dies. But you don't see me standing hereYeah, yeah. This is not the end. This is not the beginning. Just a voice like a riot. Rocking every revision. But you listen to the tone. And the violet rhythm. And though the words sound steady. Something empty's within 'em. We say, yeah. With fists flying up in the air. Like we're holding onto something. That's invisible there. 'Cause we're living at the mercy. Of the pain and the fear. Until we dead it, forget it. Let it all disappear, yeah. Waiting for the end to come. Wishing I had strength to stand. This is not what I had planned. It's out of my control. Flying at the speed of light. Thoughts were spinning in my head. So many things were left unsaid. It's hard to let you go. I know what it takes to move on. I know how it feels to lie. All I wanna do is trade. This life for something new. Holding on to what I haven't got. Sitting in an empty room. Trying to forget the past. This was never meant to last. I wish it wasn't so. I know what it takes to move on. I know how it feels to lie. All I wanna do is trade. This life for something new. Holding on to what I haven't got. Yeah, yeah. What was left when that fire was gone?. I thought it felt right but that right was wrong. All caught up in the eye of the storm. And trying to figure out what it's like moving on. And I don't even know what kind of things I've said. My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead. So picking up the pieces, now where to begin. The hardest part of ending is starting again. All I wanna do is trade. This life for something new. Holding on to what I haven't got. This is not the end. This is not the beginning. Just a voice like a riot. Rocking every revision. But you listen to the tone. And the violet rhythm. Though the words sound steady. Something empty's within 'em. We say, yeah. With fists flying up in the air. Like we're holding onto something. That's invisible there. 'Cause we're living at the mercy. Of the pain and the fear. Until we dead it, forget it. Let it all disappearYellow diamonds in the light. And we're standing side by side. As your shadow crosses mine. What it takes to come alive. It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny. But I've gotta let it go. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. Shine a light through an open door. Love and life I will divide. Turn away cause I need you more. Feel the heartbeat in my mind. It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny. But I've gotta let it go. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. We found love in a hopeless place. Yellow diamonds in the light.

Let's go, yeah, you're listening now. They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while. That's why they play my song on so many different dials. 'Cause I got more fucking hits than a disciplined child. So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps. Man I'm like a young gun fully black Barrack. I cried tear drops over the massive attack. I only make hits like I work with the racket and bat. Look at my jacket and hat. So damn berserk, so down to earth, I'm bringing gravity back. Adopted by the major, I want my family back. People work hard just to get all their salary taxed. Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malory Blackman. Where the hell's all the sanity at? Damn.

But have you ever been so hungry it keeps you awake?. Mate, now my hunger would leave 'em amazed, great. It feels like a long time coming, fam. Since the day I thought of that cunning plan.

And as it fell, you rose to claim it. It was dark and I was over. Until you kissed my lips and you saved me. My hands, they were strong, but my knees were far too weak. To stand in your arms without falling to your feet. But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew. All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true. And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win. But I set fire to the rain. Watched it pour as I touched your face. Well, it burned while I cried. 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name. When laying with you I could stay there. Close my eyes, feel you here forever. You and me together, nothing is better. 'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew. All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true. And the games you's play, you would always win, always win. But I set fire to the rain. Watched it pour as I touched your face. Well, it burned while I cried. 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name. I set fire to the rain. And I threw us into the flames. When we fell, something died. 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time. Sometimes I wake up by the door. That heart you caught must be waiting for you. Even now when we're already over. I can't help myself from looking for you. I set fire to the rain. Watched it pour as I touch your face. Well, it burned while I cried. 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name. I set fire to the rain. And I threw us into the flames. When we fell, something died. 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh. Oh, no. Let it burn, oh. Let it burn. Let it burnI'm coming home, I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away. All the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits. And they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home, I'm coming home. Tell the world that I'm coming. I'm back where I belong. Yeah I never felt so strong. I'm feelin' like there's nothing that I can't try.   (I'm back, baby). And if you with me put your hands high.   (Put your hands high). If you ever lost a life before, this one's for you.   (And if you with me put your hands high). And you, and you and you and you.   (Your dreams are filled, you're rapping with the best). I hear "The Tears Of A Clown", I hate that song. I feel like they talking to me when it comes on. Another day another dawn. Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone. What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on. It's easy to be Puff, but it's harder to be Sean. What if the twins ask why I ain't marry they mom?.   (Why? Damn). How do I respond?. What if my son stares with a face like my own. And says he wants to be like me when he's grown. Damn, but I ain't finished growin'. Another night the inevitable prolongs. Another day, another dawn. Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'. Another lie that I carry on. I need to get back to the place I belong. I'm coming home, I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away. All the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits. And they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home, I'm coming home. Tell the world that I'm coming. "A house Is Not A Home", I hate this song. Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?. And people got the nerve to blame you for it. And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it. But you felt it and still feel it. And money can't make up for it or conceal it. But you deal with it and you keep ballin'. Pour out some liquor, play boy, and we keep ballin'. Baby, we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love. But we've been living as friends. So you've been a guest in your own home. It's time to make your house your own, pick up your phone, come on. I'm coming home, I'm coming home. Tell the world I'm coming home. Let the rain wash away. All the pain of yesterday. I know my kingdom awaits. And they've forgiven my mistakes. I'm coming home, I'm coming home. Tell the world that I'm coming. "Ain't No Stopping Us Now", I love that song. Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong. I thought I told y'all that we won't stop. 'Til back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks. It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy. Drove me away than embraced me, forgave me. For all of my shortcomings, welcome to my homecoming. Yeah it's been a long time coming. Lot of fights, lot of scars. Lot of bottles, lot of cars. Lot of ups, lot of downs. Made it back, lost my dog. (I miss you Big). And here I stand, a better man. (A better man). Thank you Lord. (Thank you Lord). I'm coming home, I'm coming home.

This melody was meant for you, so sing-a-long to my stereo. If I was just another dusty record on the shelf. Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else. If I asked you to scratch my back could you handle that. Like yikky-yea tricky Travie, I can handle that. Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks. It's just the last girl that played me left a couple tracks. I used to, used to, used to now I'm over that. 'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts. If I could only find the note to make you understand. I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand. Keep it stuck inside your head like your favorite tune. And know my hearts a stereo that only plays for you. My hearts a stereo, it beats for you so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh. Make me your radio, turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you, so sing-a-long to my stereo. If I was an old school 50-pound boom box. Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk. Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops. And crank it higher every time they told you to stop. And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me. When you have to purchase mad D Batteries. Appreciate every mix tape your friends made. You never know we come and go like on the interstate. I think I finally found the note to make you understand. If you can hear then sing a long and take you by the hand. Just keep it stuck inside your head like your favorite tune. You know my hearts a stereo that only plays for you. My hearts a stereo, it beats for you so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh. Make me your radio, turn me up when you feel low. This melody was meant for you, so sing-a-long to my stereo. I only pray you'll never leave me behind. Because good music can be so hard to find. I'll take your head and hold it closer to mine. Thought love was dead but now you're changing my mind. My hearts a stereo, it beats for you so listen close. Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh. Make me your radio, turn me up when you feel low.

I'm in his favorite sun dress. Watching me get undressed. Take that body downtown. I say you the bestest. Lean in for a big kiss. Put his favorite perfume on. Go play a video game. It's you, it's you, it's all for you. Everything I do. I tell you all the time. Heaven is a place on earth with you. Tell me all the things you want to do. I heard that you like the bad girls. Honey, is that true?. It's better than I ever even knew. They say that the world was built for two. Only worth living if somebody is loving you. Baby now you do. Singing in the old bars. Swinging with the old stars. Living for the fame. Kissing in the blue dark. Playing pool and wild darts. Video games. He holds me in his big arms. Drunk and I am seeing stars. This is all I think of. Watching all our friends fall. In and out of Old Paul's. This is my idea of fun. Playing video games. It's you, it's you, it's all for you. Everything I do. I tell you all the time.

'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication. To realize what we used to have,. We don't have it anymore.. There's no religion that could save me. No matter how long my knees are on the floor. So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making. To keep you by my side. To keep you from walkin' out the door.. 'Cause there'll be no sunlight. If I lose you, baby. There'll be no clear skies. If I lose you, baby. Just like the clouds. My eyes will do the same, if you walk away. Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain. I'll never be your mother's favorite. Your daddy can't even look me in the eye. Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing. Sayin' "There goes my little girl. Walkin' with that troublesome guy". But they're just afraid of something they can't understand. Ooh, but little darlin' watch me change their minds. Yeah for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try. And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding. If that'll make you mine. 'Cause there'll be no sunlight. If I lose you, baby. There'll be no clear skies. If I lose you, baby. Just like the clouds. My eyes will do the same, if you walk away. Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain. Oh, don't you say (don't you say) goodbye (goodbye),. Don't you say (don't you say) goodbye (goodbye). I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding. If that'll make it right. 'Cause there'll be no sunlight. If I lose you, baby. There'll be no clear skies. If I lose you, baby. And just like the clouds. My eyes will do the same, if you walk away. Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ainI know I can't take one more step towards you. 'Cause all that's waiting is regret. Don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore. You lost the love I loved the most. I learned to live half alive. And now you want me one more time. And who do you think you are?. Runnin' 'round leaving scars. Collecting your jar of hearts. And tearing love apart. You're gonna catch a cold. From the ice inside your soul. So don't come back for me. Who do you think you are?. I hear you're asking all around. If I am anywhere to be found. But I have grown too strong. To ever fall back in your arms. And I've learned to live half alive. And now you want me one more time. And who do you think you are?. Runnin' 'round leaving scars. Collecting your jar of hearts. And tearing love apart. You're gonna catch a cold. From the ice inside your soul. So don't come back for me. Who do you think you are?. And it took so long just to feel alright. Remember how to put back the light in my eyes. I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed. 'Cause you broke all your promises. And now you're back. You don't get to get me back. And who do you think you are?. Runnin' 'round leaving scars. Collecting your jar of hearts. And tearing love apart. You're gonna catch a cold. From the ice inside your soul. So don't come back for me. Don't come back at all. And who do you think you are?. Runnin' 'round leaving scars. Collecting your jar of hearts. Tearing love apart. You're gonna catch a cold. From the ice inside your soul. Don't come back for me. Don't come back at all. Who do you think you are?. Who do you think you are?. Who do you think you are?Made a wrong turn, once or twice. Dug my way out, blood and fire. Bad decisions, that's alright. Welcome to my silly life. Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood. Miss, no way it's all good, it didn't slow me down. Mistaken, always second guessing. Underestimated, look, I'm still around. Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel. Like you're less than perfect. Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel. Like you're nothing, you're perfect to me. You're so mean when you talk. About yourself, you are wrong. Change the voices in your head. Make them like you instead. So complicated, look how big you'll make it. Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game. It's enough, I've done all I can think of. Chased down all my demons, see you do the same. Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel. Like you're less than perfect. Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel. Like you're nothing, you're perfect to me. The whole world stares while I swallow the fear. The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer. So cool in lying and we tried, tried, tried. But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time. Done looking for the critics 'cause they're everywhere. They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair. Strange ourselves and we do it all the time.

Waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?. Or was it 'cause some bitches wrote him off?. Little hussy ass fusses. Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?. What difference it make?. What's it take to get it through your thick skulls. That this ain't some bullshit. People don't usually come back this way. From a place that was dark. As I was in just to get to this place. Now these words be like. A switchblade to a hater's ribcage. And let be known from this day forward. I wanna just say thanks. 'Cause your hate is what gave me the strength. So let them Bic's raise 'cause I came with 5'9". But I feel like I'm 6'8". This one's for you and me. Livin' out our dreams. We're all right where we should be. With my arms out wide. I open my eyes. And now all I wanna see. Is a sky full of lighters. A sky full of lighters. By the time you hear this I probably already be outty. I advance like goin' from totin' iron. To goin' and buyin' four or five of the homies. To Iron Man Audi. My daddy told me, slow down boy, you're gonna blow it. And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute. To tell Shady I love him the same way. That he did Dr. Dre on the Chronic. Tell him how real he is or how high I am. Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it. I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back. So it's only right, that I write till he can march right. In to that post office and tell 'em to hang it up. Now his career's Lebron's jersey in twenty years. I stop when I'm at the very top. You shitted on me on your way up. There's 'bout to be a scary drop. 'Cause what goes up, must come down. You goin' down on something. You don't wanna see, like a hairy box. Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now. Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy. Now I'm just the cat's meow, ow, I'm classic now. Always down for the catch weight, like Pacquiao. Y'all are doomed, I remember. When T-Pain ain't wanna work with me. My car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes. 'Cause now I'm in the Aston. I went from havin' my city locked up. To gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick. And now I'm fantastic, compared to a weed high. And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches. On a radio and TV, see me, we fly. Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams. Starin' at a bee hive and how real is that?. I remember signin' my first deal. Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that. Now Bruno can show his ass. Without the MTV awards gag. You and I know what it's like. To be kicked down, forced to fight. But tonight we're alright. So hold up your light, let it shine. 'Cause this one's for you and me. Livin' out our dreams. We're all right where we should be. Lift my arms out wide. I open my eyes. And now all I wanna see. Is a sky full of lighters. A sky full of lightersOh, sometimes. I get a good feeling, yeah.

You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see. But I have seen the same. I know the shame in your defeat. But I will hold on hope. And I won't let you choke. On the noose around your neck. And I'll find strength in pain. And I will change my ways. I'll know my name as it's called again. Cause I have other things to fill my time. You take what is yours and I'll take mine. Now let me at the truth. Which will refresh my broken mind. So tie me to a post and block my ears. I can see widows and orphans through my tears. I know my call despite my faults. And despite my growing fears. But I will hold on hope. And I won't let you choke. On the noose around your neck. And I'll find strength in pain. And I will change my ways. I'll know my name as it's called again. So come out of your cave walking on your hands. And see the world hanging upside down. You can understand dependence. When you know the maker's land. So make your siren's call. And sing all you want. I will not hear what you have to say. Cause I need freedom now. And I need to know how. To live my life as it's meant to be. And I will hold on hope. And I won't let you choke. On the noose around your neck. And I'll find strength in pain. And I will change my ways. I'll know my name as it's called againOn my waist, through my hair..

We were always just that close. Wrist to wrist. Toe to toe. Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose. So how come when I reach out my fingers. It feels like more than distance between us. In this California king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart. I bet California wishing on these stars. For your heart, for me. My California king. Eye to eye. Cheek to cheek. Side by side. You were sleeping next to me. Arm in arm. Dusk to dawn. With the curtains drawn. And a little last night on these sheets. So how come when I reach out my fingers. It seems like more than distance between us. In this California king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart. I bet California wishing on these stars. For your heart, for me. My California king. Guitar##. Just when I felt like giving up on us. You turned around and gave me one last touch. That made everything feel better. And even then my eyes got wetter. So confused when I asked you if you love me. But I don't wanna seem so weak. Maybe I've been California dreaming. In this California king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart. I bet California wishing on these stars. For your heart, for me. My California king. Guitar##. My California King. In this California king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart.

So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms. But we don't need to rush this. Let's just take it slow. Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight. Just a touch of the fire burning so bright.

What she wears, what she wears, what she wears. Birds singing on my shoulder in harmony it seems. How they sing, how they sing, how they sing. Give me nights of solitude, red wine, just a glass or two. Reclined in a hammock on a balmy evening. I'll pretend that it's no thing that's skipping my heart when I think. Of you thinking of me, babe, I'm crazy over you. Aaah Aaah Aaah. there's something in the water, something in the water. Aaah Aaah Aaah. There's something in the water that makes me love you like.

You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time. I need a doctor, call me a doctor. I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life. I told the world one day, I would pay it back. Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back. But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that. Y'all starting to creep in, everyday it's just so gray and black. Hope, I just need a ray of that. 'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em. They just say it's whack, they don't know what dope is. And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this. All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest. You picked me up, breathing life in me, I owe my life to you. but for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do. But it just dawned on me, you lost a son. See this light in you, it's dark. Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you. I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue. 'Cause me and you were like a crew. I was like your sidekick, you gon' either wanna fight me. When I get off this fucking mic or you gon' hug me. But I'm not an option, there's nothing else I can do 'cause. I'm about to lose my mind. You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time. I need a doctor, call me a doctor. I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life. It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas. You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled. 'Cause the shit I hear is crazy but you're either getting lazy. Or you don't believe in you no more. Seems like your own opinion's not one you can form. Can't make a decision, you keep questioning yourself. Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help. Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fucking be my mentor. I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are. It was you who believed in me. When everyone was telling you don't sign me. Everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth. You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you. Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy Dre. I'm crying in this booth. You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours. But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more. But I ain't giving up faith, and you ain't giving up on me. Get up Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake. I'm about to lose my mind. You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time. I need a doctor, call me a doctor. I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life. Bring me back to life, bring me back to life, bring me back to life. I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life. It literally feels like a lifetime ago. But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though. You walked in, yellow jumpsuit, whole room, cracked jokes. But once you got inside the booth, told you like smoke. Went through friends, some of them I put on. But they just left, they said they was riding to the death. But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them. I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim. Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him. Fucking backstabbers. When the chips were down, you just laughed at us. Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, fagots. You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?. You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots, and the cracker's ass. Little crackerjack beat, making wack mass. Backwards producers, I'm back bastards. One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving. I'll guarantee they scream, Dre don't leave us like that man 'cause. I'm about to lose my mind. You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time. I need a doctor, call me a doctor. I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to lifefeat. Ludacris. .

We must stand together. There's no giving in. Hand in hand forever. That's when we all win. That's that's that's when we all win. That's that's that's when we all win. The right thing to guide us. Is right here, inside us. No one can divide us. When the light is nearly gone. But just like a heartbeat. The drumbeat carries on. The drumbeat carries on. -just like a hearbeat-. We must stand together. There's no giving in. Hand in hand forever. That's when we all win. That's that's that's when we all win. That's that's that's when we all win.It's a beautiful night.

Bye bye girlYeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road,. Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.. Smoke rollin' out the window,. An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.. Memory lane up in the headlights,. It's got me reminiscing on them good times.. I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,. I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.. Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go.. Load the truck up, hit the dirt road.. Jump the barbwire, spread the word.. Light the bonfire, then call the girls.. The king in the can and the Marlboro man.. Jack'n'Jim were a few good men.. Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too.. Better watch out for the boys in blue.. And all this small town he said, she said,. Ain't it funny how rumors spread.. Like I know something ya'll don't know,. Man that talk is gettin' old.. Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth,. Before I have to knock that loud mouth out.. Im tired of talkin, man, ya'll ain't listenin',. Them old dirt roads is what ya'll missin'.. I'm chillin' on a dirt road.. Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.. Smoke rollin' out the window,. An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.. Memory lane up in the headlights,. It's got me reminiscing on them good times.. I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,. I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.. I sit back and think about them good ole days.. The way we were raised, and our southern ways,. And we like cornbread, and biscuits,. And if it's broke round here we fix it.. I can take ya'll where ya need to go,. Down to my hood, back in them woods.. We do it different 'round here, that's right,. But we sure do it good, and we do it all night.. See, if you really wanna know how it feels,. To get off the road with trucks and four wheels,. Jump on in, and man, tell your friends,. We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends.. I'm chillin' on a dirt road.. Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.. Smoke rollin' out the window,. An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.. Memory lane up in the headlights,. It's got me reminiscing on them good times.. I'm turning off of real life, driving that's right,. I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.. Thats right.. Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road.. Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.. Smoke rollin' out the window,. An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.. Memory lane up in the headlights,. It's got me reminiscing on them good times.. I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,. I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.. Thats right.Now and then, I think of when we were together. Like when you said you felt so happy you could die. Told myself that you were right for me. But felt so lonely in your company. But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember. You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness. Like resignation to the end, always the end. So when we found that we could not make sense. Well, you said that we would still be friends. But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over. But you didn't have to cut me off. Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing. And I don't even need your love. But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough. No, you didn't have to stoop so low. Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number. I guess that I don't need that though. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over. But had me believing it was always something that I'd done. But I don't wanna live that way. Reading into every word you say. You said that you could let it go. And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know. But you didn't have to cut me off. Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing. And I don't even need your love. But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough. No, you didn't have to stoop so low. Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number. I guess that I don't need that though. Now you're just somebody that I used to know. Somebody (I used to know). Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know). Somebody (I used to know). Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know). I used to know. That I used to know. I used to know. SomebodyI threw a wish in the well. Don't ask me, I'll never tell. I looked to you as it fell. and now you're in my way. I trade my soul for a wish. pennies and dimes for a kiss. I wasn't looking for this. but now you're in my way. Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin'. Hot night, wind was blowin'. Where you think you're going, baby?. Hey, I just met you. and this is crazy. but here's my number. so call me, maybe?. It's hard to look right. at you baby. but here's my number. so call me, maybe?. Hey, I just met you. and this is crazy. but here's my number. so call me, maybe?. And all the other boys. try to chase me. but here's my number. so call me, maybe?. You took your time with the call. I took no time with the fall. You gave me nothing at all. but still, you're in my way. I beg, and borrow and steal. Have foresight and it's real. I didn't know I would feel it. but it's in my way. Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin'. Hot night, wind was blowin'. Where you think you're going, baby?. Hey, I just met you. and this is crazy. but here's my number. so call me, maybe?. It's hard to look right. at you baby. but here's my number. so call me, maybe?. Hey, I just met you. and this is crazy. but here's my number. so call me, maybe?. And all the other boys. try to chase me. but here's my number. so call me, maybe?. Before you came into my life. I missed you so bad. I missed you so bad. I missed you so, so bad. Before you came into my life. I missed you so bad. And you should know that. I missed you so, so bad. It's hard to look right. at you baby. but here's my number. so call me, maybe?. Hey, I just met you. and this is crazy. but here's my number. so call me, maybe?. And all the other boys. try to chase me. but here's my number. so call me, maybe?. Before you came into my life. I missed you so bad. I missed you so bad. I missed you so so bad. Before you came into my life. I missed you so bad. And you should know that. So call me, maybe?Give me a second, I. I need to get my story straight. My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State. My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar. My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar and. I know I gave it to you months ago. I know you're trying to forget. But between the drinks and subtle things. The holes in my apologies, you know. I'm trying hard to take it back. So if by the time the bar closes. And you feel like falling down. I'll carry you home. Tonight. We are young. So let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun. Tonight. We are young. So let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun. Now I know that I'm not all that you got. I guess that I, I just thought. Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart. But our friends are back. So let's raise a toast. 'Cause I found someone to carry me home. Tonight. We are young. So let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun. Tonight. We are young. So let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun. Carry me home tonight. Just carry me home tonight. Carry me home tonight. Just carry me home tonight. The moon is on my side. I have no reason to run. So will someone come and carry me home tonight. The angels never arrived. But I can hear the choir. So will someone come and carry me home. Tonight. We are young. So let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun. Tonight. We are young. So let's set the world on fire. We can burn brighter than the sun. So if by the time the bar closes. And you feel like falling down. I'll carry you home tonightROMANIZED. . Oppan gang-namseutayil. Kang-namseutayil. . Naje-neun ttasaroun inkanjeo-gin yeoja.

Think that I'd come running back. Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Stand a little taller. Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone. What doesn't kill you makes a fighter. Footsteps even lighter. Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger. Just me, myself and I. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Stand a little taller. Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone. You heard that I was starting over with someone new. They told you I was moving on, over you. You didn't think that I'd come back. I'd come back swinging. You try to break me, but you see. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Stand a little taller. Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone. What doesn't kill you makes a fighter. Footsteps even lighter. Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger. Just me, myself and I. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Stand a little taller. Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone. Thanks to you I got a new thing started. Thanks to you I'm not the broken hearted. Thanks to you I'm finally thinking about me. You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning. In the end. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Stand a little taller. Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone. What doesn't kill you makes a fighter. Footsteps even lighter. Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger.

For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going. Just get your ass back home. We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions. So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing, and. Sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact. When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at. Or what day in the week in the middle of the month In a year I don't recall. It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long. That was last November now December's almost gone. I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong, I don't know. I don't know where you're going. Or when you're coming home. I left the keys under the mat. To our front door (that's love). For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going. Just get your ass back home. And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted. Half of these birds would've flew the coup but you, you truly understand it. And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness. You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it. Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk. Like we don't hear what they saying. Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk. We'll just drive by and keep waving. Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it. Now they all choked up, yuck - cause they be swallowin' it. I don't know where you're going. Or when you're coming home. I left the keys under the mat. To our front door (that's love). For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going. Just get your ass back home. No one holds me down like you do sweetheart. You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this. We'll be alright, trust that. We put the "us" in "trust" baby, let's go!. I don't care what your after. As long as I'm the one, no. I don't care why you're leaving. You'll miss me when you're gone. I don't know where you're going. Or when you're coming home. I left the keys under the mat. To our front door (that's love). For one more chance to hold you close. I don't know where you're going. Just get your ass back home. (Travis). I'm home babyThis is more than a typical kinda thing. Felt the jones in my bones when you were touching me, oh oh. Didn't want to take it slow.

That's where I have to go. To see your beautiful. Face anymore I stare at a picture of you. And listen to the radio. Hope, hope there's a conversation. We both admit we had it good. But until then it's alienation. I know that much is understood. And I realise. If you ask me how I'm doing. I would say I'm doing just fine. I would lie and say that you're not on my mind. But I go out, and I sit down at a table set for two. And finally I'm forced to face the truth. No matter what I say I'm. Not over you. Not over you. Damn, damn girl you do it well. and I thought you were innocent. Took this heart and put it through hell. but still your magnificent. I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me. I turn around and I'm back in the game. even better than the old me. But I'm not even close without you. If you ask me how I'm doing. I would say I'm doing just fine. I would lie and say that you're not on my mind. But I go out, and I sit down at a table set for two. And finally I'm forced to face the truth. No matter what I say I'm. Not over you. And if I had the chance to re-new. You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do. I could get back, on the right track. But only if you'd be convinced. So until then. If you ask me how I'm doing. I would say I'm doing just fine. I would lie and say that you're not on my mind. But I go out, and I sit down at a table set for two. And finally I'm forced to face the truth.

I'll take the highroad like I should!. You said it's meant to be. that it's not you, it's me. You're leaving now for my own good. That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are. I'm gonna say:. She went down in an airplane. Fried getting suntan. Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand. Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!. She met a shark under water. Fell and no one caught her. I returned everything I ever bought her. Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies. And ways to say you died. My pride still feels the sting. You were my everything. Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours). She'll think I'm Superman. Not super minivan. How could you leave on Yom Kippur?. That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say. She was caught in a mudslide. Eaten by a lion. Got run over by a crappy purple Scion. Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!. She dried up in the desert. Drowned in a hot tub. Danced to death at an east side night club. Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies. And ways to say you died. I wanna live a thousand lives with you. I wanna be the one you're dying to. Love... but you don't want to. That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say. That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say. She went down in an airplane. Fried getting suntan. Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand. Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!. She met a shark under water. Fell and no one caught her. I returned everything I ever bought her. Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies. She was caught in a mudslide;. Eaten by a lion;. Got run over by a crappy purple Scion.. Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!. She dried up in the desert;. Drowned in a hot tub;. Danced to death at an east side night club.. Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies. And ways to say you died.No more tears, my heart is dry. I don't laugh and I don't cry. I don't think about you all the time. But when I do - I wonder why. You have to go out of my door. And leave just like you did before. I know I said that I was sure. But rich men can't imagine poor.. One day baby, we'll be old. Oh baby, we'll be old. And think about all the stories that we could have told. Little me and little you. Kept doing all the things they do. They never really think it through. Like I can never think you're true. Here I go again - the blame. The guilt, the pain, the hurt, the shame. The founding fathers of our plane. That's stuck in heavy clouds of rain.. One day baby, we'll be old. Oh baby, we'll be old. And think about all the stories that we could have told.Ich wart seit Wochen, auf diesen Tag. und tanz vor Freude, über den Asphalt. Als wär's ein Rythmus, als gäb's ein Lied. Das mich immer weiter, durch die Straßen zieht. Komm dir entgegen, dich abzuholen, wie ausgemacht. Zu der selben Uhrzeit, am selben Treffpunkt, wie letztes mal. . Durch das Gedränge, der Menschenmenge. Bahnen wir uns den altbekannten Weg. Entlang der Gassen, zu den Rheinterrassen. Über die Brücken, bis hin zu der Musik. Wo alles laut ist, wo alle drauf sind, um durchzudreh'n. Wo die Anderen warten, um mit uns zu starten, und abzugeh'n. . An Tagen wie diesen, wünscht man sich Unendlichkeit. An Tagen wie diesen, haben wir noch ewig Zeit. Wünsch ich mir Unendlichkeit. . Das hier ist ewig,ewig für heute. Wir steh'n nicht still, für eine ganze Nacht. Komm ich trag dich,durch die Leute. Hab keine Angst, ich gebe auf dich Acht. Wir lassen uns treiben, tauchen unter, schwimmen mit dem Strom. Dreh'n unsere Kreise, kommen nicht mehr runter, sind schwerelos. . An Tagen wie diesen, wünscht man sich Unendlichkeit. An Tagen wie diesen, haben wir noch ewig Zeit. In dieser Nacht der Nächte, die uns so viel verspricht. Erleben wir das Beste, kein Ende ist in Sicht. . Kein Ende in Sicht. Kein Ende in Sicht. Kein Ende in Sicht. . An Tagen wie diesen, wünscht man sich Unendlichkeit. An Tagen wie diesen, haben wir noch ewig Zeit. In dieser Nacht der Nächte, die uns so viel verspricht. Erleben wir das Beste, kein Ende ist in Sicht. Erleben wir das Beste, und kein Ende ist in Sicht. Kein Ende in SichtI was there to witness, candices inner business. She wants the boys to notice her rainbows and her ponies. She was educated, but could not count to ten. Now she got lots of different horses by lots of different men. And I say: "Liberate your sons and daughters". The bush is high, but in the hole there's water. You can get some, when they give it. Nothing sacred, but it's a living. Hey ho, here she goes, either a little too high or a little too low. Got no self-esteem and vertigo, cause she thinks she's made of candy. Hey ho, here she goes, either a little too loud or a little too close. Got a hurricane at the back of her throat and she thinks she's made of candy. Ring a ring of roses, whoever gets the closest. She comes and she goes as the war of the roses. Mother was a victim, father beat the system by moving bricks to Brixton and learning how to fix them. Liberate your sons and daughters. The bush is high, but in the hole there's water. "As you will" shall be the whole of the law. And if it don't feel good what are you doing it for?. Now tell me. Hey ho, here she goes, either a little too high or a little too low. Got no self-esteem and vertigo, cause she thinks she's made of candy. Hey ho, here she goes, either a little too loud or a little too close. Got a hurricane at the back of her throat and she thinks she's made of candy. Liberate your sons and daughters. The bush is high, but in the hole there's water. "As you will" shall be the whole of the law. And if it don't feel good what are you doing it for?. What are you doing it for?. What are you doing it for?. What are you doing it for?. What are you doing it for?. What are you doing it for?. What are you doing it for?. What are you doing it for?. What are you doing it for?. Hey ho, here she goes, either a little too high or a little too low. Got no self-esteem and vertigo, cause she thinks she's made of candy. Hey ho, here she goes, either a little too loud or a little too close. Got a hurricane at the back of her throat and she thinks she's made of candy. Hey ho, here she goes, either a little too high or a little too low. Got no self-esteem and vertigo, cause she thinks she's made of candy. Hey ho, here she goes, either a little too loud or a little too close. There's a hurricane at the back of her throat and she thinks she's made of candyGoing nowhere fast. We've reached our climax. We're together, now we're undone. Won't commit so we choose to. Run away. Do we separate?. Don't wanna give in so we both gave up. Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax. Climax. I've fallen somehow. Feet off the ground. Love is the cloud. That keeps raining down. Where are you now?. When I need you around. I'm on my knees, but it seems we're. Going nowhere fast. We've reached our climax. We're together, now we're undone. Won't commit so we choose to. Run away. Do we separate?. Don't wanna give in so we both gave up. Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax. Climax. I gave my best, it wasn't enough. You get upset, we argue too much. We made our mess, what used to be love. So why do I care, I care at all. At all. At all. At all. Going nowhere fast. We've reached our climax. We're together, now we're undone. Won't commit so we choose to. Run away. Do we separate?. Don't wanna give in so we both gave up. Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax. Climax. You say it's better if we. Love each other separately. I just need you one more time. I can't get what we had out my mind. Where are you now. When I need you around. I'm on my knees. But it seems we're going. Going nowhere fast. We've reached our climax. We're together, now we're undone. Won't commit so we choose to. Run away. Do we separate?. Oh.Don't wanna give in so we both gave up. Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax. ClimaxSuddenly you're here. Suddenly it starts. Can two anxious hearts beat as one?. Yesterday I was alone. Today you walk beside me. Something still unclear. Something not yet here has begun.. Suddenly the world. Seems a different place. Somehow full of grace, full of light.. How was I to know that so much hope was held inside me?. What has passed is gone. Now we journey on through the night. How was I to know at last that happiness can come so fast?. Trusting me the way you do. I’m so afraid of failing you. Just a child who cannot know that danger follows where I go. There are shadows everywhere. And memories I cannot share. Nevermore alone. Nevermore apart. You have warmed my heart like the sun.. You have brought the gift of life. And love so long denied me.. Suddenly I see. What I could not see. Something suddenly. Has begun.When we first came here. we were cold and we were clear. with no colours in our skin. we were light and paper's thin. When we first came here. we were cold and we were clear. with no colours in our skin. till you let the spectrum in. Say my name. and every colours illuminates. we are shining. and we will never be afraid again. Say my name. and every colour illuminates. we are shining. and we will never be afraid again. And we come for you. we'll be dressed up all in blue. with the ocean in my arms. kiss your eyes and kiss your palms. And when it's time to pray. we'll be dressed up all in grey. with metal on our tongues. and silver in our lungs. Say my name. and every colour illuminates. we are shining. and we'll never be afraid again. Say my name. as every colour illuminates. we are shining. and we'll never be afraid again. Say my name. and every colour illuminates. and we'll never be afraid again. And we come back. we'll be dressed in black. and you'll scream our names aloud. and we won't eat and we won't sleep. we'll drag bodies from their graves. Say my name. and every colour it illuminates. and we are shining. and we'll never be afraid again. Say my name. as every colour illuminates. Say my name. as every colour illuminates. we are shining. and we'll never be afraid again. Say my name. and every colour illuminates. Say my name. we are shining. Say my name. and we'll never be afraid againWe took it all apart but I'm wishing I'd stayed. In the back room something I heard you say. We didn't wanna call it too early. Now it seems a world away but I miss that day. Are we ever gonna feel the same?. Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds. Someone had to draw a line. We'll be coming back for you one day. We'll be coming back for you one day. I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds. Sad to leave it all behind. We'll be coming back. We'll be coming back for you one day. You can see it from afar, we were riding that wave. Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave. We didn't want to call it too early. Now it seems a world away but I miss that day. Are we ever gonna feel the same?. Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds. Someone had to draw a line. We'll be coming back for you one day. We'll be coming back for you one day. I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds. Sad to leave it all behind. We'll be coming back for you one day. We'll be coming back for you one day. Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart. And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts. Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars. And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts. Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds. Someone had to draw a line. We'll be coming back for you one day. We'll be coming back for you one day. I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds. Sad to leave it all behind. We'll be coming back for you one day. We'll be coming back for you one day[Featuring: Justin Bieber]. . [Intro - Justin Bieber]. I'm gonna live my life. No matter what, we party tonight. I'm gonna li-li-live my life.

I let you see the parts of me. That weren't all that pretty. And with every touch you fixed them. . Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh. Things you never say to me, oh, oh. Tell me that you've had enough. Of our love, our love. . Just give me a reason. Just a little bit's enough. Just a second we're not broken just bent. And we can learn to love again. It's in the stars. It's been written in the scars on our hearts. We're not broken just bent. And we can learn to love again. . I'm sorry I don't understand. Where all of this is coming from. I thought that we were fine. (Oh, we had everything). Your head is running wild again. My dear we still have everythin'. And it's all in your mind. (Yeah, but this is happenin'). . You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh. You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh. There's nothing more than empty sheets. Between our love, our love. Oh, our love, our love. . Just give me a reason. Just a little bit's enough. Just a second we're not broken just bent. And we can learn to love again. I never stopped. You're still written in the scars on my heart. You're not broken just bent. And we can learn to love again. . Oh, tear ducts and rust. I'll fix it for us. We're collecting dust. But our love's enough. You're holding it in. You're pouring a drink. No nothing is as bad as it seems. Well complete. . Just give me a reason. Just a little bit's enough. Just a second we're not broken just bent.

And we can learn to love againI used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. Scared to rock the boat and make a mess. So I sat quietly. Agreed politely. I guess that I forgot I had a choice. I let you push me past the breaking point. I stood for nothing. So I fell for everything. You held me down, but I got up. Already brushing off the dust. You hear my voice, You hear that sound. Like thunder gonna shake the ground. You held me down, but I got up. Get ready 'cause I've had enough. I see it all, I see it now. I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter,. dancing through the fire. Cause I am a champion and. You're gonna hear me ROAR. Louder, louder than a lion. Cause I am a champion and. You're gonna hear me ROAR. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. You're gonna hear me roar. Now I'm floating like a butterfly. Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes. I went from zero, to my own hero. You held me down, but I got up. Already brushing off the dust. You hear my voice, You hear that sound. Like thunder gonna shake the ground. You held me down, but I got up. Get ready 'cause I've had enough. I see it all, I see it now. I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter,. dancing through the fire. Cause I am a champion and. You're gonna hear me ROAR. Louder, louder than a lion. Cause I am a champion and. You're gonna hear me ROAR. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. You're gonna hear me roar. Roar-or, roar-or, roar-or. I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter,. dancing through the fire. Cause I am a champion and. You're gonna hear me ROAR. Louder, louder than a lion. Cause I am a champion and. You're gonna hear me ROAR. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. You're gonna hear me roarI'm friends with the monster that's under my bed. Get along with the voices inside of my head. You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath. And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy. I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek. Oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey. Wanted to receive attention for my music. Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me. For wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways. Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated. When I blew; see, but it was confusing. 'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf. Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!). Hit the lottery, oh wee. But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet. It was like winning a used mink. Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink. I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep. Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith. But I'm actually weirder than you think. 'Cause I'm. I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed. Get along with the voices inside of my head. You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath. And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy. Well, that's nothing. Well, that's nothing. Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me. To seize the moment and don't squander it. 'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow. So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from. (Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.. No wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.). Yoda-loda-le-hee-hoo. I think it went wandering off down yonder. And stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVonderen. 'Cause I need an interventionist. To intervene between me and this monster. And save me from myself and all this conflict. 'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it. My OCD's conking me in the head. Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking. I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying. Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the. I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed. Get along with the voices inside of my head. You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath. And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy. Well, that's nothing. Well, that's nothing. Call me crazy but I have this vision. One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian. But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at. MC's, blood get spilled and I'll. Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track. Give every kid who got played that. Pumped up feeling and shit to say back. To the kids who played him. I ain't here to save the fucking children. But if one kid out of a hundred million. Who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great. It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back. In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that. Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack. Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts. I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that. It's nothing, I'm still friends with the. I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed. Get along with the voices inside of my head. You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath. And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy. Well, that's nothing. Well, that's nothingLike the legend of the phoenix. All ends with beginnings. What keeps the planet spinning. The force from the beginning. (Look). We've come too far to give up who we are.

We kissed, I fell under your spell. A love no one could deny. Don't you ever say I just walked away. I will always want you. I can't live a lie, running for my life. I will always want you. I came in like a wrecking ball. I never hit so hard in love. All I wanted was to break your walls. All you ever did was wreck me. Yeah you, you wreck me. I put you high up in the sky. And now, you're not coming down. It slowly turned, you let me burn. And now, we're ashes on the ground. Don't you ever say I just walked away. I will always want you. I can't live a lie, running for my life. I will always want you. I came in like a wrecking ball. I never hit so hard in love. All I wanted was to break your walls. All you ever did was wreck me. I came in like a wrecking ball. Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung. Left me crashing in a blazing fall. All you ever did was wreck me. Yeah you, you wreck me. I never meant to start a war. I just wanted you to let me in. And instead of using force. I guess I should've let you in. I never meant to start a war. I just wanted you to let me in. I guess I should've let you win. Don't you ever say I just walked away. I will always want you. I came in like a wrecking ball. I never hit so hard in love. All I wanted was to break your walls. All you ever did was wreck me. I came in like a wrecking ball. Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung. Left me crashing in a blazing fall. All you ever did was wreck me. Yeah you, you wreck me. Yeah you, you wreck meWell, you only need the light when it's burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you've been high when you're feeling low. Only hate the road when you're missing home. Only know you love her when you let her go. And you let her go. Staring at the bottom of your glass. Hoping one day you'll make a dream last. But dreams come slow, and they go so fast. You see her when you close your eyes. Maybe one day you'll understand why. Everything you touch surely dies. But you only need the light when it's burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you've been high when you're feeling low. Only hate the road when you're missing home. Only know you love her when you let her go. Staring at the ceiling in the dark. Same old empty feeling in your heart. 'Cause love comes slow, and it goes so fast. Well, you see her when you fall asleep. But never to touch and never to keep. 'Cause you loved her too much, and you dived too deep. Well, you only need the light when it's burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you've been high when you're feeling low. Only hate the road when you're missing home. Only know you love her when you let her go. And you let her go. And you let her go. Well, you let her go. 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you've been high when you're feeling low. Only hate the road when you're missing home. Only know you love her when you let her go. 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you've been high when you're feeling low. Only hate the road when you're missing home. Only know you love her when you let her go. And you let her goAren't you something to admire, 'cause your shine is something like a mirror. And I can't help but notice, you reflect in this heart of mine. If you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find. Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side. 'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul. I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go. Just put your hand on the glass, I'm here trying to pull you through. You just gotta be strong. 'Cause I don't wanna lose you now. I'm looking right at the other half of me. The vacancy that sat in my heart. Is a space that now you hold. Show me how to fight for now. And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy. Coming back into you once I figured it out. You were right here all along. It's like you're my mirror. My mirror staring back at me. I couldn't get any bigger. With anyone else beside of me. And now it's clear as this promise. That we're making two reflections into one. 'Cause it's like you're my mirror. My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me. Aren't you something, an original, 'cause it doesn't seem merely assembled. And I can't help but stare 'cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes. Ooh I can't ever change without you, you reflect me, I love that about you. And if I could, I would look at us all the time. 'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul. I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go. Just put your hand on the past, I'm here trying to pull you through. You just gotta be strong. 'Cause I don't wanna lose you now.

And now it's clear as this promise. That we're making two reflections into one. 'Cause it's like you're my mirror. My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me. Yesterday is history. Tomorrow's a mystery. I can see you looking back at me. Keep your eyes on me. Baby, keep your eyes on me. 'Cause I don't wanna lose you now. I'm looking right at the other half of me. The vacancy that sat in my heart. Is a space that now you hold. Show me how to fight for now. And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy. Coming back into you once I figured it out. You were right here all along. It's like you're my mirror. My mirror staring back at me. I couldn't get any bigger. With anyone else beside of me. And now it's clear as this promise.

You are you are the love of my life. You are you are the love of my life. You are you are the love of my life. You are you are the love of my life. Now you're the inspiration for this precious song. And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on. So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone. And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home. Just to let you know, you are. You are you are the love of my life. You are you are the love of my life. You are you are the love of my life. You are you are the love of my life.

Hey, sister. Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker.. Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you,. There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.. Hey, brother. Do you still believe in one another?. Hey, sister. Do you still believe in love, I wonder?. Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you,. There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.. What if I'm far from home?. Oh, brother. I will hear you call.. What if I lose it all?. Oh, sister. I will help you out!. Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you,. There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.. Hey, brother. There's an endless road to rediscover.. Hey, sister. Do you still believe in love, I wonder?. Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you,. There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.. What if I'm far from home?. Oh, brother. I will hear you call.. What if I lose it all?. Oh, sister. I will help you out!. Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you,. There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.When I was in the 3rd grade. I thought that I was gay. 'Cause I could draw, my uncle was. And I kept my room straight. I told my mom, tears rushing down my face. She's like, "Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K". Tripping yeah. I guess she had a point, didn't she. A bunch of stereotypes all in my head. I remember doing the math like. "Yeah, I'm good at little league". A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant. For those that like the same sex had the characteristics. The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision. And you can be cured with some treatment and religion. Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition. Playing God. Ahh nah, here we go. America the brave. Still fears what we don't know. And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten. But we paraphrase a book written. 35 hundreds years ago. I don't know. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. My love, my love, my love. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. If I was gay. I would think hip-hop hates me. Have you read the YouTube comments lately?. "Man that's gay". Gets dropped on the daily. We've become so numb to what we're saying. Our culture founded from oppression. Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em. Call each other faggots. Behind the keys of a message board. A word rooted in hate. Yet our genre still ignores it. Gay is synonymous with the lesser. It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion. Gender to skin color. The complexion of your pigment. The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins. Human rights for everybody. There is no difference. Live on! And be yourself!. When I was in church. They taught me something else. If you preach hate at the service. Those words aren't anointed. And that Holy Water. That you soak in. Is then poisoned. When everyone else. Is more comfortable. Remaining voiceless. Rather than fighting for humans. That have had their rights stolen. I might not be the same. But that's not important. No freedom til we're equal. Damn right I support it. I don't know. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. My love, my love, my love. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. We press play. Don't press pause. Progress, march on!. With a veil over our eyes. We turn our back on the cause. 'Till the day. That my uncles can be united by law. Kids are walkin' around the hallway. Plagued by pain in their heart. A world so hateful. Some would rather die. Than be who they are. And a certificate on paper. Isn't gonna solve it all. But it's a damn good place to start. No law's gonna change us. We have to change us. Whatever God you believe in. We come from the same one. Strip away the fear. Underneath it's all the same love. About time that we raised up. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. My love, my love, my love. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. Love is patient, love is kind. Love is patient. Love is kind (not crying on Sundays). Love is patient (not crying on Sundays). Love is kind (not crying on Sundays). Love is patient (not crying on Sundays). Love is kind (not crying on Sundays). Love is patient (not crying on Sundays). Love is kind (not crying on Sundays). Love is patient, love is kindWritten in these walls are the stories that I can't explain. I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days. She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones. It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone. And I'll be gone gone tonight. The ground beneath my feet is open wide. The way that I been holdin' on too tight. With nothing in between. The story of my life I take her home. I drive all night to keep her warm and time. Is frozen (the story of, the story of). The story of my life I give her hope. I spend her love until she's broke inside. The story of my life (the story of, the story of). Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change. Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage. I know that in the morning now. I'll see us in the light upon a hill. Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still. And I'll be gone gone tonight. The fire beneath my feet is burning bright. The way that I been holdin' on so tight. With nothing in between. The story of my life I take her home. I drive all night to keep her warm and time. Is frozen (the story of, the story of). The story of my life I give her hope. I spend her love until she's broke inside. The story of my life (the story of, the story of). And I been waiting for this time to come around. But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds. The story of my life I take her home. I drive all night to keep her warm and time. is frozen. The story of my life I give her hope (give her hope). I spend her love until she's broke inside (until she's broke inside).

Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle. Every little farm town with you. Baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.

Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check. I don't ever want to let you down. I don't ever want to leave this town. 'Cause after all. This city never sleeps at night. It's time to begin, isn't it?. I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit. I'm just the same as I was. Now don't you understand. That I'm never changing who I am. So this is where you fell. And I am left to sell. The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell. Right to the top. Don't look back. Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain-check. I don't ever want to let you down. I don't ever want to leave this town. 'Cause after all. This city never sleeps at night. It's time to begin, isn't it?. I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit. I'm just the same as I was. Now don't you understand. That I'm never changing who I am. It's time to begin, isn't it?.

That I'm never changing who I am. It's time to begin, isn't it?. I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit. I'm just the same as I was. Don't you understand. That I'm never changing who I amI don't wanna be left behind. Distance was a friend of mine. Catching breath in a web of lies. I've spent most of my life. Riding waves, playing acrobat. Shadowboxing the other half. Learning how to react. I've spent most of my time. Catching my breath, Letting it go,. Turning my cheek, For the sake of this show. Now that you know, this is my life,. I won't be told what's supposed to be right. Catch my breath,. No one can hold me back,. I ain't got time for that. Catch my breath,. Won't let them let me down,. It's all so simple now. Addicted to the love i found. Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud. Making time for the ones that count. I'll spend the rest of my time. Laughing hard with the windows down. Leaving footprints all over town. Keeping faith when it comes around. I will spent the rest of my life. Catching my breath, Letting it go,. Turning my cheek For the sake of this show. Now that you know, this is my life,. I won't be told what's supposed to be right. Catch my breath,. No one can hold me back,. I ain't got time for that. Catch my breath,. Won't let them let me down,.

Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored. Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it. Never not chasing a million things I want. And I am only as young as the minute is full of it. Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought. But I know they'll never own me. (Yeah). Baby be the class clown. I'll be the beauty queen in tears. It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah). We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear. Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah). Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane. I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space. But my head's filling up fast with the wicked games, up in flames. How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known. And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them. Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne. But I know it's not forever. (Yeah). Baby be the class clown. I'll be the beauty queen in tears.

You light the spark in my bonfire heart. People like us, we don't. Need that much. Just someone that starts. Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts. This world is getting colder, strangers passing by. No one offers you a shoulder, no one looks you in the eye. But I've been looking at you for a long, long time.

I can't find your silver lining. I don't mean to judge. But when you read your speech, it's tiring. Enough is enough. I'm covering my ears like a kid. When your words mean nothing, I go la la la.

Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale. I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you. But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide. No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed. This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come. When you feel my heat, look into my eyes. It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide. Don't get too close, it's dark inside. It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide. At the curtain's call is the last of all. When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl. So they dug your grave and the masquerade. Will come calling out at the mess you made. I Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound. Though this is all for you I don't want to hide the truth. No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed. This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come. When you feel my heat, look into my eyes. It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide. Don't get too close, it's dark inside. It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide. They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate. It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go. Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save their light. I can't escape this now, unless you show me how. When you feel my heat, look into my eyes. It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide. Don't get too close, it's dark inside. It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hideI've got my ticket for the long way ‘round.

I will love you (unconditionally). I will love you. I will love you unconditionallyWell I woke up to the sound of silence the cars. Were cutting like knives in a fist fight. And I found you with a bottle of wine. Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July. You swore and said we are not. We are not shining stars. This I know. I never said we are. Though I've never been through hell like that. I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back. If you're lost and alone. Or you're sinking like a stone. Carry on. May your past be the sound. Of your feet upon the ground. Carry on. Carry on, carry on. So I met up with some friends in the edge of the night. At a bar off seventy five. And we talked and talked about how our parents will die. All our neighbors and wives. But I like to think I can cheat it all. To make up for the times, I've been cheated on. And it's nice to know when I was left for dead. I was found and now I don't roam these streets. I am not the ghost you want of me. If you're lost and alone. Or you're sinking like a stone. Carry on. May your past be the sound. Of your feet upon the ground and. Carry on. Woah, my head is on fire, but my legs are fine. After all they are mine. Lay your clothes down on the floor. Close the door, hold the phone, show me how. No one's ever gonna stop us now. 'Cause we are, we are shining stars. We are invincible, we are who we are. On our darkest day, when we're miles away. So we'll come, we will find our way home. If you're lost and alone. Or you're sinking like a stone. Carry on. May your past be the sound. Of your feet upon the ground and. Carry on. No one's ever gonna stop us now. No one's ever, no one's ever gonna stop. No one's ever gonna stop us now. No one's ever, no one's ever gonna stop. No one's ever gonna stop, no one's ever gonna stop us now105 is the number that comes to my head. When I think of all the years I wanna be with you. Wake up every morning with you in my bed. That's precisely what I plan to do. And you know one of these days when I get my money right. Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life. Will forever be enough, so there ain't no need to rush. But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough. I'll say will you marry me. I swear that I will mean it. I'll say will you marry me. How many girls in the world can make me feel like this?. Baby I don't ever plan to find out. The more I look, the more I find the reasons why. You're the love of my life. You know one of these days when I get my money right. Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life. Will forever be enough, so there ain't no need to rush.

And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days. Until then, we got nothing to say. And nothing to know. But something to drink and maybe something to smoke. Let it go until our roads are changed. Singing "we found love in a local rave", no. I don't really know what I'm supposed to say. But I can just figure it out and then hope and pray. I told her my name and said "it's nice to meet ya". Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila. I already know she's a keeper. Just from this one small act of kindness. I'm in deep if anybody finds out. I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now. Not sobering up we just sit on the couch. One thing led to another. Now she's kissing my mouth. I need you, darling. Come on, set the tone.

A kingdom of isolation. And it looks like I'm the queen. The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside. Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried. Don't let them in, don't let them see. Be the good girl you always have to be. Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know. Well, now they know. Let it go, let it go. Can't hold it back anymore. Let it go, let it go. Turn away and slam the door. I don't care. What they're going to say. Let the storm rage on. The cold never bothered me anyway. It's funny how some distance. Makes everything seem small. And the fears that once controlled me. Can't get to me at all. It's time to see what I can do. To test the limits and break through. No right, no wrong, no rules for me. I'm free. Let it go, let it go. I am one with the wind and sky. Let it go, let it go. You'll never see me cry. Here I stand and here I'll stay. Let the storm rage on. My power flurries through the air into the ground. My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around. And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast. I'm never going back, the past is in the past. Let it go, let it go. And I'll rise like the break of dawn. Let it go, let it go. That perfect girl is gone. Here I stand in the light of day. Let the storm rage on. The cold never bothered me anywayWe're a thousand miles from comfort. We have travelled land and sea. But as long as you are with me. There's no place I'd rather be. I would wait forever. Exulted in the seam. As long as I am with you. My heart continues to beat. With every step we take. Kyoto to the bay. Strolling so casually. We're different and the same. Gave you another name. Switch up the batteries. If you gave me a chance I would take it. It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it. Knowing all of your heart, you can't shame me. When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be. No, no, no, no, no! No place I'd rather be. No, no, no, no, no! No place I'd rather be. No, no, no, no, no! No place I'd rather be. We staked out on a mission. To find our inner peace. Make it everlasting. So nothing's incomplete. It's easy being with you. Sacred simplicity. As long as we're together. There's no place I rather be. With every step we take. Kyoto to the bay. Strolling so casually. We're different and the same. Gave you another name. Switch up the batteries. If you gave me a chance I would take it. It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it. Knowing all of your heart, you can't shame me. When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be.

Just starting to crawl. Say something, I'm giving up on you. I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you. Anywhere, I would've followed you. Say something, I'm giving up on you. And I will swallow my pride.

And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23. And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways. Maybe just the touch of a hand. Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day. And I just wanna tell you I am. So, honey, now. Take me into your loving arms. Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars. Place your head on my beating heart. I'm thinking out loud. Maybe we found love right where we are. When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades. And the crowds don't remember my name. When my hands don't play the strings the same way. I know you will still love me the same. 'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen. And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory. I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways. And maybe it's all part of a plan. Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes. Hoping that you'll understand. That, baby, now. Take me into your loving arms. Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars.

Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?. When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?. Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?. If what we had was real, how could you be fine?. 'Cause I'm not fine at all. I remember the day you told me you were leaving. I remember the make-up running down your face. And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them. Like every single wish we ever made. I wish that I could wake up with amnesia. And forget about the stupid little things. Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you. And the memories I never can escape. 'Cause I'm not fine at all. The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone. I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone. And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around. It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've moved on. It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long. It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?. If what we had was real, how could you be fine?. 'Cause I'm not fine at all.

I'm sleeping all these demons away. But your ghost, the ghost of you. It keeps me awake. My friends had you figured out. Yeah they saw what's inside of you. You tried hiding another you. But your evil was coming through. These eyes sitting on the wall. They watch every move I make. Bright light living in the shade. Your cold heart makes my spirit shake. I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane. Had to meet the devil just to know his name. And that's when my love was burning. Yeah it's still burning. I keep going to the river to pray. 'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain. And at most. I'm sleeping all these demons away. But your ghost, the ghost of you. It keeps me awake. I keep going to the river to pray.

The moon we love like a brother. While he glows through the room. Dancing around the lies we told. Dancing around big eyes as well, ah. Even the comatose. They don't dance and tell. We live in cities you'll never see on screen. Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things. Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams. And you know we're on each other's team. I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air. So there. So all the cups got broke. Shards beneath our feet. But it wasn't my fault. And everyone's competing. For a love they won't recieve. 'Cause what this palace wants is release. We live in cities you'll never see on screen. Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things. Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams. And you know we're on each other's team. I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air. So there. I'm kinda older than I was when I reveled without a care. So there. We live in cities you'll never see on screen. Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things.

First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray. We from nothing to something, liking to loving. It was us against the world and now we just fucking. It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you. Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you. I wanted all or nothing for us ain't no place in between. Might, might be me believing what you say that you never mean. Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long. If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song. You were different from my last but now you got it mirrored. And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer. Now sing. You used to be thirsty for me. But now you wanna be set free.

You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug . You can be the outcast . Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love . Or you can start speaking up . Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do . And they settle ‘neath your skin . Kept on the inside and no sunlight . Sometimes a shadow wins . But I wonder what would happen if you . Say what you wanna say . And let the words fall out . Honestly I wanna see you be brave . With what you want to say . And let the words fall out . Honestly I wanna see you be brave . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I wanna see you be brave . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I wanna see you be brave . Everybody’s been there, everybody’s been stared down . By the enemy . Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing . Bow down to the mighty . Don’t run, stop holding your tongue . Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live . Maybe one of these days you can let the light in . Show me how big your brave is . Say what you wanna say . And let the words fall out . Honestly I wanna see you be brave . With what you want to say . And let the words fall out . Honestly I wanna see you be brave . Innocence, your history of silence . Won’t do you any good . Did you think it would? . Let your words be anything but empty . Why don’t you tell them the truth? . Say what you wanna say . And let the words fall out . Honestly I wanna see you be brave . With what you want to say . And let the words fall out . Honestly I wanna see you be brave . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I wanna see you be brave . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I wanna see you be brave . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I wanna see you be brave . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see you . I just wanna see youLa, la, la, la. I met this girl late last year. She said don't you worry if I disappear. I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake. I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait. But then I jumped right in a week later returned. I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn. But I gave her my time for two or three nights. Then I put it on pause until the moment was right. I went away for months until our paths crossed again. She told me I was never looking for a friend. Maybe you could swing by my room around ten. Baby, bring the lemon & a bottle of gin. We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM. Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said. She's singing.... la, la, la, la. Don't with my love. That heart is so cold. All over my own. I don't wanna know that, babe. la, la, la. Don't with my love. I told her, she knows. Take aim & reload. I don't wanna know that, babe. la, la, la. For a couple of weeks I only want to see her. We drink away the days with a take away pizza. Before a text message was the only way to reach her. Now she's staying at my place & loves the way I treat her. Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature. And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either. But me & her we make money the same way. Four cities, two planes the same day. And those shows have never been what it's about. Maybe we'll go together & just figure it out. I'd rather put on a film with you & sit on the couch. But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now. Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out. When she was kissing him how I was confused about. She should figure it out why I'm sat here singing. Don't with my love. That heart is so cold. All over my own. I don't wanna know that, babe. Don't with my love. I told her, she knows. Take aim & reload. I don't wanna know that, babe. On my hotel door!. I don't even know if she knows what for. She was crying on my shoulder, I already told you. Trust & respect is what we do this for. I never intended to be next. But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all. And I never saw him as a threat. Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course. It's not like we were both on tour. We were staying on the same hotel floor. And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment. But it was never just fun & I thought you were different. This is not the way you realize what you wanted. It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest. And all this time God knows I'm singing. Don't with my love. That heart is so cold. All over my own. I don't wanna know that, babe. Don't with my love. I told her, she knows. Take aim & reload. I don't wanna know that, babe. Don't with my love. That heart is so cold. All over my own. I don't wanna know that babe. Don't with my love. I told her, she knows. Take aim & reload. I don't wanna know that, babeMy anaconda don't.

How did that girl even get in here?. Do you see her?. She's so short, and that dress is so tacky. Who wears cheetah?. It's not even summer. Why does the DJ keep on playing "Summertime Sadness"?.

And I throw it up (I throw that up). That's what it is (that's what it is). In my C A D I L L A C bitch (biatch). Can't see me through my tints (nah ah). I'm riding real slow (slow motion). In my paint wet drippin shorty like my 24's (umbrella). I ain't got 24's (no oh). But I'm on those Vogues. That's those big white walls, round them hundred spokes. Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag. I'm rolling in that same whip that my granddad had. Hello haters, damn y'all mad. 30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?. Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive. Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time. I'm blowin' that roof off, letting in sky. I shine, the city never looked so bright. Man I'm lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would've been proud of. Looking down from heaven like damn that's stylish. Smilin', don't pay attention to the mileage. Can I hit the freeway? I'm illegally going 120. Easy weaving in and out of the traffic. They cannot catch me, I'm smashing. I'm ducking bucking them out here. I'm lookin fuckin fantastic, I am up in a classic. Now I know what it's like under the city lights. Riding into the night, driving over the bridge. The same one we walked across as kids. Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this. Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater. Yea, I'm from Seattle, There's hella Honda Civics. I couldn't tell you about paint neither. But I really want the Caddy so I put in the hours. And roll on over to the dealer. And I found the car I'm dreaming of, i bargain with this geezer. Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming. Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive. Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time. I'm blowin' that roof off, letting in sky. I shine, the city never looked so bright. Backwoods and dope. White hoes in the backseat snorting coke. She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes. I had it hella my love, tryna blow her mind. Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on. 14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone. Sendin' portions of his liquor, water in the Patrón. Rather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes. (fuckin' lottery homes). Tires with the spokes on it and the vogues too. Mustard and mayonnaise, keeping the buns on ‘em. My dogs hanging out the window. Young as whoosh, fuckin like we ball. Tryna fuck em all, kill the fuckin wimps. See what's poppin' at the mall, meet a bad bitch. Slap her booty with my palms. You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls. I'm motherfuckin' awe... some. swear these eyes tryna hypnotize. Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs. See the lust stuck up in her eyes. Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?. Girl does she want it low?. This shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know. So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit. Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it. Slide till the gas is finished, Q.

Woah, Come with me now. I'm gon' show you how. Woah, Come with me now. I'm gon' take you down. Woah, Come with me now. I'm gon' show you how. Afraid to lose control. Caught up in this world. I've wasted time, I've wasted breath. I think I've thought myself to death. I was born without this fear. Now only this seems clear. I need to move, I need to fight, I need to lose myself tonight. Woah, Come with me now. I'm gon' take you down. Woah, Come with me now. I'm gon' show you how. I think with my heart and I move with my head. I open my mouth and it's something I've read. I've stood at this door before I'm told. but a part of me knows that I'm growing too old. Confused what I thought was something I felt. Confused what I feel with something that's real. I tried to sell my soul last night. Funny, you wouldn't even take a bite. Far away. I heard him say. (Come with me now). Don't delay. I heard him say. (Come with me now). Far away. I heard him say. (Come with me now). Don't delay. I heard him say. (Come with me now). Woah, Come with me now. I'm gon' take you down. Woah, Come with me now. I'm gon' show you how. Afraid to lose control.

It will be ours, it will be ours. One day when the war is won. We will be sure, we will be sure. Oh Glory. Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon. Formed against, yes glory is destined. Every day women and men become legends. Sins that go against our skin become blessings. The movement is a rhythm to us. Freedom is like religion to us. Justice is juxtapositionin' us. Justice for all just ain't specific enough. One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us. Truant livin' livin' in us, resistance is us. That's why Rosa sat on the bus. That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up. When it go down we woman and man up. They say, "Stay down", and we stand up. Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up. "King" pointed to the mountain top and we ran up. One day when the Glory comes. It will be ours, it will be ours. One day, when the war is done. We will be sure, we will be sure. Oh... Glory. Now the war is not over, victory isn't won. And we'll fight on to the finish, then when it's all done. We'll cry glory, oh glory. We'll cry glory, oh glory. Selma is now for every man, woman and child. Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd. They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now. Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles. From dark roads he rose, to become a hero. Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people. Enemy is lethal, a king became regal. Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle. The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful. We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through. Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany. Now we right the wrongs in history. No one can win the war individually. It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy. Welcome to the story we call victory. Comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the Glory. One day when the Glory comes. It will be ours, it will be ours. One day, when the war is done. We will be sure, we will be sure. Oh, Glory. When the war is won. When it's all said and done. We'll cry Glory, oh GloryFeeling my way through the darkness. Guided by a beating heart. I can't tell where the journey will end. But I know where to start. They tell me I'm too young to understand. They say I'm caught up in a dream. Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes. Well that's fine by me. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. I tried carrying the weight of the world. But I only have two hands. Hope I get the chance to travel the world. But I don't have any plans. Wish that I could stay forever this young. Not afraid to close my eyes. Life's a game made for everyone. And love is the prize. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself. And I didn't know I was lost. Didn't know I was lost. I didn't know I was lost. I didn't know I was lost. I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)Payayayayay. Payayayayay. Payayayayay. Oh payayayayay. Won't you look this way for a little while. I want you to realize I am by your side. Won't you look this way five seconds will do. Won't you look at me that's right here next to you. Although in reality even if your eyes see me. It passes by and there's no time for us to say anything. Message on a placard from my heart. If you could just take a look at me. Surely you would understand. How I really feel. If I write down everything on this. Just to say that I really like you. Though my chest is beating fast. Though my palms are sweaty now. I'll tell you that I love you. Give me a chance... just one chance is fine. Say my prayers on my own waiting for a sign. Give me a chance... even if unplanned. Come on and look at me turn and look my way. I should get it together I should go and say hello. But saying it is easier and so much harder to do.... Message on a placard from my heart. Wish my hand could go into my mouth. There is a block on my heart... so take it away. You should know that I really like you. If there is some way I could tell you. Even if there's no reply and even if it's hard to try. It would make me happy. Everybody hides away. Those important words to say. Somewhere in a distant place. Way deep down inside their heart. Message on a placard from my heart. If you could just take a look at me. Surely you would understand. How I really feel. If I write down everything on this. Just to say that I really like you. Though my chest is beating fast. Though my palms are sweaty now. I'll tell you that I love you. Message on a placard from my heart. Hey why don't you let it all go out. And tell me what you're thinking. Be honest with me.... If you can't say what you are feeling. it's okay to put it in writing. What you want to show to me. What you want to say to me. Look at me and read my signWaking in the rubble. Walking over glass. Neighbours say we're trouble. Well their time has passed. Peering from the mirror. No, that isn't me. A stranger getting nearer. Who can this person be?. You wouldn't know me at all. Today. From the fading light I'll fly. Rise like a phoenix. Out of the ashes. Seeking rather than vengeance. Retribution. You were warned. Once I'm transformed. Once I'm reborn. You know I will rise like a phoenix. But you're my flame. Go about your business. Act as if you're free. No one could have witnessed. What you did to me. Cause you wouldn't know me today. And you have got to see. To believe. From the fading light I fly. Rise like a phoenix. Out of the ashes. Seeking rather than vengeance. Retribution. You were warned. Once I'm transformed. Once I'm reborn. I rise up to the sky. You threw me down but. I'm gonna fly. And rise like a phoenix. Out of the ashes. Seeking rather than vengeance. Retribution. You were warned. Once I'm transformed. Once I'm reborn. You know I will rise like a phoenix. But you're my flameLa la la la la la la love. Swore I would never be that girl holding your hand. Look at you gazing. Acting like your biggest fan. I used to make fun. Of all the things that they said. Saying I will never be like that. But then you showed up. Like you have been there before. Was like you knew me. Had me with every word. You saw right through me. Melted me down to the core. I was done when you walked through the door. Well, I don't know how you do it to me. You make my brain just stop. Sink my heart to my feet. It's like a roller coaster. But I'm only going up. I'm in crazy stupid love. So call me baby. In front of all your friends. It used to shake me. But would you say it again. It's a weird feeling. We're laying here in the dark. And I don't wanna fight this spark. You got me flying. Don't want to ever come down. I'm realizing. I kinda need you around. Hard to believe it. I'm that girl holding your hand. And I'm still tryna understand. Well, I don't know how you do it to me. You make my brain just stop. Sink my heart to my feet. It's like a roller coaster. But I'm only going up. I'm in crazy stupid love. Whistle, I like it when you blow the whistle. You make me wanna ch!. Bang bang bang bang. Baby I don't own a pistol. My tongue wagging when you wiggle. I'll end up kissing you with or without the mistle. Love the open toes and the clothes. Even though we ain't official. You official, you official. When you see me in a suit. Say I'm so smooth criminal. Playing hard to get. Girl you're being too difficult. Let me in your mind. For I get to the physical. I ain't tryna mess with any woman. That's typical, need original. Lips and eyes, big surprise. If she have hips and thighs. Kissed her twice. Now she say I'm Mr. Right. She had my D. Now she dickmatised. Whoa lord.

La la la la la la la loveIt's Christmas time,. There's no need to be afraid. At Christmas time,. We let in light and we banish shade. And in our world of plenty,. We can spread our smile of joy. Feel your arms around the world at Christmas time. But say a prayer. And pray for the other ones. At christmas time it's hard,. But while your having fun. There's a world outside your window. And it's a world of dread and fear. Where a kiss of love can kill you. Where there's death in every tear. And the Christmas bells that ring there. Are the clanging chimes of doom. Well, tonight we're reaching out and touching you. Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa. A song of hope where there's no hope tonight (ooh). Why is comfort to be feared,. Why is to touch to be scared. How can they know it's Christmas time at all?. Here's to you. Raise a glass to everyone. Here's to them. And all there is to come. Can they know it's Christmas time at all?. Feed the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Feel the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Heal the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Feed the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Feel the world. Let them know it's Christmas time again. Heal the world.
