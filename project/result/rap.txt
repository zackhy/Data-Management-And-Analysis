But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie. Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie. Let's rock, you don't stop. Rock the riddle that will make your body rock. Well, so far youve heard my voice, but I brought two friends along. And next on the mic is my man Hank: come on, Hank, sing that song. Check it out: I'm the C-a-s-an-the-o-v-a, and the rest is f-l-y. Y'see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons, I'll tell ya why:. Y'see I'm six-foot-one and I'm tons of fun, and I dress to a T. Y'see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously. I got bodyguards, I got two big cars that definitely ain't the wack. I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac. So after school, I take a dip in the pool which really is on the wall. I got a color TV, so I can see the Knicks play basketball. Hear me talkin' 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend. But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the rucker, not a dime till I made it again. Y'go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? [(Say what?)]. Y'say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spankin', drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn.

Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows. The beat starts gettin' into your toes. Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet. And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat. And then, damn, ya start doin' the Freak. I said damn, right outta your seat. Then ya throw your hands high in the air. Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere. Ya rockin' to the beat without a care. With the sure shot MCs for the affair. Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang. But I rap to the beat just the same. I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes. All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize. Singin' on n n on n on n on. The beat don't stop until the break of dawn. Singin' on n n on n on on n on. Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie. Pop da pop pop, ya don't dare stop. Come alive, y'all, gimme what ya got. I guess by now, you can take a hunch. And find that I am the baby of the bunch. But that's okay I still keep in stride. 'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind. Singin' on n n on n on n on.

A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme what ya got. 'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock. I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike, what are you waitin' for?. I said-a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie. The hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock. It to the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie. To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat. Skiddlee beebop-a we rock a scoobie doo. And guess what, America, we love you. 'Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul. You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old. I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast. But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast. Rock it up, baby bubbah. Baby bubbah to the boogie, da bang bang da boogie. To the beat beat, it's so unique. Come on, everybody and dance to the beat. I said-a hip hop, the hippie the hippie. To the hip hip hop-a you dont stop. Rock it out, baby bubbah, to the boogie da bang bang. The boogie to the boogie da beat. I said I can't wait till the end of the week. When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat. And attempt to raise your body heat. Just blow your mind so that you can't speak. And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet. And let it change up to a dance called The Freak. And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat. Rest a little while so ya don't get weak. I know a man named Hank. He has more rhymes than a serious bank. So come on, Hank, sing that song. To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong. Well, I'm imp the dimp, the ladies pimp. The women fight for my delight. But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs. That shock the house for the young ladies. And when you come inside into the front. You do the freak, spank, and do the bump. And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point. We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint. A-from sun-to-sun and from day-to-day. I sit down and write a brand new rhyme. Because they say that miracles never cease. I've created a devastating masterpiece. I'm gonna rock the mic till you can't resist. Everybody, I say, it goes like this:. Well, I was comin' home late one dark afternoon. A reporter stopped me for a interview. She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables. That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables. This young reporter, I did adore. So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before. She said, "Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you!. The Cassanova legend must have been true!". I said, "By the way, baby, what's your name?". Said, "I go by the name of Lois Lane. And you could be my boyfiend, you surely can. Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman". I said, "He's a fairy, I do suppose. Flyin' through the air in pantyhose. He may be very sexy or even cute. But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit". I said, "You need a man who's got finesse. And his whole name across his chest. He may be able to fly all through the night. But can he rock a party till the early light?. He can't satisfy you with his little worm. But I can bust you out with my super sperm!". I gon' do it, I gon' do it. I gon' do it, do it, do it. And I'm here, and I'm there. I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere. Just throw your hands up in the air. And party hardy like you just don't care. Let's do it, don't stop y'all. A-tick a-tock, y'all, you don't stop!. Go hotel, motel, what you gonna do today? [(Say what?)]. I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn. You say, if your girl starts actin' up then you take her friend. I say skip, dive, what can I say?. I can't fit em all inside my OJ. So I just take half and bust them out. I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house. It was twelve o'clock one Friday night. I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right. Everybody was dancin' on the floor. Doin' all the things they never did before. And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean. She came into the bar, she came into the scene. As she traveled deeper inside the room. All the fellas checked out her white sasoons. She came up to the table, looked into my eyes. Then she turned around and shook her behind. So I said to myself, "It's time for me to release. My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece". And now, people in the house, this is just for you. A little rap to make you boogaloo. Now the group ya hear is called phase two. And let me tell ya somethin', we're a helluva crew. Once a week we're on the street. Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free. For you to party, ya got to have the moves. So we'll get right down and give you a groove. For you to dance, you gotta get hype. So we'll get right down and make you rock. Now the system's on and the girls are there. Ya definitely have a rockin affair. But let me tell ya somethin', there's still one fact:. That to have a party, ya got to have a rap. So when the party's over, you're makin' it home. And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn. And while ya sleepin', ya start to dream. And thinkin' how ya danced on the disco scene. My name appears in your mind. Yeah, a name you know that was right on time. It was phase two, just a-doin' a do. Rockin' ya down 'cause ya know we could. To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak. Come alive, girls, get on your feet. To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat. To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak. To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on. On n on into the break of dawn. Now I got a man comin' on right now. He's guaranteed to throw down. He goes by the name of Wonder Mike. Come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like. Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey. Like a millionaire that has no money. Like a rainy day that is not wet. Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet. Like Dracula without his fangs. Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang. Like collard greens that don't taste good. Like a tree that's not made out of wood. Like goin' up and not comin' down. Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound. To the beat beat, ya do The Freak. Everybody just rock and dance to the beat. Have you ever went over a friends house to eat. And the food just ain't no good?. I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed. And the chicken tastes like wood. So you try to play it off like you think you can. By sayin that you're full. And then your friend says, "Momma, he's just being polite. He ain't finished, uh uh, that's bull!". So your heart starts pumpin', and you think of a lie. And you say that you already ate. And your friend says, "Man, there's plenty of food!". So you pile some more on your plate. While the stinky foods steamin' your mind starts to dreamin'. Of the moment that it's time to leave. And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin'. Into something that looks like cheese. Oh so, you say, "That's it, I got to leave this place. I don't care what these people think. I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous. With this ugly food that stinks!". So you bust out the door while it's still closed. Still sick from the food you ate. And then you run to the store for quick relief. From a bottle of Kaopectate. And then you call your friend two weeks later. To see how he has been. And he says, "I understand about the food, baby bubbah. But we're still friends". With a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie. The hip hip-a hop-a you don't stop the rockin'. To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie. To the rhythm of the boogie the beat. I say, Hank, can ya rock?. Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?. Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?. I said, come on make the, make the people move. I go to the halls and then ring the bell. Because I am the man with the clientele. And if ya ask me why I rock so well. A big bang, I got clientele. And from the time I was only six years old. I never forgot what I was told. It was the best advice that I ever had. It came from my wise dear old dad. He said, "Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you. And don't say a word until I'm through. Now, there's a time to laugh, a time to cry. A time to live and a time to die. A time to break and a time to chill. To act civilized or act real ill. But whatever ya do in your lifetime. Y'never let a MC steal your rhyme!". So from sixty-six to this very day. I'll always remember what he had to say. So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style. I let them know that I'm versatile. I got style, finesse and a little black book. That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look. But there's a thing that separates you from me. And that is called originality. Because my rhymes are on from what you heard. I didn't even bite and not a Goddamn word. And I say a little more later on tonight. So the sucker MCs can bite all night. A-tick a-tock y'all, a-beat beat y'all. A-let's rock y'all, ya don't stop. Ya go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? [(Say what?)]. Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spankin'. Drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn. Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends. A-like that y'all, to the beat y'all. Beat beat ya'll, ya don't stop. A-Master Gee, am I mellow?. It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?. Well, like Johnny Carson on The Late Show. A-like Frankie Crocker in stereo. Well, like The Bar-Kay's singin' Holy Ghost. The sounds to throw down, they're played the most. It's like my man, Captain Sky. Whose name he earned with his super sperm. We rock and we don't stop. Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got. To the beat that it makes you freak. And come alive, girl, get on your feet. A-like a Perry Mason without a case. Like Farrah Fawcett without her face. Like The Bar-Kays on the mic. Like gettin' right down for you tonight. Like movin' your body so ya don't know how. Right to the rhythm and throw down. Like comin' alive to the Master Gee. The brother who rocks so viciously. I said, the age of one, my life begun. At the age of two, I was doin the' do. At the age of three, it was you and me.

(Good, good, well, it's good, good, good). Solid. (Solid, solid, solid, solid, solid). As a rockWhen I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall. And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call. Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove. For the first time in my life, I see I need love. There I was giggling about the games. That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names. Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn. 'Coz I said to myself look what you've done to her. I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels. All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal. Playing make believe pretending that I'm true. Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you. Saying amor, kissing you on the ear. Whispering I love you and I'll always be here. Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found. A desire for true love floating around. Inside my soul because my soul is cold. And half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old. But the other half needs affection and joy. And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy. I need love. I need love. Romance sheer delight how sweet. I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete. You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle. I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle. I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat. Kiss you on the cheek and say ooo girl you're so sweet. It's deja vu whenever I'm with you. I could go on forever telling you what I do. But where you at you're neither here or there. I swear I can't find you anywhere. Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug. This love search is really making me bug. And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen. Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean. Fantasy's can run but they can't hide. And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside. I need love. I need love. I wanna kiss you, hold you never scold you just love you. Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you. Grind moan and never be alone. If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone. Can't you hear it in my voice, I need love bad. I've got money but love's something I've never had. I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all. I love you more than a man who's ten feet tall. I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes. We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed. Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal. You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel. It's like a dream land, I can't lie I never been there. Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share. Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet. I swear to you this is something I'll never forget. I need love. I need love. See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer. A play boy on the run I need something that's stronger. Friendship, trust honor respect admiration. This whole experience has been such a revelation. It's taught me love and how to be a real man. To always be considerate and do all I can. Protect you you're my lady and you mean so much. My body tingles all over from the slightest touch of your hand. And understand I'll be frozen in time. Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine. If I find you girl I swear I'll be a good man. I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands. I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive. I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive. I'll search the whole world for that special girl. When I finally find you watch our love unfurl. I need love. I need love. Girl, listen to me. When I be sittin' in my room all alone, staring at the wall. Fantasies, they go through my mind. And I've come to realize that I need true love. And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen. I'll be waiting, I love youThe Escape Club. Miscellaneous. Wild Wild West. Wild Wild West. Escape Club.

With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet. Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed?. At the boys from home, they all came running. They were making noise, manhandling toys. That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls. Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws. Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?. Gigolo, huh, sukka?. Gigolo, gigolo, huh, sukka?. Who's looking good today?. Who's looking good in every way?. No style rookie. You better watch don't mess with me. No money man can win my love.

So don't you get fresh with me. Get funky, yeah, Timmy. Tell it like it is, check out this DJ. So you say, you wanted money. But you know it's never funny. When your shoes worn through. And there's a rumble in your tummy. But you had to have style, get a gold tooth smile. Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile. Committed a crime and went inside. It was coming your way but you had to survive. When you lost your babe, you lost the race. Now you're looking at me to take her place. Who's looking good today?. Who's looking good in every way?. No style rookie. You better watch don't mess with me. Smokin' not cokin' get funky sax. Looking good, hanging with the wild bunch. Looking good in a Buffalo Stance.

But you’re standin’ on the wall like you was Poindexter.. Next day’s function, high class luncheon,. Food is served and you’re stone cold munchin’.. Music comes on, people start to dance.

So come on, fatso, and just bust a move.. (vocal scatting). Just bust a move!. You’re on a mission and you’re wishin’. Someone could cure your lonely condition.. Lookin’ for love in all the wrong places,. No fine girls, just ugly faces.. From frustration, first inclination. Is to become a monk and leave the situation.. But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope,. So don’t hang yourself with a celibate rope.. New movie’s showin’, so you’re goin’. Could care less about the five you’re blowin’. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. Then you spot a fine woman sittin’ in your row. She’s dressed in yellow, she says “Hello,. Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!”. You run over there without a second to lose,. And what comes next? Hey, bust a move!. If you want it, you got it.. If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move!). If you want it, you got it.. If you want it, baby, you got it.. In the city, ladies look pretty.. Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty.. Tell a funny joke just to get some play,. Then you try to make a move and she says, “no way.”. Girls are fakin’, goodness sakin’,. They want a man who brings home the bacon.. Got no money and you got no car,. Then you got no woman and there you are.. Some girls are sophistic, materialistic,. Looking for a man makes them opportunistic.. They’re lyin’ on the beach perpetratin’ a tan. So that a brother with money can be their man.. So on the beach you’re strollin’, real high-rollin’,. Everything you have is yours and not stolen.. A girl runs up with somethin’ to prove,. So don’t just stand there, bust a move!. If you want it, you got it.. If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move). If you want it, you got it. If you want it, baby, you got it.

He’s hopin’ you can make it there if you can,. ‘Cause in the ceremony you’ll be the best man.. You say neato, check your libido,. And roll to the church in your new tuxedo.. The bride walks down just to start the wedding,. And there’s one more girl you won’t be getting.. So you start thinkin’, then you start blinkin’.. A bride maid looks and thinks that you’re winkin’.. She thinks you’re kinda cute so she winks back,. And now you’re feelin really fine ’cause the girl is stacked.. Reception’s jumpin’, bass is pumpin’,.

Your girlfriend is on another date with the hero in your dream. Turn around, ask yourself. So, you think you're gonna win this time Manchild?. Is it the pain of the drinking. Or the Sunday sinking feeling. The car never seems to work. When it's late your girlfriend's on a date. And the hero with her in your dream. In your sleep it seemed to like you. Turn around and ask yourself. Turn around ask yourself. Manchild, will you ever win?. Manchild, look at the state you're in. Could you go undercover. And sell your brand new lover. Could you be someone else for a night?. Maybe someone else will love you. You sell your soul for a tacky song. Like the one you hear on the radio. Turn around ask yourself. Turn around and ask yourself. Manchild, will you ever win. Manchild, look at the state you're in. Manchild, he will make you cry. Manchild, Manchild, Manchild. From Monday down to Friday. You're working on another man's car. Or is it in the factory?. It doesn't matter where you are. Just turn around and ask yourself is this communication. Accentuate the positive and give some illustration. See Manchild, you're no one, you turn the microphone on. Control communication when I'm kickin' it and so on. To the point that I need, the air that I breathe. Into an audience that's waiting and ecstatic to receive. For the meantime another mean rhyme, I keep on sayin' it. I know what the time is the crowd will keep playing it. Through the speaker boxes loud's my diagnosis. 'Cause I believe in miracles and words in heavy doses. Enough R E S P E and C T. Respect yourself express no stress the mike is easy. Just believe that all you need is the air that you breathe. Turn around ask yourself. Manchild, will you ever win?. Manchild, look at the state you're in. Manchild, he will make you cry. Manchild, Manchild, Manchild. He's the apple of your eye. Once bitten twice shy, why don't you bite me again. Just take it in the right and go tell your friend. Are you ready for the words I turn the microphone on. A figure of speech to reach you at the back and so on. The style I'm stimulating dance floors. Raise your body temperature now and. This demands for power in the amp you know lauds my diagnosis. 'Cause I believe in miracles and words in heavy dosesYo, VIP, Let's kick it! . . Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Baby . All right stop, Collaborate and listen . Ice is back with my brand new invention . Something grabs a hold of me tightly . Then I flow like a harpoon daily and nightly . Will it ever stop? Yo -- I don't know . Turn off the lights and I'll glow . To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal . Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle. . . Dance, Bum rush the speaker that booms . I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom . Deadly, when I play a dope melody . Anything less than the best is a felony . Love it or leave it, You better gain way . You better hit bull's eye, The kid don't play . If there was a problem, Yo, I'll solve it . Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it . . Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla . Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla . . Now that the party is jumping . With the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin' . Quick to the point, to the point no faking . I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon . Burning them if they're not quick and nimble . I go crazy when I hear a cymbal . And a hi hat with a souped up tempo . I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo . Rollin' in my 5.0 . With my ragtop down so my hair can blow . The girlies on standby, Waving just to say Hi . Did you stop? No -- I just drove by . Kept on pursuing to the next stop . I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block . That block was dead . . Yo -- so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave. . Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis . Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis . Jealous 'cause I'm out geting mine . Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine . Reading for the chumps on the wall . The chumps acting ill because they're so full of "Eight Ball" . Gunshots ranged out like a bell . I grabbed my nine -- All I heard were shells . Falling on the concrete real fast . Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas . Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed . I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack . Police on the scene, You know what I mean . They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends . If there was a problem, You, I'll solve it . Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it . . Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla . Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla . . Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet . Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it . My town, that created all the bass sound . Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground . 'Cause my style's like a chemical spill . Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel . Conducted and formed, This is a hell of a concept . We make it hype and you want to step with this . Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja . Cut like a razor blade so fast, Other DJs say, "damn" . If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram . Keep my composure when it's time to get loose . Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice . If there was a problem, Yo -- I'll solve it! . Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it. . . Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla .

'cause I'm about to ruin. the image and the style that ya used to.. I look funny,. but yo I'm makin' money, see. so yo world I hope you're ready for me.. Now gather round. I'm the new fool in town. and my sound's laid down by the Underground.. I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf. so just let me introduce myself. My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty.. Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee.. And all the rappers in the top ten-please allow me to bump thee.. I'm steppin' tall, y'all,. and just like Humpty Dumpty. you're gonna fall when the stereos pump me.. I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky,. I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy.. I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack. but sometimes I get ridiculous. I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice. hey yo fat girl, c'mere-are ya ticklish?. Yeah, I called ya fat.. Look at me, I'm skinny. It never stopped me from gettin' busy. I'm a freak. I like the girls with the boom. I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom. I'm crazy.. Allow me to amaze thee.. They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me.. I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants. and I even got my own dance. The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump. Do the Humpty Hump,. come on and do the Humpty Hump. Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump. Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump. Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump. People say "Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'". that's all right 'cause I get things cookin'. Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me. but ya can't get near me. I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B,. all the girls they adore me. Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere. 'cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear.. My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed. Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid. I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge,. both how I'm livin' and my nose is large. I get stoopid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid,. I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid. I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it,. I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits. Also told ya that I like to bite. Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write.. All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance. and now I'm gonna do my dance.. Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all. Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here. Now that I told ya a little bit about myself. let me tell ya a little bit about this dance. It's real easy to do--check it out. First I limp to the side like my leg was broken. Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'. Crazy wack funky. People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty. That's all right 'cause my body's in motion. It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion. Anyone can play this game. This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name. No two people will do it the same. Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain. Humpin', funkin', jumpin',. jig around, shakin' ya rump,. and when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump. tell him step off, I'm doin' the Hump.. Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump. White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump. Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doin' the hump. Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump. Once again, the Underground is in the house.

Verse One: Fresh Prince. Here it is the groove slightly transformed. just a bit of a break from the norm. just a little somethin' to break the monotony. of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be. a little bit out of control it's cool to dance. but what about the groove that soothes that moves romance. give me a soft subtle mix. and if ain't broke then don't try to fix it. and think of the summers of the past. adjust the base and let the alpine blast. pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme. and put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime. Chorus. Verse Two: Fresh Prince. school is out and it's a sort of a buzz. but back then I didn't really know what it was. but now I see what have of this. the way that people respond to summer madness. the weather is hot and girls are dressing less. and checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best. ridin around in your jeep or your benzos. or in your nissan stting on lorenzos. back in Philly we be ou in the park. a place called the plateau is where everybody go. guys out hunting and girls doing likewise. honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes. she turn around to see what you beeping at. it's like the summers a natural afrodesiac. and with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme. to hit you and get you equipped for the summer time. Chorus. Verse Three: Fresh Prince. it's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet. hustle to the mall to get me a short set. yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair. cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there. the temperature's about 88. hop in the water plug just for old times sake. break to ya crib change your clothes once more. cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4. sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise. about the days growing up and the first person you kissed. and as I think back makes me wonder how. the smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia. all the kids playing out front. little boys messin round with the girls playing double-dutch. while the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion. then six o'clock rolls around. you just finished wiping your car down. it's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout. it looks like a car show. everybody come lookin real fine. fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon. every moment frontin and maxin. chillin in the car they spent all day waxin. leanin to the side but you can't speed through. two miles an hour so everybody sees you. there's an air of love and of happiness. and this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion of summer madness. ChorusArmy with harmony. Dave drop a load on 'em. OPP how can I explain it. I'll take you frame by frame it. To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it. O is for other P is for people scratchin' temple. The last P, well, that's not that simple. It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten. It's five little letters that are missin' here. You get on occassion at the other party. As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'. Bust it. You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello. You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow. You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about. Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house. It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T. It's just her boyfriend's at her house. (Boy, that's what is scary). It's OPP, time other people's what you get it. There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it. How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at. Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at. Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it. But if you don't, here's your membership. You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (Every last homie). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (All the homies). As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted. The first two letters are the same. But the last is something different. It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest. It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest. I won't get into that, I'll do it, ah, sorta properly. I say the last P hmm stands for property. Now lady here comes a kiss. Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly. Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife?. And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice?. You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away. That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway?. You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care. 'Cos in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there. When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know. And then y'all could throw the skeleton bone right in the closet door. Now don't be shocked 'cos if you're down I want your hands up high. Say "OPP," "OPP!" I like to say with pride. Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts. You're now down with a discount. You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (Every last lady). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (All the ladies). This girl ah tried to OPP me. I had a girl and she knew that matter of fact. My girl was partner's that had a fall out. Disagreement, yeah an argument. She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it. That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling. 'Cos after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings. I said, "Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave". She said, "Oh no, I love you Treach" I said, "Now child please". You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go. I said, "Now look you to the stairs and to the stairwindow. This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart. 'Cos you know I was OPP, hell from the very start". Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about. When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth. That's rule number one in this OPP establishment. You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him. Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business. Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with. Him or her for sure is going to admit it. When OPP comes, damn, skippy I'm with it. You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (This whole party). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (This whole party). Break it downPlay that funky music. Play that funky music, white boy. Play that funky music. Play that funky music, white boy. I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell. A rockin' on the mic while the fly girls yell. In ecstasy in the back of me. Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them z's. Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy. Vanilla's on the mic, man I'm not lazy. I'm lettin' my drug kick in. It controls my mouth and I begin. To just let it flow, let my concepts go. My posse's to the side yellin', "Go Vanilla go". Smooth 'cause that's the way I will be. And if you don't give a damn, then. Why you starin' at me. So get off 'cause I control the stage. There's no dissin' allowed. I'm in my own phase. The girlies say they love me and that is okay. And I can dance better than any kid n' play. Play that funky music, come on, come on. Play that funky music, white boy.   (I can't hear you, say it, say it ,say). Play that funky music. Play that funky music, white boy it, come on.   (Yeah, a little bit louder).   (Now come on, come on). Stage 2, yeah the one ya' wanna listen to. It's off my head so let the beat play through. So I can funk it up and make it sound good. 1-2-3 yo, knock on some wood. For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious. Super calafragilistic expialidocious. I'm an effect and that you can bet. I can take a fly girl and make her wet. I'm like Samson, Samson to Delilah.

Jump, jump, jumpNALord, I've really been real stressed, down and out, losing ground.. Although I am black and proud, problems got me pessimistic.. Brothers and sisters keep messin' up, why does it have to be so damn tuff?. I don't know where I can go to let these ghosts out of my skull.. My grandma past my brother's gone, I never at once felt so alone.. I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel, not just my spare tire.. (Home!) But Lord, I ask you,. (Home!) to be my guiding force and truth.. (Home!) For some strange reason it had to be,. (Home!) he guided me to Tennessee.. (Home!) Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Lord it's obvious we got a relationship. Talkin' to each other every night and day. Although you're superior over me. We talk to each other in a friendship way. Then outta nowhere you tell me to break. Outta the country and into more country. Past Dyesburg and Ripley. Where the ghost of childhood haunts me. Walk the roads my forefathers walked. Climb the trees my forefathers hung from. Ask those trees for all their wisdom. They tell me my ears are so young. (Home). Go back, from whence you came (Home). My family tree, my family name (Home). For some strange reason it had to be (Home). He guided me to Tennessee. (Home). (Home!) Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Now I see the importance of history. Why my people be in the mess that they be. Many journeys to freedom made in vain. By brothers on the corner playin' ghetto games. I ask you, Lord why you enlightened me. Without the enlightenment of all my folks. He said, cuz I set myself on a quest for truth. And he was there to quench my thirst. But I am still thirsty. The Lord allowed me to drink some more. He said what I am searching for are. The answers to all which are in front of me. The ultimate truth started to get blurry. For some strange reason it had to be. It was all a dream about Tennessee. (Home!) Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Oh, won't you let me, won't you help me,. won't you help me understand your plan.. Take me home, take me home, home, take me to another place.. Take me home, take me home, home, take me to another place.Hey. Alright. Hey. Come on. .

Know that if you do, beautiful Heaven awaits. That's the poem I wrote for the first time. I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate. Mr. Wendal, that's his name. No one ever knew his name 'cuz he's a no one. Never thought twice about spending on an old bum. Until I had the chance to really get to know one. Now that I know 'em, to give him money isn't charity. He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes. And to think blacks spend all their money on big colleges. Still most of you come out confused. Go ahead Mr. Wendal. Go ahead Mr. Wendal. Mr. Wendal has freedom. A free that you and I think he's dumb. Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society. For Mr. Wendal's a bum. His only worries are sickness and occasional harassment. By the police and their chase. Uncivilized we call him but I just saw him. Eat off the food we waste. Civilization, are we really civilized?. Yes or no, who are we to judge. When thousands of innocent man could be brutally enslaved. And killed over a racist grudge. Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways. But we don't hear him talk. It's not his fault when we're goin' too far and we got too far. 'Cuz on him we walk. Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh but not by law. I feed you dignity to stand with pride. Realize now that all in all we stand tall. Go ahead Mr. Wendal. Mr. Wendal. Mr. Wendal. Mr. WendalWhen the time grew near, for me to show my love. The longer I stayed away for, hidin' from a word. I need to hear now, don't think I'll hear it again. But the nights were always warm with you. Holding you right by my side. But the mornin' always comes too soon. Before I even close my eyes. All I do each night is pray. Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday. All I do each night is think, of all the times. I close the door to keep my love within. If you can't forgive the past, I'll understand that. Can't understand why I did this to you. And all of the days and the nights, oh I'll regret it. I never showed you my love. But the nights were always warm with you. Holding you right by my side. But the mornin' always comes too soon. Before I even close my eyes. All I do each night is pray. Hopin' that, I'll be a part of you again someday. All I do each night is think, of all the times. I close the door to keep my love within. Surely we must be in sight, of the dream we long to live. If you stop and close your eyes, you'll picture me inside. I'm so cold and all alone. Straight on back to me. All I do each night is pray. Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday. All I do each night is think, of all the times. I close the door to keep my love within. All I do each night is pray. Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again someday. All I do each night is think, of all the times. I close the door to keep my love within. All I do each night is pray. Hopin' that I'll be a part of you again somedayBreak 'em off. Shit. Yo, yo, uhh. . Just wakin' up in the mornin' gotta thank God. I don't know but today seems kinda odd. No barkin' from the dog, no smog. And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog. (Damn). I got my grub on, but didn't pig out. Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out. (Whassup?). Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'. Thinkin' will I live another twenty-fo'. I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top. . And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop. Had to stop, at a red light. Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight. And everything is alright. I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night. Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all. Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?. Get me on the court and I'm trouble. Last week fucked around and got a triple double. Freakin' niggaz everyway like M.J. I can't believe, today was a good day. (Shit!). . Drove to the pad and hit the showers. Didn't even get no static from the cowards. 'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me. Saw the police and they rolled right past me. No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction. As I ran the intersection. Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' yo! MTV Raps. What's the haps on the craps?. . Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em. Roll 'em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break 'em. With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven. Seven even back do' Lil' Joe. I picked up the cash flow. Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' domino. Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A. Today was a good day. (Shit!). . Left my nigga's house paid. (What). Picked up a girl been tryin' to fuck since the 12th grade. It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic. The lakers beat the Supersonics. I felt on the big fat fanny. Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny. And my dick runs deep, so deep. So deep put her ass to sleep. Woke her up around one. She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun. Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'. Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion. . I was glad everything had worked out. Dropped her ass off and then chirped out. Today was like one of those fly dreams. Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams. No helicopter looking for a murder. Two in the mornin' got the Fatburger. Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp. And it read, "Ice Cube's a pimp". (Yeah). Drunk as hell but no throwin' up. Half way home and my pager still blowin' up. Today I didn't even have to use my A.K. I got to say it was a good day. (Shit!). . Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh, stop this shit. What the fuck I'm thinkin' about?Give it up for Naughty By Nature. Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho. You drew a picture of my morning. But you couldn't make my day (hey!). I'm rocking and you're yawning. But you never look my way (hey!). I'm licking down you darling. In every single way (hey!). Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way. This ain't got shit to do with shampoo. But watch your Head 'n Shoulders. Brother older bold enough to fold ya. Yo, I told ya. A raid afraid of what I made. and played em plus a funky fit. So save ya flips and tricks. Put that music in the monkey bit. Triggas from the Grill town Ill town. Some ask how it feels now. The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round. Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom. Ain't tryin' to be handsome. Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'. I live and die for Hip Hop. This is Hip Hop of today. I give props to Hip Hop. So Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho. Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho. You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground. Being lowdown. I do the showdown with any little ho' 'round (NO!). I wanna know who you're believing. Through your funny reasons. Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheating. You said I know you're mister O.P.P man. You P.P man. Won't only see me man. You should've know that I ain't hitting the step. That I was with it a bit. Not to consider the rep (Heck!). I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker. Cause I'm Naughty By Nature. Not cause I hate ya. You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart. And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark. You try to act like something really big is missing. Even though my name's graffiti written on your kitten. I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way. Let's start a family today. Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho. Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho. Hip Hop, Hip, Hip Hop, Hip, Hip Hop Hooray. There's many hungry Hip Hoppers. One reason Hip Hop's the top today. Swerve what you heard. Cause I ain't baling no hay. Ain't chopping no crop. But still growing every day. Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found. From the underground town down the hill. Feel how Ill town. Drown smiles to frowns. Snatchin' crowns from clowns. Beat downs are found. Don't know me! Don't come around!. Tippy tippy pause. Tippy tippy pause. Some start creepin' up, I eat 'em up. Their styles are older than Lou Rawls. Peace to this one and that one and them. That's the way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend. Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us. You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us. Some kitty's purr. Now call me sir too. Lookin' for her crew. Any trick that diss gets a curfew. I put on projects for boots. Step through troops and leave proof. My problem solver name is Mook. I'm hittin' woodies in a hoody. Peace to Jesette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Jenae and every hood Gee. That's right, my fight is ill. Peace goes to L.O.N.S & Quest, Nice & Smooth and Cypress Hill. I live and die for Hip Hop. This is Hip Hop of today. I give props to Hip Hop. So Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho.

Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume. some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk. just rollin in my ride, chillin all alone. Just hit the Eastside of the LBC. on a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.. Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak. all you skirts know what's up with 213. So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis. some brothas shootin dice so I said "Let's do this". I jumped out the ride, and said "What's up?". some brothas pulled some gats so I said "I'm stuck.". Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve. these hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb. Won'tcha think of better things than some horny tricks. I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix. I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself. I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth. they took my rings, they took my rolex. I looked at the brotha said "Damn, what's next?". They got my homey hemmed up and they all around. ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound. I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown. I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down. They got guns to my head. I think I'm going down. I can't believe this happenin in my own town. If I had wings I would fly. let me contemplate. I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate. Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole. Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold. now they droppin and yellin. it's a tad bit late. Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate. I laid all them busters down. I let my gat explode. now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode. if you want skirts sit back and observe. I just left a gang of those over there on the curb. Now Nate got the freaks. and that's a known fact. before I got jacked I was on the same track. back up back up cause it's on. N A T E and me. the Warren to the G. Just like I thought. they were in the same spot. in need of some desperate help. the Nate Dogg and the G-child. were in need of something else. one of them dames was sexy as hell. I said "ooo I like your size.". she said "my car's broke down and you seem real nice. would ya let me ride?". I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell. the next stop is the Eastside Motel. I'm tweaking. into a whole new era. G-Funk. step to this. I dare ya. Funk. on a whole new level. the rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble. Chords. Strings. We brings. Melody. G-Funk. where rhythm is life. and life is rhythm. If you know like I know. you don't wanna step to this. It's the G-Funk era. funked out with a gangsta twist. if you smoke like I smoke. then you high like everyday. and if your ass is a buster. 213 will regulateNACome on, y'all, let's take a ride. Don't you say shit, just get inside. It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip. 'Cause you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip. Grab your gat with the extra clip.

Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face. Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place. Suspended from school, scared to go home. I was a fool with the big boys, breakin' all the rules. Shed tears with my baby sister. Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids. And even though we had different daddies. The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama. I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell. Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell. And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary. One day, runnin' from the police that's right. Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside. And even as a crack fiend mama. You always was a black queen mama. I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man. You always was committed, a poor single mother on welfare. Tell me how you did it, there's no way I can pay you back. But the plan is to show you that I understand.. You are appreciated.. Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama). Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated). Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.. Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair. No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there. He passed away and I didn't cry. 'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger. They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless. But all along I was lookin' for a father, he was gone. I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs. They showed a young brother love. I moved out and started really hangin'. I needed money of my own so I started slangin'. I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks. It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox. I love payin' rent when the rent's due. I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you. 'Cause when I was low you was there for me. You never left me alone because you cared for me. And I can see you comin' home after work, late. Your in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate. Just workin' with the scraps you was given. And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving. But now the road got rough, your alone. Tryin' to raise 2 bad kids on your own. And there's no way I can pay you back. But my plan is to show you that I understand.. You are appreciated.. Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (And dear Mama). Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated). Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.. Pour out some liquor and I reminisce. 'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama. And when it seems that I'm hopeless. You say the words that can get me back in focus. When I was sick as a little kid. To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did. And all my childhood memories. Are full of all the sweet things you did for me. And even though I act crazy. I got to thank the Lord that you made me. There are no words that can express how I feel. You never kept a secret, always stayed real. And I appreciate how you raised me. And all the extra love that you gave me. I wish I could take the pain away. If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day. Everything will be alright if you hold on. It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on. And there's no way I can pay you back. But my plan is to show you that I understand.. You are appreciated.. Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama). Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated). Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama). Sweet lady, lady, lady, lady.[Featuring: Dr. Dre]. . California love!. . [1:]. California... knows how to party.

Make some more G's, funk. Ya don't need. Approachin' women with a passion, been a long day. But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way. Your body is bangin', baby, I love the way you flaunt it. Time to give it to daddy, sugar, now tell me how you want it. Tell me, baby. Is it cool to touch?. Tell a man that you can trust.

Hit you with the hot tracks. Want some on lease?. I'm makin' millions, tryin' to top that. They wanna censor me. They'd rather see me in a cell. Just live in hell. Only a few of us'll live to tell. Heh heh. Now everybody talkin' bout us, I ain't givin' up. The very one that taught us all to cuss. Come on, tell me how you want it. I was raised as a youth. Tell the truth, I got the scoop. On how to get a bulletproof. Suckers bustin' off the roof. And when I was a teenager. Mobile phone, SkyPager. Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries. Is gettin' worried. They paranoid of gettin' buried. One of us gon' see the cemetary. They wonder if my lifestyle's changed. And am I through with all the pain. Survivin' in this game. And still the same. Honey, just meet me at the strip club, bring a thong. Look how they shakin' for that cash. Once again, it's on. I have no sympathy for those who afraid of mystery. Come get with me, I promise passion and ecstacy. I'm alone, can I come over. There tonight?. Depend on me, the one to handle it and get it right. - to fadeI've been watchin' you from afar. For as long as I can remember. You are all a real man can need. And ever ask for, this is love. This is more than a crush. It was all up at Rutgers, I saw with your man. Smiling, a coach bag in your hand. I was layin' in the coup with my hat turned back. We caught eyes for a moment and that was that. So skated off as you strolled off. Looking at them legs, god damn they looked so soft. I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission. If his love is real he got ta handle competition. You only knew about 5 months. Besides he drinks too much and smokes too many blunts. And I've been workin' out everyday thinkin' 'bout you. Lookin' at my own eyes in the rear view. Catchin' flash backs of our eye contact. Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back. I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears. I can't believe it, I had a crush in years. Hey lover. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday. Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way. And I don't want ta violate your relationship. So I lay back in the cut with a crush that'a trip. Still he can't stop me from having day dreams. Tonging you down with  vanilla ice cream. Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight. Searching your body with my tounge girl all night. I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams can turn into reality. Our love would come down so naturally. We would walk down the isle of destiny. What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared. Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair. That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs. But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead. Hey lover. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Last week I saw ya at the mall. Standing at the pay phone 'bout to make a call. I had a vision, it was me on the other end. Telling you come by and then you walked in. I touched you gently with my hands. We talked about travellin' the distant lands. Escaping all the madness out here in the world. Becomin' my wife no longer my girl. Then you let your dress fall down to the floor. I kissed you softly and you yearned for more. We experienced pleasure unparallel. Into a ocean of love we both fell. Swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss. Fantasies interchanging with each kiss. Undying passion unites our souls. Together we swim until the point of no control. But its a fantasy, you won't come true. We never even spoke and your man still love you. So I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside. Keep my dreams alive until the right time. Hey, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. This is more than a crush. This is more than a crush. This is more than a crush.

If you ain't peek then you must be drinking and smokin'. Pretending not to lookin' but you're brokin' let me get you open. Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life. And Tamika around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe. The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money. And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny. But who's the dummy 'cos, now you done lost the hustler. A down-ass brother got replaced by a buster. And though I got love for ya I know I can't trust ya. 'Cos my crew is rollin' hummers and your crew is rollin' dust's. And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more. I guess that's just the way it goes I ain't trying preach. I believe I can reach but your mind ain't prepared. I'll see you when you get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. More temptation and faith I guess we livin' for the day. I seen a man get swept off his feet by a boy with an AK. The situation so twisted everybody getting lifted. I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business. 'Cos it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention. So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin'. Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big horse. Someone's gotta run a little faster 'cos we gotta lay the struggle. I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender. And if everybody's a sinner then everybody could be a winner. No matter you rag collar deep down we all brothers. And regardless of the time somebody up there still love us. I'm a scuff and struggle and y'all I'm breathless and weak. I just strive my whole life to make it to the mountain peak. Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something. I'll be there when you get there when you wit the sound bumpin'. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. You need to loosen up and live a little. And if you got kids let them know how you feelin'. For your own sake give a little. Oh, you don't want to hear that you busy trying stack. And keep them from the Jones's is taking advantage of your own. The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest. But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone. Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us. We prefer to keep our eyes shut to describe when. It's something wrong and we desire. So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous. I know time seems right and the problems seem endless. But at times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together. And if you fell you're out the game then you need to get back in it. 'Cos nothing worse than a quitter. You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother. So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition. And put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. As we walk down the road of our destiny. And the time comes to choose which shall it be. The wide and crooked, or the straight barrel. We got one voice to give and one life to live. Stand up for something or lie down in your game. Listen to the song that we sing. It's up to you to make it big. I guess I'll see you when you see me. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there[Chorus:]. I shot the sheriff*. [Repeat Chorus:]. [Verse 1:]. I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable. He mistaked me for somebody who was liable. For all tha many murders l.a and war fields. We keep makin war shields. Streets keep souls. Young brothers loose control. I seem to maintain through this. Watch where ya kick it they'll put you in a twist. And it aint nobody like my down ass hommie. And tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me. I keep away from fools . They do crime and it attracts cops. Cops got guns and cuffs. And cells to stuff you in. [Repeat Chorus:]. [Verse 2:]. They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do. You know who. The boys in blue. There they go with they assumpitons. Slaverys over let us have somethin'. Why you wanna pull me over?. Cuz I'm bumpin?. I just made a new song. My profession is music. Your profession is protection with gats. Then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away. I'm just tryin' to live my life today. So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops. Cops got guns and cuffs. And cells to stuff you in. [Repeat Chorus:]. [Verse 3:]. I shot the sheriff. I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to. Cuz in this game they always tryin' to blast you. And leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder.

(The Wild Wild West)Come on, come on. I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself. Is life worth living, should I blast myself?. I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black. My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch. Cops give a damn about a negro. Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero. Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares. One less hungry mouth on the welfare. First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers. Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other. It's time to fight back that's what Huey said. Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead. I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere. Unless we share with each other. We gotta start makin' changes. Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers. And that's how it's supposed to be. How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?. I'd love to go back to when we played as kids. But things changed, that's the way it is. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. I see no changes, all I see is racist faces. Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races. We under, I wonder what it takes to make this. One better place, let's erase the wasted. Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right. 'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight. And only time we chill is when we kill each other. It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other. And although it seems heaven sent. We ain't ready, to see a black President. It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact. The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks. But some things will never change. Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game. Now tell me, what's a mother to do?. Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you. You gotta operate the easy way. I made a G today, but you made it in a sleazy way. Sellin' crack to the kid, I gotta get paid. Well hey, well, that's the way it is. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. We gotta make a change. It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes. Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live. And let's change the way we treat each other. You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do. What we gotta do, to survivem. And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?. There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East. Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs. So the police can bother me. And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do. But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you. Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up. Crack you up and pimps smack you up. You gotta learn to hold ya own. They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone. But tell the cops, they can't touch this. I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this. That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool?. My mama didn't raise no fool. And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped. And I never get to lay back. 'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs. Some buck that I roughed up way back. Comin' back after all these years. Rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, that's the way it is. That's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. That's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. Some things will never changeHi, my name is, my name is. (What? Who?). My name is Slim Shady. Hi, my name is, my name is. (Huh? What?). My name is Slim Shady. Ahem, excuse me. Can I have the attention of the class. For one second?. Hi kids, do you like violence?. (Yeah, yeah, yeah). Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails. Through each one of my eyelids?. (Uh, huh). Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?. (Yeah, yeah). Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?. (Huh?). My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight. But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate. (Umm). And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead". Uh, uhh, So why's your face red?  Man you wasted. Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else. 'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt. Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off. And smacked her so hard. I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross. I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass. Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast. C'mere slut. (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog). I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off. Hi, my name is, my name is. (What? Who?). My name is Slim Shady. Hi, my name is, my name is. (Huh? What?). My name is Slim Shady. My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high. Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five. I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler. And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers. (Oww). Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up. Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup. Extraterrestrial, runnin' over pedestrians. In a spaceship while they screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends". Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to. I just found out my mom does more dope than I do. (Damn). I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper. Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her. (Oh, thank you). You know you blew up when the women rush your stands. And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans. (Aah). This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph. (Dude, can I get your autograph?). So I signed it "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole". Hi, my name is, my name is. (What? Who?). My name is Slim Shady. Hi, my name is, my name is. (Huh? What?). My name is Slim Shady. Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away. (Get him). Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate. I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die. (Fuck that). I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive. (Huh, yup). Am I comin' or goin'?  I can barely decide. I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?. (Go ahead). All my life I was very deprived. I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide. Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk. (Hachhh-too). I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks. (C'mere). When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits. How you gonna breast feed me, mom?. (Wah). You ain't got no tits. (Wah). I lay awake and strap myself in the bed. Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head. I'm steamin' mad. And by the way when you see my dad?. (Yeah?). Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had. Hi, my name is, my name is. (What? Who?). My name is Slim Shady. Hi, my name is, my name is. (Huh? What?). My name is Slim ShadyYeah Yeah Yeah Yeah. Miami, uh, uh. Southbeach, bringin the heat, uh. Haha, can y'all feel that. Can y'all feel that. Jig it out, uh.

Here it comes, another year. Everyone, new millennium. There's a party tonight, everybody was drinkin'. The house was screamin' and the bass was shakin'.

Everybody say, what now. Say what now, saw what now. Come on, come on, come onMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?. Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad. It's not so bad. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?. Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad. It's not so bad. Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'. I left my cell, my pager. And my home phone at the bottom. I sent two letters back in autumn. You must not have got 'em. It probably was a problem. At the post office or somethin'. Sometimes I scribble addresses. Too sloppy when I jot 'em. But anyways fuck it. What's been up man, how's your daughter?. My girlfriend's pregnant too. I'm out to be a father. If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?. I'm a name her Bonnie. I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry. I had a friend kill himself over some bitch. Who didn't want him. I know you probably hear this everyday. But I'm your biggest fan. I even got the underground shit that you did with scam. I got a room full of your posters. And your pictures man. I like the shit you did with Ruckus too. That shit was fat. Anyways I hope you get this, man. Hit me back just to chat. Truly yours, your biggest fan. This is Stan. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?. Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad. It's not so bad. Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote. I hope you have the chance, I ain't mad. I just think it's fucked up, you don't answer fans. If you didn't want to talk to me. Outside the concert you didn't have to. But you could've signed an autograph for Matthew. That's my little brother man. He's only 6 years old. We waited in the blistering cold for you. For 4 hours and you just said "No". That's pretty shitty man. You're like his fuckin' idol. He wants to be just like you man. He likes you more than I do. I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein' lied to. Remember when we met in Denver. You said if I write to you, you would write back. See I'm just like you in a way. I never knew my father neither. He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her. I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs. So when I have a shitty day. I drift away and put 'em on. Cause I don't really got shit else. So that shit helps when I'm depressed. I even got a tattoo. With your name across the chest. Sometimes I even cut myself. To see how much it bleeds?. It's like Adrenaline. The pain is such a sudden rush for me. See everything you say is real. And I respect you 'cause you tell it. My girlfriend's jealous. 'Cause I talk about you 24/7. But she don't know you like. I know you Slim, no one does. She don't know what it was like?. For people like us growing up. You've gotta call me man. I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose. Sincerely yours, Stan. P.S. We should be together too. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?. Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad. It's not so bad. Dear Mister, I'm too good to call or write my fans. This'll be the last package I ever send your ass. It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?. I know you got my last two letters. I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect. So this is my cassette I'm sending you. I hope you hear it. I'm in the car right now. I'm doing 90 on the freeway. Hey Slim, I drink a fifth of vodka. Ya dare me to drive?. You know this song by Phil Collins. 'From the air in the night'. About that guy who could have saved. That other guy from drowning?. But didn't, then Phil saw it all. Then at his show he found him. That's kinda how this is. You could have rescued me from drowning. Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers, now I'm drowsy. And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call. I hope you know. I ripped all  your pictures off the wall. I loved you Slim, we could have been together. Think about it, you ruined it now. I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it. And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep. And you scream about it. I hope your conscious eats at you. And you can't breathe without me. See Slim, "Shut up bitch!. I'm trying to talk". Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk. But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up. See I ain't like you. 'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more. And then she'll die too. Well gotta go. I'm almost at the bridge now. Oh shit! I forgot!. How am I supposed to send this shit out?. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?. Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad. It's not so bad. Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner. But I've just been busy. You said your girlfriend's pregnant now. How far along is she?. Look I'm really flattered. You would call your daughter that. And here's an autograph for your brother. I wrote it on your starter cap. I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show. I must have missed you. Don't think I did that shit intentionally. Just to diss you. And what's this shit you said about. You like to cut your wrist too?. I say that shit just clownin' dawg. C'mon, how fucked up is you?. You got some issues Stan. I think you need some counselin''. To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls. When you get down some. And what's this shit about us. Meant to be together?. That type of shit'll make me not want us. To meet each other. I really think you and your girlfriend. Need each other. Or maybe you just need to treat her better. I hope you get to read this letter. I just hope it reaches you in time. Before you hurt yourself. I think that you'll be doin' just fine. If you'd relax a little. I'm glad I inspire you. But Stan, why are you so mad?. Try to understand. That I do want you as a fan. I just don't want you to do some crazy shit. I seen this one shit on the news. A couple weeks ago that made me sick. Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge. And had his girlfriend in the trunk. And she was pregnant with his kid. And in the car they found a tape. But it didn't say who it was to?. Come to think about it. His name was, it was you! Damn!May I have your attention please?. May I have your attention please?. Will, The Real Slim Shady please stand up?. I repeat will, The Real Slim Shady please stand up?. We're gonna have a problem here. Y'all act like you never seen a white person before. Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door. And started whoopin' her ass worse than before. They first were divorce, throwin' her over furniture. It's the return of the, "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding. He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?". And Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots. Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement!. Feminist women love Eminem. Chigga chigga chigga, "Slim shady, I'm sick of him. Look at him, walkin' around grabbin' his you-know-what. Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though!". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms. Sometimes, I wanna get on T.V. and just let loose, but can't. But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose. "My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips. And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss". And that's the message that we deliver to little kids. And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is. Of course they gonna know what intercourse is. By the time they hit fourth grade. They got the discovery channel don't they?. "We ain't nothing but mammals", well, some of us cannibals. Who cut other people open like cantaloupes. But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes. Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope. But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote. Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes. I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records. Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too. You think I give a damn about a Grammy?. Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me. "But slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?". Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?. So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?. Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs. So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst. And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first. You little bitch, put me on blast on M.T.V. "Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!". I should download her audio on MP3. And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD. I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me. So I have been sent here to destroy you. And there's a million of us just like me. Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me. Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me. And just might be the next best thing but not quite me. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin' you. Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room. The only difference is I got the balls to say it. In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all. I just get on the mic and spit it. And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it. Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can. Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums. It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty. I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting. Pinchin' nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with jergens. And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working. And every single person is a slim shady lurkin'. He could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings. Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!". With his windows down and his system up. So, will the real shady please stand up?. And put one of those fingers on each hand up?. And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control. And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?. I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. Ha ha. Guess there's a slim shady in all of us. Fuck it, let's all stand upOoh hey, yeah. Hush, just stop, there's nothing you can do or say, baby. I've had enough, I'm not your property as from today, baby. You might think that I won't make it on my own. But now I'm. Stronger than yesterday. Now it's nothing but my way. My lonliness ain't killing me no more. I, I'm stronger. Than I ever thought that I could be, baby. I used to go with the flow, didn't really care 'bout me. You might think that I can't take it, but you're wrong. 'Cause now I'm. Stronger than yesterday. Now it's nothing but my way. My lonliness ain't killing me no more. I, I'm stronger. Come on, now. Oh, yeah. Here I go on my own. I don't need nobody, better off alone. Here I go on my own now. I don't need nobody, not anybody. Here I go, alright, here I go. Stronger than yesterday. It's nothing but my way. My lonliness ain't killing me no more. I, I'm. Stronger than yesterday. Now it's nothing but my way. My lonliness ain't killing me no more. Now I'm. Stronger than yesterday. Now it's nothing but my way. My lonliness ain't killing me no more. I, I'm strongerNAWhatever, Dre, just let it run. Aiyyo, turn the beat up a little bit. Aiyyo, this song is for anyone, fuck it. Just shut up and listen, aiyyo. I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag. Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be. The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth. And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse. And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works. And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve. All this tension dispensin' these sentences. Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest. And I rest again peacefully. (Peacefully). But at least have the decency in you. To leave me alone when you freaks see me out. In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter. To not come and speak to me. (Speak to me). I don't know you and no. I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing. I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think. I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick. If you tempt me, my tank is on empty. (Is on empty). No patience is in me and if you offend me. I'm liftin' you 10 feet in the air. (Liftin' you 10 feet). I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you. Go, call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit. I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe. I'm tired of all you. (Of all you). I don't mean to be mean. But that's all I can be is just me. And I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am. Radio won't even play my jam. 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am. I don't know it's just the way I am. Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered. With all of this nonsense, it's constant. And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song. 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses". And all of this controversy circles me. And it seems like the media immediately. Points a finger at me. (Finger at me). So I point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie. Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up. When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up. With the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too. When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school. And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin. (On Marilyn). Where were the parents at? And look where it's at. Middle America, now, it's a tragedy. Now, it's so sad to see, an upper class city. Havin' this happenin'. (This happenin'). Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way. (Rap this way). But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire. To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned. And I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am. Radio won't even play my jam. 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am. I don't know it's just the way I am. I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired. That I wish that I would just die or get fired. And dropped from my label and stop with the fables. I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name is". And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation. To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations. And I just do not got the patience. (Got the patience). To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think. I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk. With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin'. The same fuckin' questions. (Fuckin' questions). What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?. The why, the who what when, the where and the how. 'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out. 'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it. (Drivin' me crazy). I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit. And I'm thankful for every fan that I get. But I can't take a shit in the bathroom. Without someone standin' by it. No, I won't sign your autograph. You can call me an asshole I'm glad. 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am. Radio won't even play my jam. 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am.

There you go, yeah, yo yo. Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?. I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against. Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times. Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind. All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'. Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'. Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'. Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'. Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth. See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out. Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now. Ain't you mama? I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now. I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin out my closet, ha". I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it. So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it. I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73. Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD. I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months. My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch. 'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye. No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die. I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side. Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work wit her. At least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes. But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today. What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb. But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun. 'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both. It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show. I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha". Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition. Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'. But put yourself in my position, just try to envision. Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen. Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'. Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome. My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't. 'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?. Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?. So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?. But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when yaw lonely. And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony. And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful. But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral. See what hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong. Screw this song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom. But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get. You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in Hell for this shit. Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?. Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!. I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"Passion, instant.

I don't think you're ready for this thing. You're not ready. I don't think you're ready for this thing. This thing, this thing. I don't think you're ready for this thing. Constant pressures. No scale can measure. Secret treasures. Keeps on getting better. Do you wanna roll with me?. We can go to foreign lands. Your hand in my hand. Do you wanna ride with me?.

YeahThese ideas are nightmares for white parents. Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings. Like whatever they say has no bearin'. Its so scary in a house that allows no swearin'. To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'. Alone in his own zone cold and he don't care. He's a problem child what bothers him all comes out. When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out. 'Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him out. But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out. His thoughts are whacked he's mad so he's talkin' back. Talkin' black brainwashed from rock and rap. He sags his pants two rags and a stockin' cap. His step father hit him so he socked him back. And broke his nose this house is a broken home. There's no control he just lets his emotions go. (C'mon). Sing with me. (Sing). Sing for the year. (Sing). Sing for the laughter. Sing for the tear. (C'mon). Sing with me just for today. Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away. Entertainment is danger intertwine it with gangsters. In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum. Only you're unholy only have one homey. Only this gun lonely 'cuz don't anyone know me. But everybody just feels like they can relate. I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great. Or they can be great or even worse they can teach hate. Its like kids hang on every single statement we make. Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum. Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?. From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'. To havin' a fortune no more kissin' ass. But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you. Fans turn on you attorney's all gonna turn it to. To get their hands on every dime you have. They want you to lose your mind every time you mad. So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon. You need to spew don't hesitate to produce air guns. Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me. Swiftly just to get me off these streets quickly. But all their kids been listen to me religiously. So I'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me. They're for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me. If I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense, Pete. It's all political if my music is literal and I'm a criminal. How the fuck can I raise a little girl?. I couldn't I wouldn't be fit to. You're full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you. Sing with me. (Sing). Sing for the year. (Sing). Sing for the laughter. Sing for the tear. (C'mon). Sing with me just for today. Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away. They say music can alter moods and talk to you. But can it load a gun for you and cock it too?. Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude. Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued. See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols. And they want to get one 'cos they think the shit's cool. Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves. We're entertainers of course this shit's affectin' our sales. You ignoramus but music is reflection of self. We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail. It's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin'. To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted. It's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing. Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine. Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long. Idolize their favorite rappers and know all they songs. Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives. So they sit and they cry at night wishin' they die. Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe. We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes. That's why we seize the moment and try to freeze it and own it. Squeeze it and hold it 'cos we consider these minutes golden. And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone. Just let our spirits live on through out lyrics that you hear in our songs. And we can. Sing with me. (Sing). Sing for the year. (Sing). Sing for the laughter. Sing for the tear. (C'mon). Sing with me just for today. Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away. Sing with me. (Sing). Sing for the year. (Sing). Sing for the laughter. Sing for the tear. (C'mon). Sing with me just for today. Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you awayNew York City. You are now rapping with 50 cent. You gotta love it. I just wanna chill and twist a lot. Catch suns in my 7-45. You drive me crazy shorty I. Need to see you and feel you next to me. I provide everything you need and I.

I'm just psycho. I go a little bit crazy sometimes. I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes. Good God, dip, do a little slide. Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide. Up the center of the dance floor. Like TP for my bung hole. And it's cool if you let one go. Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?. Give a little poot poot, it's okay. (Poot). Oops my CD just skipped.

Well I'm sorry,. I don't remember. All I know is this much,. I'm not guilty. They said, "Save it, boy we got you on tape. Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body". Now this is the part where the rap breaks down. It's real intense, no one makes a sound. Everything looks like it's '8 Mile' now. The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves. Now snap back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit. Oh you signed me up to battle?. I'm a grown man. Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba.

Um, num, num, touch my body,. Oh boy, just touch my body.. I mean girl just touch my bodyI don't know dude. I think everybody's all jealous and shit. 'Cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude. And I think everybody's got a fuckin problem with me dude. And they need to take it up with me after the show. Because. These chicks don't even know the name of my band. But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands. 'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man. All because I'm the lead singer of my band. So I get off stage right, drop the mic. Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like. "Waasup ladies? My name's Slim Shady. I'm the lead singer of D12 baby". They're all like, "Oh my God it's him!. Becky oh my fucking God! It's Eminem!. I swear to fucking God, dude you fucking rock!. Please, won't you please, let me suck your cock?". And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous. Specially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas. All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes. Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage. So like every single night they pick a fight with me. But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry. 'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me. Dude I just think you're trying to steal the light from me. Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me. 'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be. This rock star shit, it's the life for me. And all the other guys just despise me because. These chicks don't even know the name of my band. But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands. 'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man. All because I'm the lead singer of my band. My band my band my band my band. My band my band my band my band. My band baby. You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you. Hey dad how come we don't rap on proto?. Smash these vocals and do a performance. But we in the van and he in a tour bus. You don't want my autograph, youse a liar. And no I'm Swift oh I thought you were Kuniva. What the hell is wrong with our dressing room?. 'Cause our shit is lookin smaller than a decimal. See I know how to rap, it's simple but. All I did was read a Russell Simmons book. So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map. Doing jumpin jacks whiling get whipped on my back. Look at 'em little punk ass thinking he the shit. Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick. Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue. No I had an interview, not you two. You gonna be late for soundcheck. Man I ain't gonna soundcheck.

These chicks don't even know the name of my band. But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands. 'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man. All because I'm the lead singer of my band. They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not. Went from sold out arenas to the amusement parks. I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot. I should cut his mic off when the music starts. Ready to snap on a dumbass fan. Every time I hear,"Hey dude I love your band". We ain't a band bitch, we don't play instruments. So why he get ninty and we only get ten percent?. And these guys acting funny every area code. Proof carry my bag, bitch carry your own. Can't make it to the stage, security in my way.

Yeah yeah yeah. Turn around from the back and um i like that. Let me see it from the front and uh i like that. Yeah you know how we do. Turn around. Come here. Let me see ya backIn one single moment, your whole life can turn round. I stand there for a minute, staring straight into the ground. Looking to the left slightly, then looking back down. The world feels like it's caved in, proper sorry frown. Please let me show you where we could only just be for us. I can change, and I can grow, or we could adjust. The wicked thing about us is we always have trust. We can even have an open relationship if you must. I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me. But her eyes glaze over, like she's looking straight through me. Her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity. When they open up she's looking down at her feet. Dry your eyes mate. I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up. There's plenty more fish in the sea. Dry your eyes mate. I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts. But you've got to walk away now, it's over. So then I move my hand up and down by my side. It's shaking; my life is crashing before my eyes. I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies. Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh. 'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me. There's things I can't imagine doing. Things I can't imagine seeing. It weren't supposed to be easy, surely. Please, please, I'm begging, please. She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested. She wraps her fingers around mine with the softness she's blessed with. She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures. By pushing my hand away to my chest, from hers. Dry your eyes mate. I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up. There's plenty more fish in the sea. Dry your eyes mate. I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts. But you've got to walk away now, it's over. And I'm just standing there. I can't say a word. Because everything is just gone. I've got nothing. Absolutely nothing. Trying to pull her close out of bear desperation. Put my arms around her, trying to change what she's saying. Pull my head level with hers so that she might engage in. Look in to her eyes to make her listen again. I'm not gonna fucking just fucking leave it all now. 'Cause you said it'd be forever, and that was your vow. And your gonna let our things simply crash and fall down. You're well out of order now, this is well out of town. She pulls away my arms, tightly clamped round her waist. Gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight. Turns around so she's now got her back to my face. Takes one step forward, looks back, then walks away. Dry your eyes mate. I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up. There's plenty more fish in the sea. Dry your eyes mate. I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts. But you've got to walk away now, it's over. I know in the past I've found it hard to say. Telling you things, but not telling straight. But the more I pull on your hand and say. The more you pull away. Dry your eyes mate. I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up. There's plenty more fish in the sea. Dry your eyes mate. I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts. But you've got to walk away nowNADrop down and get your eagle on, girl. Drop down and get your eagle on, girl.

I'm use to trying to reline. I've been trying to be sign. Trying to be a millionaire. How I use two lifelines. In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died. The doctor said I had blood clots.

And you don't even call no more?. We don't barely keep in touch at all. And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more. And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now. After all the years we been down. Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true. We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you. We were so young, so full of life and vivrance side by side. Wherever you was ridin' I went. So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit. When Ronnie died you was right by my side with a shoulder to cry on. A tissue to wipe my eyes,. And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it. You even had the same type of childhood I did. Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succumb to yours?. And mine I survived it, you ran the streets, I 9 to 5'd it. We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then I blew up. To both yours and mine surprises. Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it. As much as your pride tries to hide it. Your cold to touch it's just like ice. In your eyes is the look of resentment. I can sense it, and I don't like it. How come we don't even talk no more?. And you don't even call no more?. We don't barely keep in touch at all. And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more. And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now. After all the years we been down. Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true. We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you. It was my dream at first to be on spittin' a verse. On my own album with a deal but shit got worse. So I came out I woulda killed a nigga first. Before I let him disrespect me and check me over some worst. Some bitch that I wasn't with I would hit her then quit. But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit. I told you don't get involved wit her, you was smokin' the chron with her. Comin' out of the bar with her stumblin' half drunk. Like y'all was husband and wife or somethin'. But me catchin' her fuckin' other niggers. Must've hurt you pride or somethin'. 'Cuz you went off at the mouth with people like you wanted with me. When all I tried to do was show your bitch was shifty. And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced. You actin' like I ain't ya man and lyin' like she can't be loose. But I am really you friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth. Don't hate the game or the player. The one that is changing is you. How come we don't even talk no more?. And you don't even call no more?. We don't barely keep in touch at all. And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more. And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now. After all the years we been down. Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true. We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you. Its gettin' only at the top 'cuz my homie had to stop. Now we actin' like I gotta live only for the block. And homies in the hood only see me on the tube. So they gossip on the porch get to speakin' all rude. Fools I used to rap with all expect magic. Like my finger get to snappin and 'poof' it just happen. But Proof is just actin' out the part he was thrown. Shady made it so my baby's ain't starvin' at home. See the devil in your grin since the ghetto we been friends. Forever real intelligence thats forever till the end. I keep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lies. Ain't wastin' my times with these snakes in disguise. How come, when you talk its with bitter respite?. And how come, it's my fault for what you did with your life?. And every time I go to hear you and play you look away. We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face. How come we don't even talk no more?. And you don't even call no more?. We don't barely keep in touch at all. And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more. And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now. After all the years we been down. Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true. We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's youYeeah. (Ooh baby). Lil' Flipper. (Ooh baby). My girl Lea. Sunshine, I can call you my baby boy. You can call me your baby girl.

(OHHH!). o wee ...Yeah, uh huh<br />. La da da da da da<br />. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry<br />. <br />. Hey, baby my nose is getting big<br />. I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs<br />. Now you say your trust's getting weaker<br />. Probably â€~coz my lies just started getting deeper<br />. <br />. And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson<br />. And I really think you ought to know the truth<br />. Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more<br />. But after I did it I don't know what I did it for<br />. <br />. I admit that I have been a little immature<br />. F****** with your heart like I was the predator<br />. In my book of lies I was the editor<br />. And the author, I forged my signature<br />. <br />. And now I apologize for what I did to ya<br />. 'Cos what you did to me I did to you<br />. <br />. No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie<br />. No, no, no, no, yeah, you know, know, know, know<br />. You gotta try<br />. What you gonna do when it all comes out?<br />. When I really see you, what you're all about?<br />. <br />. No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie<br />. â€~Cause you know, you know, you know<br />. You know, you know you gotta try<br />. <br />. She said, â€½I'm leavingâ€, â€~cos she can't take the pain<br />. It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same<br />. Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain<br />. Too many lies committed, too many games<br />. <br />. She feeling like a fool, getting on the last train<br />. Trying to maintain but the feeling won't change<br />. I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became<br />. Caught up in living my life in the fast lane<br />. <br />. Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame<br />. I don't know the reason why I did these things<br />. <br />. And I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie<br />. And now our emotions are drained<br />. 'Cos I lie and I lie and a little lie lie<br />. And now your emotions are drained<br />. <br />. No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie<br />. (No, don't you lie)<br />. No, no, no, no, yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try<br />. (Got to try, got to try)<br />. What you gonna do when it all comes out?<br />. (What you gonna do baby?)<br />. When I really see you and what you're all about?<br />. <br />. No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie<br />. Because you know, you know, you know<br />. You know, you know you gotta try<br />. <br />. Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo<br />. Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo<br />. Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo<br />. Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo<br />. <br />. Ooh hoo ooo ooo, ooh hoo ooo<br />. (Ba da, ba da, ba ba ba ba, badada badada badada badada)<br />. Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo<br />. Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo<br />. (Ba da, ba da, ba ba ba ba, badada badada badada badada)<br />. Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo<br />. <br />. Yo, I'm lying to my girl, even though I love her<br />. And she all in my world<br />. I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls<br />. She the one who makes me feel on top of the world<br />. Still I'm lying to my girl, I do it<br />. <br />. And I lie and I lie and I lie and<br />. I lie till there's no turning back<br />. I don't know why I lie and I lie<br />. (And I lie and I lie â€~til I don't know who I am)<br />. <br />. Then I tell myself<br />. No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie<br />. (Don't you lie)<br />. No, no, no, no, yeah, you know, know, know, know<br />. You gotta try<br />. (You know, you know you gotta)<br />. <br />. What you gonna do when it all comes out?<br />. When I really see you, what you're all about?<br />. No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie<br />. No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no<br />. Stop, stop stop, stop, stop stop<br />. Stop lyingStep by step, heart to heart. Left right left, we all fall down. Step by step, heart to heart, left right left. We all fall down like toy soldiers. Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win. But the battle wages on for toy soldiers. I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure. Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders. I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it. Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter. I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless. I absolutely have to I'm supposed to set an example. I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em. If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em. That Ja crap I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it. There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it. I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it. It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and nas shit. And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it. I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted. And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it. This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it. That was never my object for someone to get killed. Why would I wanna destroy something I help build. It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good. I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'. Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth. And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about. Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef. So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth. While he's all over TV yeah I'm talkin' a man who literally saved my life. Like fuck it I understand this is business. And this shit just isn't none of my business. But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause. Step by step, heart to heart, left right left. We all fall down like toy soldiers. Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win. But the battle wages on for toy soldiers. There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme. And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'. But now it's elevated 'cuz once you put someone's kids in it. The shlit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?. It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'. We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'. Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him. And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him. Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him. fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it. Mean while my attention is pullin' in another direction. Some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk. Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection. Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record. But now he's fucked the game up 'cuz one of the ways I came up. Was through that publication the same one that made me famous. Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'. Well fuck it, that mother fucker can get it too, fuck him then. But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think. That we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc. And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind. We still have soldiers that's on the front line. That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders. Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us. We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a. To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is. To have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners. Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is. But I ain't try'na have none of my people hurt or murdered. It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it. Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict. I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further. But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'. I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'. Off at your jaws well then I can 'cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'. I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cuz. Step by step, heart to heart, left right left. We all fall down like toy soldiers. Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win. But the battle wages on for toy soldiersHit 'em with a little Ghetto Gospel. Those who wish to follow me. (My Ghetto Gospel). I welcome with my hands. And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold. And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns. If I could recollect before my hood days. I'd sit and remanence thinkin' of bliss of the good days. I stop and stare at the younger my heart goes to em. Aids tested it was stress that they under. And nowadays things change. Everyone's ashamed of the youth. 'Cuz the truth look strange and for me it's reversed. We left them a world that's cursed and it hurts. 'Cuz any day they'll push the button and all good men. Like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothin'. Told 'em they could get teary the world looks dreary. When you wipe your eyes see it clearly. There's no need for you to fear me. If you take your time to hear me. Maybe you can learn to cheer me it ain't about black or white. 'Cuz we're human I hope we see the light before it's ruined. My Ghetto Gospel. Those who wish to follow me. (Ghetto Gospel). I welcome with my hands. And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold. And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns. Tell me do you see that old lady, ain't it sad?. Livin' outta bags but she's glad for the little things she has. And over there there's a lady crack got her crazy. Yet she's givin' birth to a baby. I don't trip and let it fade me from outta the frying pan. We jump into another form of slavery. Even now I get discouraged wonder if they take it all back. Will I still keep the courage?. I refuse to be a role model I set goals, stay in control. Drink out my own bottles I made mistakes. But learned from every one and when it's said and done. I bet this brother be a better one. If I upset you don't stress never forget. That God hasn't finished with me yet. I feel His hand on my brain when I write rhymes. I go blind and let the Lord do His thing. But am I less holy 'cuz I chose to puff a blunt. And drink a beer with my homies. Before we find world peace we gotta find peace. And end the war in the streets my Ghetto Gospel. Those who wish to follow me. (Yeah, Ghetto Gospel). I welcome with my hands. And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold. And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns.

What you crying about?. You got me. Hailie, I know you miss your mom. And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone. But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had. I can see you're sad. Even when you smile. Even when you laugh. I can see it in your eyes. Deep inside, you wanna cry. 'Cause you're scared. I ain't there?. Daddy's with you in your prayers. No more crying. Wipe them tears. Daddy's here. No more nightmares. We gonna pull together through it. We gon' do it. Laney, uncle's crazy ain't he?. Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it. We're all we got in this world. When it spins. When it swirls. When it whirls. When it twirls. Two little beautiful girls. Looking puzzled, in a daze. I know it's confusing you. Daddy's always on the move. Mama's always on the news. I try to keep you sheltered from it. But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that. The more it backfires on me. All the things, growing up. As daddy that he had to see. Daddy don't want you to see. But you see just as much as he did. We did not plan it to be this way. Your mother and me. But things have got so bad between us. I don't see us ever being together ever again. Like we used to be when was teenagers. But then of course. Everything always happens for a reason. I guess it was never meant to be. But it's just something. We have no control over. And that's what destiny is. But no more worries. Rest your head and go to sleep. Maybe one day we'll wake up. And this will all just be a dream. Now hush little baby don't you cry. Everythings gonna be alright. Stiffen that upper lip up little lady. I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya. Through the night. I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why. We feel how we feel inside. It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby. But I promise, Mama's gonna be alright. It's funny. I remember back one year when daddy had no money. Mommy wrapped the Christamas presents up. And stuck them under the tree. And said some of them were from me. 'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em. I'll never forget that Christmas. I sat up the whole night cryin'. 'Cause daddy felt like a bum. See daddy had a job. But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom. And at the time, every house that we lived in. Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block. And your mom, was saving money. For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you. So you can go to college. Almost had a thousand dollars. 'Till someone broke in and stole it. And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart. And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart. Mom and dad was arguing a lot. So mama moved back on the Chalmers in the flat. One bedroom apartment. And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra. And that's when daddy went to California with his CD. And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me. But daddy had to work. You and mama had to leave me. Then you started seeing daddy on the TV. And mama didn't like it. And you and Laney were too young to understand it. Papa was a rolling stone. Mama developed a habit. And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it. I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand. 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud. Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'. Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out. To see how much you both have grown. It's almost like your sisters now. Wow, I guess you pretty much are. And daddy's still here. Laney I'm talking to you too. Daddy's still here. I like the sound of that, yeah. It's got a ring to it, don't it?. Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment. Now hush little baby don't you cry. Everythings gonna be alright. Stiffen that upper lip up little lady. I told ya daddy's here to hold ya. Through the night. I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why. We feel how we feel inside. It may seem a little crazy pretty baby. But I promise. Mama's gonna be alright. And if you ask me to. Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird. I'mma give you the world. I'mma buy a diamond ring for you. I'mma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile. And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine. I'mma break that birdy's neck. I'll go back to the jewler who sold it to ya. And make him eat every karat. Don't fuck with dad, hahaDiamonds are forever. They won't leave in the night. I've no fear that they might. Desert me. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever). The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.. Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?.... Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic. Vegas on acid,. Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses. And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz. It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does. he write his own rhymes, so sort of. I think 'em. That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up. Damn, is he really that caught up?. I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?. I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder. so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche. - its for yourself that's important. If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men. Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan. Excuse me,. That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever). The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.. Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?.... I was sick about awards. Couldn't nobody cure me. Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry. Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them. 30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them. What more can you ask for?. The international assholes nah. Who complains about what he is owed?. And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old. You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul. And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,. When he came, in the game, he made his own lane. Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name. Its Kanye - But some of my plastic - they still say Kane. Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown. Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown. Life movin' too fast I need to slow down. Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). My father Ben said I need Jesus. So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). The preacher said we need leaders. Right then my body got still like a paraplegic. You know who you can call you gotta best believe it. The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it. Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic. Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic. After debris settles and the dust get swept off. Big K pick up where young Hov left off. Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off. I dropped my new shit sound like the best of. A&R;'s lookin' like "pssh we messed up". Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up. Bottle after bottle till we got messed up. In the studio, where really though, yea he next up. People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back. That'll be the same day I give the game back. You know the next question dog "Yo, where Dame at?". This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back. "What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?". They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen. R-r-r-right here stands a-man. With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands.... Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe. Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever). The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.. Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?.... Diamonds are forever (forever, forever). Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)Dat laffy taffy (candy gurl). Gurl shake dat laffy taffy. Dat laffy taffy.

[Verse 1]. Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?. Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?. When they know they're your heart. And you know you were their armour. And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em. But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?. And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?. What happens when you become the main source of a pain?. "Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane. "Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?". I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy. Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself. I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself. Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her. And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her. That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy. Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby.... . [Chorus]. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain. Just smile back. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain. Just smile back.... . [Verse 2]. I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing. She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing. "You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?". Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying. "You always say that, you always say this is the last time. "But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine". She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it. "Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!". Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket. It's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'". I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror. These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em. They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight. Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late. And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door. It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on. And I'm singing.... . [Chorus]. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain. Just smile back. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain. Just smile back.... . [Verse 3]. Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat. The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet. I take a bow and thank you all for coming out. They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd. I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing. "Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,". But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?. "I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'. "You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad. "And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'. "That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin. "I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are gone". But baby wait, "it's too late Dad, you made the choice. "Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us". That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name. It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill. Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real. I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see. How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me. I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it. Put it to my brain and scream "die Shady" and pop it. The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes. That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'. It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her. Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister. Almost as if to say... . [Chorus/Outro]. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain. Just smile back. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling.

Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone.. She said "Some days I feel like shit. .... Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit,". I don't understand why you have to always be gone. I get along but the trips always feel so long. And, I find myself tryna stay by the phone. 'Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone. But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call. But when I pick up I don't have much to say. So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up. That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'. Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career. Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?". I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone.. Where'd you go?. I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone. Please come back home.... You know the place where you used to live. Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs. Used to have a little party every Hallowe'en with candy by the pile. But now, you only stop by every once in a while. Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time. Anything to keep the thought of you from my mind. I'm doin' fine, I plan to keep it that way. You can call me if you find you have somethin' to say. And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up. That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'. Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career. Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?". I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone.. Where'd you go?. I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone. Please come back home.... I want you to know it's a little fucked up. That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'. Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses. For while you're not around, and feeling so useless. It seems one thing has been true all along. You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone. I guess I've had it with you and your career. When you come back I won't be here and you'll can sing it.... Where'd you go?. I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone.. Where'd you go?. I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone. Please come back home. Please come back home. Please come back home. Please come back home. ....

Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust. Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus. Kiss my butt, lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts. It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks. It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed. Bitches lust, man they love me when I'm laying the cut. Missed the cut, the lady give a eighty some paper cut. Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought. Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce.

I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz. Driving around with a smashed front end. Let's cash that one in. Grab another one from out the stable. The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado. The hell if I know. Do I want leather seats or vinyl?. Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision. Or Maico beats quake like Waco.

Shorty, I'll be over there. I'll be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there. And you don't even have to ask twice. You could have my heart or we can share it like the last slice. Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life. Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life. Sweatpants hair tied chillin' with no make-up on. That's when you're the prettiest. I hope that you don't take it wrong. You don't even trip when friends say. You ain't bringin' Drake along. You know that I'm workin'. I'll be there as soon as I make it home. And she a patient in my waitin' room. Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume. And until them girls prove it. I'm the one that never get confused wit cause. Baby, you my everything. You all I ever wanted. We could do it real big. Bigger than you ever done it. You'll be up on everything. Other hoes ain't ever on it. I want this forever. I swear I can spend whatever on it.

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit. Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc. When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture. And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister. Magazine, paper girl, but money ain't the issue. They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial. She call me 'the referee' cause I be so official. My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle. Like the Andy Griffith theme song. And who told you to put them jeans on?. Double cup love, you the one I lean on. Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on. Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot. Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot.

Just make sure they that special somebody. Young money. Yeah, yeah. You know who you are.... I got youYeah, It's been a ride.... I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one. Now some of you might still be in that place. If you're trying to get out, just follow me. I'll get you there. You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em. But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em. Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem. When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn. What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world. Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me. I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly. And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony. No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he. From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n. Whether he's on salary, paid hourly. Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him. Whichever comes first, for better or worse. He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas. His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge. To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe. I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let you know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road. Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap. I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap. You said you was king, you lied through your teeth. For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped. And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back. I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact. Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehhhh". Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground. Relax, I ain't going back to that now. All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW. Cause I ain't playin' around. There's a game called circle and I don't know how. I'm way too up to back down. But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out. Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't. This fucking black cloud still follow's me around. But it's time to exorcise these demons. These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!. I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let you know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road. And I just can't keep living this way. So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage. I'm standing up, Imma face my demons. I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground. I've had enough, now I'm so fed up. Time to put my life back together right now. It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me. Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you. So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through. And don't even realise what you did, believe me you. I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger. I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of. My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead. No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise. To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father. So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it. You couldn't lift a single shingle on it. Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club. Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up. Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon. But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and. I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just let you know that, you're not alone. Holla if you feel that you've been down the same roadI was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me. Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gonna be. Opened my eyes, yeah. It was only just a dream. So I traveled back down that road. Wish she'd come back, no one knows. I realized, yeah. It was only just a dream. I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement. Number one spot, now she found her a replacement. I swear now, I can't take it. Knowing somebody's got my baby. And now you ain't around, baby, I can't think. I should've put it down, should've got that ring. 'Cause I can still feel it in the air. See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair. My lover, my life. My shorty, my wife. She left me, I'm tight. 'Cause I knew that it just ain't right. I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me. Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gonna be. Opened my eyes, yeah. It was only just a dream. So I traveled back down that road. Wish she'd come back, no one knows. I realized, yeah. It was only just a dream. When I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn. Tryin' to get my Usher on but I can't let it burn. And I just hope that she know that she the only one I yearn. For, moreover, I miss her, when will I learn?. Didn't give her all my love, guess now I got my payback. Now I'm in the club, thinkin' all about my baby. Hey, she was so easy to love. But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough. I'm goin' through it every time that I'm alone. And now I miss her and wishin' she'd pick up the phone. But she made the decision that she wanted to move on. 'Cause I was wrong. I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me. Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gonna be. Opened my eyes, yeah. It was only just a dream. So I traveled back down that road. Wish she'd come back, no one knows. I realized, yeah. It was only just a dream. If you ever loved somebody, put your hands up. If you ever loved somebody, put your hands up. And now they gone and you wishin'. You could give them everything. Said if you ever loved somebody, put your hands up. If you ever loved somebody, put your hands up. And now they gone and you wishin'. You could give them everything. I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me. Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gonna be. Opened my eyes, yeah. It was only just a dream. So I traveled back down that road. Wish she'd come back, no one knows. I realized, yeah. It was only just a dream. I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me. Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gonna be. Opened my eyes, yeah. It was only just a dream. So I traveled back down that road. Wish she'd come back, no one knows. I realized, yeah. It was only just a dreamNAI'm more than just an option.

Faded (Drank) Faded (Drank). Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles. Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago. Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows. Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem. I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon. That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood. Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat. Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me:. Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?. I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch. First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it. Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it. I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock. All the girls wanna play Baywatch. I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it.

I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick. If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit. I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'. The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived. This how you capitalize, this is parental advice. Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'. I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me:. Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?. I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch. First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it. Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it.

And I got hunger, pain, that grow insane. Tell me, do that sound familiar?. If it do, then you're like me. Makin' excuse that your relief. Is in the bottom. Of a bottle. And the greenest indo leaf. As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me. I see you jokin'. Why you laugh?. Don't you feel bad?. I probably sleep. And never ever wake up. Never ever wake up, never ever wake up. In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough. They stomped the homie out over a bitch?. K-dot, you good, blood?.

These bitch ass niggas killed my brother!When I was in the 3rd grade. I thought that I was gay. 'Cause I could draw, my uncle was. And I kept my room straight. I told my mom, tears rushing down my face. She's like, "Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K". Tripping yeah. I guess she had a point, didn't she. A bunch of stereotypes all in my head. I remember doing the math like. "Yeah, I'm good at little league". A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant. For those that like the same sex had the characteristics. The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision. And you can be cured with some treatment and religion. Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition. Playing God. Ahh nah, here we go. America the brave. Still fears what we don't know. And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten. But we paraphrase a book written. 35 hundreds years ago. I don't know. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. My love, my love, my love. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. If I was gay. I would think hip-hop hates me. Have you read the YouTube comments lately?. "Man that's gay". Gets dropped on the daily. We've become so numb to what we're saying. Our culture founded from oppression. Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em. Call each other faggots. Behind the keys of a message board. A word rooted in hate. Yet our genre still ignores it. Gay is synonymous with the lesser. It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion. Gender to skin color. The complexion of your pigment. The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins. Human rights for everybody. There is no difference. Live on! And be yourself!. When I was in church. They taught me something else. If you preach hate at the service. Those words aren't anointed. And that Holy Water. That you soak in. Is then poisoned. When everyone else. Is more comfortable. Remaining voiceless. Rather than fighting for humans. That have had their rights stolen. I might not be the same. But that's not important. No freedom til we're equal. Damn right I support it. I don't know. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. My love, my love, my love. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. We press play. Don't press pause. Progress, march on!. With a veil over our eyes. We turn our back on the cause. 'Till the day. That my uncles can be united by law. Kids are walkin' around the hallway. Plagued by pain in their heart. A world so hateful. Some would rather die. Than be who they are. And a certificate on paper. Isn't gonna solve it all. But it's a damn good place to start. No law's gonna change us. We have to change us. Whatever God you believe in. We come from the same one. Strip away the fear. Underneath it's all the same love. About time that we raised up. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. And I can't change. Even if I tried. Even if I wanted to. My love, my love, my love. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. She keeps me warm. Love is patient, love is kind. Love is patient. Love is kind (not crying on Sundays). Love is patient (not crying on Sundays). Love is kind (not crying on Sundays). Love is patient (not crying on Sundays). Love is kind (not crying on Sundays). Love is patient (not crying on Sundays). Love is kind (not crying on Sundays). Love is patient, love is kindAy, ay, ay. Good to see you. Come on in, let's go. Yeah, let's go, hahaha. Alright, alright, okay, uh. Alright, okay, alright, okay. Return of the Mack. Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't. Looking for a better way to get up out of bed. Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me, get up. Thrift Shop, pimp strut walking. Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious. Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yup. Bad, moonwalking, and this here is our party. My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way, grown music. I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it. And yet I'm on. Let that stage light, go and shine on down. Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style. Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds. But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town. Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin'. Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four-track buzzing. Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'. Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothing. We give that to the people, spread it across the country. Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothing. We give it to the people, spread it across the country. Can we go back? This is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us. Can we go back? This is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us. Now, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah, I'm so damn grateful. I grew up really wanting gold fronts. But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you. Y'all can't stop me. Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat. And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed. To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw. Tell me go up, gone. Deuces, goodbye, I've got a world to see. And my girl, she wanna see Rome. Caesar'll make you a believer. Nah, I never ever did it for a throne. That validation comes from giving it back to the people. Now, sing that song and it goes like. Raise those hands, this is our party. We came here to live life like nobody was watching. I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me. Learn from that failure, gain humility, and now we keep marching, I said. Can we go back? This is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us. Can we go back? This is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us. And so we put our hands up. And so we put our hands up. Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh. Let's go.

Mack-le-oh-oh-oh-oh-more. Can we go back? This is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us. Can we go back? This is the moment. Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us.
