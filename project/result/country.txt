On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid. Little White Dove was her name, such a lovely sight to see. But their tribes fought with each other, so their love could never be. Running Bear loved Little White Dove. With a love big as the sky. Running Bear loved Little White Dove. With a love that couldn't die. He couldn't swim the raging river 'cause the river was too wide. He couldn't reach the Little White Dove waiting on the other side. In the moonlight he could see her throwing kisses 'cross the waves. Her little heart was beating faster waiting for her Indian brave. Running Bear loved Little White Dove. With a love big as the sky. Running Bear loved Little White Dove. With a love that couldn't die. Running Bear dove in the water, Little White Dove did the same. And they swam out to each other through the swirling stream they came. As their hands touched and their lips met, the raging river pulled them down. Now they'll always be together in their happy hunting ground. Running Bear loved Little White Dove. With a love big as the sky. Running Bear loved Little White Dove. With a love that couldn't dieIt's over our love affair. Too late now I find I care. His sweet love no more I'll share. Now he's gone I'm alone. I was wrong should have known. Took me home on our last date. I search for a single way. To tell him what I had to say. I kissed him, watched him walk away. Set him free foolishly destiny misery. Tragedy on our last date. Took the ring from my trembling fingers. Brushed a tear from my baby's eye. Walked away didn't know that. I'd soon miss him so. Guess I was too young to realize. So blind I couldn't see. How much he really meant to me. And that soon he would always be. On my mind in my heart I was blind from the start.

Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip. And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John. (Big John, Big John). Big Bad John. (Big John). Nobody seemed to know where John called home. He just drifted into town and stayed all alone. He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy. And if you spoke at all, he just said, "Hi" to Big John. Somebody said he came from New Orleans. Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen. And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand. Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John. (Big John, Big John). Big Bad John. (Big John). Then came the day at the bottom of the mine. When a timber cracked and men started cryin'. Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast. And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John. Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell. Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well. Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan. And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John. (Big John, Big John). Big Bad John. (Big John). And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove. Then a miner yelled out, "There's a light up above". And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave. Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John. With jacks and timbers they started back down. Then came that rumble way down in the ground. And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine. Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John. (Big John, Big John). Big Bad John. (Big John). Now they never reopened that worthless pit. They just placed a marble stand in front of it. These few words are written on that stand. At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John. (Big John, Big John). Big Bad John. (Big John). (Big John). Big Bad JohnI fall to pieces. Each time I see you again. I fall to pieces.

Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid. But the meanest thing that he ever did. Was before he left, he went and named me Sue. Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke. And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk. It seems I had to fight my whole life through. Some gal would giggle and I'd get red. And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head. I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue. Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean. My fist got hard and my wits got keen. I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame. But I made me a vow to the moon and stars. That I'd search the honky tonks and bars. And kill that man who gave me that awful name. Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid July. And I just hit town and my throat was dry. I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew. At an old saloon on a street of mud. There at a table, dealing stud. Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue. Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad. From a worn out picture that my mother had. And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye. He was big and bent and gray and old. And I looked at him and my blood ran cold. And I said, "My name is Sue! How do you do?. Now you're gonna die". Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes. And he went down, but to my surprise. He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair right across his teeth. And we crashed through the wall and into the street. Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer. I tell ya, I've fought tougher men. But I really can't remember when. He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile. I heard him laugh and then I heard him curse. He went for his gun and I pulled mine first. He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile. And he said, "Son, this world is rough. And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough. And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along. So I give you that name and I said goodbye. I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's the name that helped to make you strong". He said, "Now you just fought one hell of a fight. And I know you hate me, and you got the right. To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do. But you ought to thank me, before I die. For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye. 'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue. What could I do? Yeah what could I do?. I got all choked up and I threw down my gun. And I called him my pa, and he called me his son. And I came away with a different point of view. And I think about him, now and then. Every time I try and every time I win. And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him. Bill or George anything but Sue I still hate that nameYou've painted up your lips. And rolled and curled your tinted hair. Ruby are you contemplating. Going out somewhere. The shadow on the wall.

Oh Ruby. Don't take your love to town. She's leaving now cause. I just heard the slamming of the door. The way I know I've heard it. Some 100 times before. And if I could move I'd get my gun.

Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eye. Country roads, take me home. To the place I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma. Take me home, country roads. I hear her voice in the mornin' hour she calls me. Radio reminds me of my home far away. Drivin' down the road I get a feelin'. That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday. Country roads, take me home. To the place I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma. Take me home, country roads. Country roads, take me home. To the place I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma. Take me home, country roads. Take me home, down country roads. Take me home, down country roadsTake the ribbon from my hair. Shake it loose and let it fall. Lay it soft upon my skin. Like the shadows on the wall.. Come and lay down by my side. Til the early mornin' light. All I'm takin' is your time. Help me make it through the night.. Chorus:. I don't care what's right or wrong. I won't try to understand. Let the devil take tomorrow. But tonight I need a friend.. Yesterday is dead and gone. And tomorrow's out of sight. And it's sad to be alone. Help me make it through the night.. (Repeat Chorus)NAThe love between the two of us was dying. And it got so bad I knew I had to leave. But halfway down that highway when I turned around I. saw. My little daughter running after me. Crying. Daddy, don't you walk so fast. Daddy, don't you walk so fast. Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run. Daddy, don't you walk so fast. Now, it broke my heart to tell my little daughter. That her daddy had to run to catch a train. She had no way of knowin' I was leavin' home for good. I turned around and there she was again. As she said to me. Daddy, don't you walk so fast. Daddy, don't you walk so fast. Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run. Daddy, don't you walk so fast. If only for the sake of my sweet daughter. I just had to turn back home right there and then. And try to start a new life with the mother of my. child. I couldn't bear to hear those words again. She cried and said. Daddy, don't you walk so fast. (My daughter cried). Daddy, don't you walk so fast. Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run. Daddy, don't you walk so fast. Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run. Oh, daddy, don't you walk so fastGirl you're gettin' that look in your eyes. And it's startin' to worry me. I ain't ready for no family ties. Nobody's gonna hurry me. Just keep it friendly girl. Cuz I don't wanna leave. Don't start clingin' to me girl. Cuz I can't breathe. Baby baby don't get hooked on me. Baby baby don't get hooked on me. Cuz I'll just use you then I'll set you free. Baby baby don't get hooked on me. Girl you're a hot-blooded woman, child. And it's warm where you're touchin' me. But I can tell by your tremblin' smile. You're seein' way too much in me. Girl don't let your life. Get tangled up with mine. Cuz I'll just leave you. I can't take no clingin' vine. Baby baby don't get hooked on me. Baby baby don't get hooked on me. Cuz I'll just use you then I'll set you free. Baby baby don't get hooked on me. Baby baby don't get hooked on me. Baby baby don't get hooked on me. Cuz I'll just use you then I'll set you free. Baby baby don't get hooked on me. Baby baby don't get hooked on meMy baby makes me proud, Lord don't she make me proud. She never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd. 'Cause people like to talk, Lord, don't they love to talk. But when they turn out the lights, I know she'll be leaving with me. And when we get behind closed doors. Then she lets her hair hang down. And she makes me glad that I'm a man. Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors. My baby makes me smile, Lord don't she make me smile. She's never too far away or too tired to say "I want you". She's always a lady, just like a lady should be. But when they turn out the lights, she's still a baby to me. And when we get behind closed doors. Then she lets her hair hang down. And she makes me glad that I'm a man. Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors. Behind closed doorsNAWhy me Lord? What have I ever done. To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known?. Tell me Lord, what did I ever do.

On a dark flat land she rides. On a pony she named Wildfire. With a whirlwind by her side. On a cold Nebraska night. They say she died one winter. When there came a killing frost.

I sat down and asked her name. When the drink finally hit her. She said I'm no quitter. But I finally quit living on dreams. I'm hungry for laughter. And here ever after. I'm after whatever. The other life brings. In the mirror I saw him. And I closely watch him. I thought how he looked out of place. He came to the woman. Who sat their beside me. He had a strange look on his face. The big hands were calloused. He looked like a mountain. For a minute I thought I was dead. But he started shakin'. His big heart was breakin'. He turned to the woman and said. "You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille. Four hungry children and a crop in the field. I've had some bad times. Lived thru' some sad times. But this time your hurtin' won't heal. You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille". After he left us, I ordered more whiskey. I thought how she made him look small. From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room. We walked without talking at all. She was a beauty, but when she came to me. She must have thought I lost my mind. I couldn't hold her, 'coz the words that he told her. Kept coming back time after time. You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille. Four hungry children and a crop in the field. I've had some bad times. Lived thru' some sad times. But this time your hurtin' won't heal. You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille. You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille. Four hungry children and a crop in the field.

Southern night free as a breeze. Not to mention the trees. Whistling tunes that you know and love so. Southern nights just as good even when. Closed your eyes, I apologize.

And here I goThe Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal.. He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal. When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot.. And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said "Boy, let me tell you what.". "I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too.. And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you.. Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due.. I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.". The boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin,. But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.". Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard.. 'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards.. And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold,. But if you lose the devil gets your soul.. The Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show.". And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow.. And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss.. And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this.. When the Devil finished, Johnny said, "Well, you're pretty good ol' son,. But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.". "Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run!. The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;. Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough.. Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no.. The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.. And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet.. Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again,. 'Cause I've told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.". And he played:. "Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run!. The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;. Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough.. Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no.While she lays sleeping. I stay out late at night and play my songs. And sometimes, all the nights can be so long. And it's good when I finally make it home. All alone. While she lays dreaming. I try to get undressed without the light. And quietly she says, "How was your night?". And I come to her and say, "It was all right". And I hold her tight. And she believes in me. I'll never know just what she sees in me. I told her someday, if she was my girl. I could change the world with my little songs. I was wrong. But she has faith in me. And so I go on trying faithfully. And who knows maybe, on some special night. If my song is right, I will find a way. Find a way. While she lays waiting. I stumble to the kitchen for a bite. Then I see my old guitar in the night. Just waiting for me like a secret friend. And there's no end. While she lays crying. I fumble with a melody or two. And I'm torn between the things that I should do. And she says to wake her up when I am through. God, her love is true. And she believes in me. I'll never know just what she sees in me. I told her someday, if she was my girl. I could change the world with my little songs. I was wrong. But she has faith in me. And so I go on trying faithfully. And who knows maybe, on some special night. If my song is right, I will find a way. While she waits, while she waits for meDreamin', I must be dreamin'. Or am I really lyin' here with you?. Baby, you take me in your arms. And though I'm wide awake, I know my dream is comin' true. . And oh, I just fall in love again. Just one touch and then it happens every time. There I go by, just fall in love again and when I do. I can't help myself, I fall in love with you. . Magic, it must be magic. The way I hold you when the night just seems to fly. Easy for you to take me to a star. Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes. . And oh, I just fall in love again. Just one touch and then it happens every time. There I go by, just fall in love again and when I do. I can't help myself, I fall in love with you. . Can't help myself, I fall in love with youLady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you. You have made me what I am and I am yours. My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you. Let me hold you in my arms forever more. You have gone and made me such a fool. I'm so lost in your love. And oh, we belong together. Won't you believe in my song?. Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you. You have come into my life and made me whole. Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning. Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear. In my eyes I see no one else but you. There's no other love like our love. And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me. I've waited for you for so long. Lady, your love's the only love I need. And beside me is where I want you to be. 'Cause, my love, there's somethin' I want you to know. You're the love of my life, you're my ladyTumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen. Pour myself a cup of ambition. And yawnin', stretchin', try to come to life. Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'. Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'. With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5. Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'. Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'. They just use your mind and they never give you credit. It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it. 9 to 5, for service and devotion. You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion. Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me. I swear sometimes that man is out to get me. They let your dream, just watch 'em shatter. You're just a step on the boss man's ladder. But you got dreams he'll never take away. In the same boat with a lot of your friends. Waitin' for the day your ship 'll come in. And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll you away. Workin' 9 to 5 what a way to make a livin'. Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'. They just use your mind and you never get the credit. It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it. 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you. There's a better life and you think about it, don't you?. It's a rich man's game, no matter what they call it. And you spend your life putting money in his wallet.

May you never take one single breath for granted. God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed. I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean.

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance. Never settle for the path of least resistance. Living might mean taking chances but they're worth taking. Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth making. Don't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter. When you come close to selling out reconsider. Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance. And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance. I hope you dance. (Time is a wheel in constant motion always). I hope you dance. (Rolling us along). I hope you dance. (Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder). I hope you dance. (Where those years have gone).

And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance. Dance. I hope you dance. (Dance). I hope you dance. (Time is a wheel in constant motion always). I hope you dance. (Rolling us along). I hope you dance. (Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder). I hope you dance. (Where those years have gone). Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder. (Dance).

I'll bet she's beautiful. That girl he talks about. And she's got everything. That I have to live without. Drew talks to me. I laugh 'cause it's damn funny. But I can't even see. Anyone when he's with me. He says he's so in love. He's finally got it right. I wonder if he knows. He's all I think about at night. He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar. The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star. He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do. Drew walks by me. Can he tell that I can't breathe?. And there he goes, so perfectly. The kind of flawless I wish I could be. She better hold him tight. Give him all her love. Look in those beautiful eyes. And know she's lucky 'cause. He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar. The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star. He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do. So I drive home alone. As I turn out the light. I'll put his picture down. And maybe get some sleep tonight. 'Cuz he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar. The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart. He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do. He's the time taken up but there's never enough. And he's all that I need to fall into. Drew looks at me. I fake a smile so he won't seeI was ridin' shotgun. With my hair undone. In the front seat of his car. He's got a one-hand feel. On the steering wheel. The other on my heart. I look around. Turn the radio down. He says. "Baby, is somethin' wrong?. I say. "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song". And he says. Our song is the slammin' screen door. Sneakin' out late. Tappin' on your window. When we're on the phone. And you talk real slow. 'Cause it's late. And your mama don't know. Our song is the way you laugh. The first date. "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have". And when I got home. 'fore I said "Amen". Askin' God if he. Could play it again. I was walkin' up. The front porch steps. After everything that day. Had gone all wrong. Or been trampled on. And lost. And thrown away. Got to the hallway. Well on my way. To my lovin' bed. I almost didn't notice. All the roses. And the note that said. Our song is the slammin' screen door. Sneakin' out late. Tappin' on your window. When we're on the phone. And you talk real slow. 'Cause it's late. And your mama don't know. Our song is the way you laugh. The first date. "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have". And when I got home. 'fore I said "Amen". Askin' God if he could play it again. I've heard every album. Listened to the radio. Waited for something. To come along. That was as good as our song. 'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door. Sneakin' out late. Tappin' on his window. When we're on the phone. And he talks real slow. 'Cause it's late. And his mama don't know. Our song is the way he laughs. The first date. "Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have". And when I got home. before I said "Amen". Askin' God if he. Could play it again. Play it again. I was ridin' shotgun. With my hair undone. In the front seat of his car. I grabbed a pen. And an old napkin. And I wrote down our songWe were both young when I first saw you. I close my eyes & the flashback starts. I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air. See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns. See you make your way through the crowd. And say "Hello", little did I know.... That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles. And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet". And I was crying on the staircase. Begging you "Please don't go", & I said.... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run. You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". So I sneak out to the garden to see you. We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew. So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while. 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter. And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet". But you were everything to me. I was begging you "Please don't go", & I said.... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run. You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel. This love is difficult but it's real. Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". .... I got tired of waiting. Wondering if you were ever coming around. My faith in you was fading. When I met you on the outskirts of town. And I said.... Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone. I keep waiting for you but you never come. Is this in my head? I don't know what to think. He knelt to the ground & pulled out a ring & said. Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone. I love you & that's all I really know. I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". Oh oh oh. 'Cause we were both young when I first saw youYou're on the phone with your girlfriend—she's upset. She's going off about something that you said. 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.. I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.. I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.. And she'll never know your story like I do. But she wears short skirts. I wear t-shirt¶. She's cheer captain¶. And I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find. That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.. If you could see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So, why can't you see. You belong with me. You belong with me?. Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans. I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.. Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself. "Hey, isn't this easy?". And you've got a smile. That can light up this whole town. I haven't seen it in awhile. Since she brought you down.. You say you're fine—I know you better than that. Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?. She wears high heels. I wear sneakers. She's cheer captain¶. And I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find. That what you're looking for has been here the whole time. If you could see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So, why can't you see. You belong with me?. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.. All this time how could you not know, baby?. You belong with me. You belong with me. Oh, I remember you driving to my house. In the middle of the night. I'm the one who makes you laugh. When you know you're 'bout to cry. I know your favorite songs. And you tell me about your dreams. Think I know where you belong. Think I know it's with me. Can't you se that I'm the one. Who understands you?. Been here all along. So, why can't you see. You belong with me?. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.. All this time how could you not know, baby?. You belong with me. You belong with me. You belong with me. Have you ever thought just maybe. You belong with me?. You belong with mePicture perfect memories. Scattered all around the floor. Reaching for the phone 'cause. I can't fight it anymore. And I wonder if I. Ever cross your mind. For me it happens all the time. It's a quarter after one. I'm all alone. And I need you now. Said I wouldn't call. But I've lost all control. And I need you now. And I don't know how. I can do without. I just need you now. Another shot of whiskey. Can't stop looking at the door. Wishing you'd come sweeping. In the way you did before. And I wonder if I. Ever cross your mind. For me it happens all the time. It's a quarter after one. I'm a little drunk. And I need you now. Said I wouldn't call. But I've lost all control. And I need you now. And I don't know how. I can do without. I just need you now. Whoa, whoa. Guess I'd rather hurt. Than feel nothing at all. It's a quarter after one. I'm all alone. And I need you now. And I said I wouldn't call. But I'm a little drunk. And I need you now. And I don't know how. I can do without. I just need you now. I just need you now. Oh baby, I need you nowYou were in college working part-time, waiting tables. Left a small town, never looked back. I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling. Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts. I say, can you believe it?. As we're lying on the couch. The moment I can see it. Yes, yes. I can see it now. Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?. You put your arm around me for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine. Flash forward & we're taking on the world together. And there's a drawer of my things at your place. You learn my secrets & you figure out why I'm guarded. You say we'll never make my parent's mistakes. But we got bills to pay. We got nothing figured out. When it was hard to take. Yes, yes. This is what I thought about. Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?. You put your arm around me for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine. Do you remember all the city lights on the water?. You saw me start to believe for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine. And I remember that fight, 2: 30 AM. As everything was slipping right out of our hands. I ran out crying & you followed me out into the street. Braced myself for the goodbye. 'Cause that's all I've ever known. Then you took me by surprise. You said I'll never leave you alone. You said. I remember how we felt sitting by the water. And every time I look at you, it's like the first time. I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter. She is the best thing that's ever been mine. Hold on, make it last. Hold on, never turn back. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine. Do you believe it?. We're gonna make it now. And I can see it. I can see it nowAbsolutely no one who knows me better. No one that can make me feel so good. How did we stay so long together?. Everybody, everybody said we never would. And just when I. Start to think they're right. The love has died. There you go making my heart beat again. Heart beat again, heart beat again. There you go making me feel like a kid. Won't you do it, do it one time?. There you go pulling me right back in. Right back in, right back in. And I know I'm never letting this go. I'm stuck on you. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue. You and me baby, we're stuck like glue. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue. You and me baby, we're stuck like glue. Some days I don't feel like trying. Some days you know I wanna just give up. When it doesn't matter who's right. Fight about it all night. Had enough, you give me that look. I'm sorry baby let's make up. You do that thing that makes me laugh. And just like that. There you go making my heart beat again. Heart beat again, heart beat again. There you go making me feel like a kid. Won't you do it, do it one time?. There you go pulling me right back in. Right back in, right back in. And I know I'm never letting this go. I'm stuck on you. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue. You and me baby, we're stuck like glue. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue. You and me baby, we're stuck like glue. Â . Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, you almost stay out. Two stuck together from the ATL out. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, feelin' kinda sick. Just a spoon full of sugar make it better real quick. I say, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whatcha gonna do with that?. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, come on over here with that. Sugar sticky sweet stuff, come and give me that stuff. Everybody want some. Melodies that get stuck up in your head. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, up in your head. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, up in your head. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, up in your head. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh. Stuck like glue. You and me together, say it's all I wanna do. I said there you go making my heart beat again. Heart beat again, heart beat again. There you go making me feel like a kid. Won't you do it, do it one time?. There you go pulling me right back in. Right back in, right back in. And I know I'm never letting this go. There you go making my heart beat again. Heart beat again, heart beat again. There you go making me feel like a kid. Won't you do it, do it one time?. There you go pulling me right back in. Right back in, right back in. And I know I'm never letting this go. I'm stuck on you. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue. You and me baby, we're stuck like glue. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue. You and me baby, we're stuck like glue. Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue. You and me baby, we're stuck like glueI'm so glad you made time to see me. How's life, tell me how's your family. I haven't seen them in a while. You've been good, busier then ever. We small talk, work and the weather. Your guard is up and I know why. 'Cause the last time you saw me. Is still burned in the back of your mind. You gave me roses and I left them there to die. So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night. And I'd go back to December all the time. It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right. I'd go back to December all the time. These days I haven't been sleeping. Staying up playing back myself leaving. When your birthday passed and I didn't call. And I think about summer, all the beautiful times. I watched you laughing from the passenger side and. Realized I loved you in the fall. And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind. You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye. So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night. And I'd go back to December all the time. It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind. I'd go back to December all the time. I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right. And how you held me in your arms that September night. The first time you ever saw me cry. Maybe this is wishful thinking. Probably mindless dreaming. If we loved again I swear I'd love you right. I'd go back in time and change it but I can't. So if the chain is on your door, I understand. But this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night. And I'd go back to December. It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright. I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind. I'd go back to December all the time. All the timeIf I die young bury me in satin. Lay me down on a bed of roses. Sink me in the river at dawn. Send me away with the words of a love song. Uh oh uh oh. Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother. She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colours, oh and. Life ain't always what you think it oughta be, no. Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby. The sharp knife of a short life well. I've had just enough time. If I die young bury me in satin. Lay me down on a bed of roses. Sink me in the river at dawn. Send me away with the words of a love song. The sharp knife of a short life well. I've had just enough time. And I'll be wearing white, when I come into your kingdom. I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger, I've never known the lovin' of a man,. But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand. There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever. Who would have thought forever could be severed by. The sharp knife of a short life well. I've had just enough time. So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls. What I never did is done. A penny for my thoughts, oh no I'll sell them for a dollar. They're worth so much more after I'm a goner. And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singing. Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'. If I die young bury me in satin. Lay me down on a bed of roses. Sink me in the river at dawn. Send me away with the words of a love song. Uh oh (uh oh). The ballad of a dove. Go with peace and love. Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket. Save 'em for a time when your really gonna need 'em oh. The sharp knife of a short life well. I've had just enough time. So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearlsLying here with you so close to me. It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe. I'm caught up in this moment. Caught up in your smile. I've never opened up to anyone. So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms. But we don't need to rush this. Let's just take it slow. Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight. Just a touch of the fire burning so bright. No I don't want to mess this thing up. I don't want to push too far. Just a shot in the dark that you just might. Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life. So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight. I know that if we give this a little time. It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find. It's never felt so real,. No, it's never felt so right. Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight. Just a touch of the fire burning so bright. No I don't want to mess this thing up. I don't want to push too far. Just a shot in the dark that you just might. Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life. So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight. No, I don't want to say goodnight. I know it's time to leave, but you'll be in my dreams. Tonight, tonight, tonight. Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight. Just a touch of the fire burning so bright. No I don't want to mess this thing up. I don't want to push too far. Just a shot in the dark that you just might. Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life. So baby I'm alright, oh, let's do this right. With just a kiss goodnight. With a kiss goodnight, kiss goodnightYeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road,. Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.. Smoke rollin' out the window,. An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.. Memory lane up in the headlights,. It's got me reminiscing on them good times.. I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,. I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.. Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go.. Load the truck up, hit the dirt road.. Jump the barbwire, spread the word.. Light the bonfire, then call the girls.. The king in the can and the Marlboro man.. Jack'n'Jim were a few good men.. Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too.. Better watch out for the boys in blue.. And all this small town he said, she said,. Ain't it funny how rumors spread.. Like I know something ya'll don't know,. Man that talk is gettin' old.. Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth,. Before I have to knock that loud mouth out.. Im tired of talkin, man, ya'll ain't listenin',. Them old dirt roads is what ya'll missin'.. I'm chillin' on a dirt road.. Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.. Smoke rollin' out the window,. An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.. Memory lane up in the headlights,. It's got me reminiscing on them good times.. I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,. I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.. I sit back and think about them good ole days.. The way we were raised, and our southern ways,. And we like cornbread, and biscuits,. And if it's broke round here we fix it.. I can take ya'll where ya need to go,. Down to my hood, back in them woods.. We do it different 'round here, that's right,. But we sure do it good, and we do it all night.. See, if you really wanna know how it feels,. To get off the road with trucks and four wheels,. Jump on in, and man, tell your friends,. We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends.. I'm chillin' on a dirt road.. Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.. Smoke rollin' out the window,. An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.. Memory lane up in the headlights,. It's got me reminiscing on them good times.. I'm turning off of real life, driving that's right,. I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.. Thats right.. Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road.. Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.. Smoke rollin' out the window,. An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.. Memory lane up in the headlights,. It's got me reminiscing on them good times.. I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,. I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.. Thats right.I remember when we broke up the first time. Saying, "This is it, I've had enough" 'cause like. We hadn't seen each other in a month. When you said you needed space (What?). Then you come around again and say, "Baby. I miss you, and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me". Remember how that lasted for a day?. I say, "I hate you" We break up, you call me, "I love you". Ooh, we called it off again last night, but ooh. This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you. We are never, ever, ever getting back together. We are never, ever, ever getting back together. You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me. But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together. Like, ever. I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me. Falling for it screaming that I'm right and you. Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some. Indie record that's much cooler than mine. Ooh, you called me up again tonight, but ooh. This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you. We are never, ever, ever getting back together. We are never, ever, ever getting back together. You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me). But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together. I used to think that we were forever ever. And I used to say, "Never say never". Uh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you". I'm like, "I just, I mean this is exhausting. You know, like we are never getting back together". "Like, ever" (No!). We are never, ever, ever getting back together. We are never, ever, ever getting back together. You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me. But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together. We – getting back together. We – getting back together. You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me). But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back togetherNow, red solo cup is the best receptical. For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals. And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicals. If you prefer drinkin' from glass. Hey, red solo cup is cheap and disposable. And in fourteen years, they are decomposable. And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable.

Now, I really love how you're easy to stack. But I really hate how you're easy to crack. 'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack. Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky. But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten. Admirin' at how sharply my first name is written. On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'. On them to help me get lucky. Red solo cup.

You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic. And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic. When I look at you and say. Red solo cup, you're not just a cup. (No! No! No! God, no!). You're my-you're my (Friend?) friend. (Friend, friend, friend, Life-long). Thank you for being my friend. Red solo cup. I fill you up. Let's have a party. Let's have a party.

I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that. And when I fell hard, you took a step back. Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e-ee. And he's long gone when he's next to me. And I realize the blame is on me. 'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in. So shame on me now. Flew me to places I'd never been. So you put me down, oh. I knew you were trouble when you walked in. So shame on me now. Flew me to places I'd never been. Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground. Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble. Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble. No apologies, he'll never see you cry. Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why. You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing. And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street. A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be. Now I see, now I see, now I see-e-e-e-e-ee. He was long gone when he met me. And I realize the joke is on me, hey!. I knew you were trouble when you walked in, ohh. So shame on me now. Flew me to places I'd never been. So you put me down, oh. I knew you were trouble when you walked in. So shame on me now. Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah. Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground. Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble.

I knew you were trouble when you walked in. Trouble, trouble, troubleBaby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise. Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her. She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water. Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs". Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said. Baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise. Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle. Every little farm town with you. In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit. Would look a hell lot better with you up in it. So baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise. She was sippin' on southern and singin' Marshall Tucker. We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer. She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said. "Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck". Baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise. Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle. Every little farm town with you. In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit. Would look a hell lot better with you up in it. So baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise. When that summer sun fell to its knees. I looked at her and she looked at me. And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night. 'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right. I put it in park and. Grabbed my guitar. And strummed a couple chords. And sang from the heart. Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'. Hell I can't get you out of my head. Baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise. Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle. Every little farm town with you. Baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise. Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle. Every little farm town with you. In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit. Would look a hell lot better with you up in it. Come on. Baby you a song. You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise. Come on girl. Get those windows down and cruise. Aww yeah
