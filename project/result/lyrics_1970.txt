A poor little baby child is born. In the ghetto. And his mama cries. 'cause if there's one thing that she don't need. It's another hungry mouth to feed. In the ghetto. People, don't you understand. The child needs a helping hand. Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day. Take a look at you and me. Are we too blind to see. Do we simply turn our heads. And look the other way. Well the world turns. And a hungry little boy with a runny nose. Plays in the street as the cold wind blows. In the ghetto. And his hunger burns. So he starts to roam the streets at night. And he learns how to steal. And he learns how to fight. In the ghetto. Then one night in desperation. The young man breaks away. He buys a gun, steals a car. Tries to run, but he don't get far. And his mama cries. As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man. Face down on the street with a gun in his hand. In the ghetto. As her young man dies. On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'. Another little baby child is born. In the ghetto. And his mama criesStanding in the dock at Southampton. Trying to get to Holland or France. The man in the mac said. "You've got to go back". You know, they didn't even give us a chance. Christ, you know it ain't easy. You know how hard it can be. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify me. Finally made the plane into Paris. Honeymooning down by the Seine. Peter Brown called to say. You can make it okay. You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain. Christ, you know it ain't easy. You know how hard it can be. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify me. So from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton. Talking in our beds for a week. The news people said. "Say, what you doing in bed?". I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace". Christ, you know it ain't easy. You know how hard it can be. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify me. Saving up your money for a rainy day. Giving all your clothes to charity. Last night the wife said. Oh boy, when you're dead. You don't take nothing with you but your soul. Think!. Made a lightning trip to Vienna. Eating chocolate cake in a bag. Newspapers said. "She's gone to his head. They look just like two gurus in drag". Christ, you know it ain't easy. You know how hard it can be. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify me. Caught the early plane back to London. Fifty acorns tied in a sack. The men from the press. Said, "We wish you success. It's good to have the both of you back". Christ, you know it ain't easy. You know how hard it can be. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify me. The way things are going. They're gonna to crucify meLeft a good job in the city. Workin' for the man every night and day. And I never lost one minute of sleepin'. Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been. Big wheel keep on turnin'. Proud Mary keep on burnin'. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis. Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans. But I never saw the good side of the city. 'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen. Big wheel keep on turnin'. Proud Mary keep on burnin'. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. If you come down to the river. Bet you gonna find some people who live. You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money. People on the river are happy to give. Big wheel keep on turnin'. Proud Mary keep on burnin'. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river. Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the riverSomething in the way she moves. Attracts me like no other lover. Something in the way she woos me. I don't want to leave her now. You know I believe and how. Somewhere in her smile she knows. That I don't need no other lover. Something in her style that shows me. I don't want to leave her now. You know I believe and how. You're asking me, will my love grow?. I don't know, I don't know. You stick around now it may show. I don't know, I don't know.

That from her western shores. Those beautiful sailors journeyed. To the South and the North Americas with ease. In their ships with painted sails. To the East, Africa was a neighbour. Across a short strait of sea miles. The great Egyptian age is but a remnant. Of The Atlantian culture. The antediluvian kings colonised the world. All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas. In all legends, from all lands, were from far Atlantis. Knowing her fate. Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth. On board were the Twelve. The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician. And the other so-called Gods of our legends. Though Gods they were. And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind. Let us rejoice, and let us sing, and dance. And ring in the new. Hail, Atlantis!. Way down below the ocean. Where I wanna be, she may be. Way down below the ocean. Where I wanna be, she may be.

Oh, if I'd only seen, oh yeah, that the joke was one me, oh, no. That the joke was one me, ohI am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told. I've squandered my resistance. For a pocketful of mumbles. Such are promises. All lies and jest. Still the man hears what he wants to hear. And disregards the rest. When I left my home and my family. I was no more than a boy. In the company of strangers. In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared. Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters. Where the ragged people go. Looking for the places only they would know. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. La la la la, li. Asking only workman's wages. I come lookin' for a job but I get no offers. Just a come on from the whores on Seventh Avenue. I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome. I took some comfort there. La la la la la la la. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. La la la la, li. And I'm laying out my winter clothes. And wishing I was gone, goin' home. Where the New York City winters aren't bleedin' me. Leadin' me goin' home. In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade. And he carries the reminders. Of every glove that laid him down or cut him. 'Til he cried out in his anger and his shame. I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li. La la la la, li. Li la la la, li la li. Li la li. Li la la la, li la li.

But if you love him, you'll forgive him. Even though he's hard to understand. And if you love him, oh be proud of him. 'Cause after all, he's just a man. Stand by your man. Give him two arms to cling to. And something warm to come to. When nights are cold and lonely. Stand by your man. And show the world you love him. Keep giving all the love you can. Stand by your man. Stand by your man. And show the world you love him. Keep giving all the love you can. Stand by your manThe road is long. With many a winding turn. That leads us to who knows where. Who knows where. But I'm strong. Strong enough to carry him. He ain't heavy, he's my brother. So on we go. His welfare is of my concern. No burden is he to bear. We'll get there. For I know. He would not encumber me. He ain't heavy, he's my brother. If I'm laden at all. I'm laden with sadness. That everyone's heart. Isn't filled with the gladness. Of love for one another. It's a long, long road. From which there is no return. While we're on the way to there. Why not share. And the load. Doesn't weigh me down at all. He ain't heavy he's my brother. He's my brother. He ain't heavy, he's my brother. He ain't heavy, he's my brotherIt's the time of the season. When love runs high. In this time, give it to me easy. And let me try. With pleasured hands. To take you in the sun to. Promised lands. To show you every one. It's the time of the season for loving.... What's your name?. Who's your daddy?. Is he rich like me?. Has he taken any time. To show you what you need to live?. Tell it to me slowly. Tell you what I really want to know. It's the time of the season for loving.... What's your name?. Who's your daddy?. Is he rich like me?.

I chose you for the one. Now we're having so much fun. You treated me so kind. I'm about to lose my mind. You made me so very happy. I'm so glad you came into my life. The others were untrue. But when it came to loving you. I'd spend my whole life with you. 'Cause you came and you took control. You touched my very soul. You always showed me that. Loving you is where it's at. You made me so very happy. I'm so glad you came into my life. Thank you baby, yeah, yeah. I love you so much you see. You're even in my dreams, I can hear you. Baby, I can hear you callin' me. I'm so in love with you. All I ever want to do is. Thank you baby, thank you baby. You made me so very happy. I'm so glad you came into my life. You made me so very happy. You made me so, so very happy baby. I'm so glad you came into my life. I want to thank you, girl. Every day of my life, I want to thank you. You made me so very happy. That I wanna spend my life thanking you. Thank you baby, thank you baby. Thank you baby, thank you babyWell, my daddy left home when I was three. And he didn't leave much to ma and me. Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze. Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid. But the meanest thing that he ever did. Was before he left, he went and named me Sue. Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke. And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk. It seems I had to fight my whole life through. Some gal would giggle and I'd get red. And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head. I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue. Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean. My fist got hard and my wits got keen. I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame. But I made me a vow to the moon and stars. That I'd search the honky tonks and bars. And kill that man who gave me that awful name. Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid July. And I just hit town and my throat was dry. I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew. At an old saloon on a street of mud. There at a table, dealing stud. Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue. Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad. From a worn out picture that my mother had. And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye. He was big and bent and gray and old. And I looked at him and my blood ran cold. And I said, "My name is Sue! How do you do?. Now you're gonna die". Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes. And he went down, but to my surprise. He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair right across his teeth. And we crashed through the wall and into the street. Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer. I tell ya, I've fought tougher men. But I really can't remember when. He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile. I heard him laugh and then I heard him curse. He went for his gun and I pulled mine first. He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile. And he said, "Son, this world is rough. And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough. And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along. So I give you that name and I said goodbye. I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's the name that helped to make you strong". He said, "Now you just fought one hell of a fight. And I know you hate me, and you got the right. To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do. But you ought to thank me, before I die. For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye. 'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue. What could I do? Yeah what could I do?. I got all choked up and I threw down my gun. And I called him my pa, and he called me his son. And I came away with a different point of view. And I think about him, now and then. Every time I try and every time I win. And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him. Bill or George anything but Sue I still hate that nameAll my bags are packed, I'm ready to go. I'm standing here outside your door. I hate to wake you up to say goodbye. But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn. Taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn. Already I'm so lonesome I could cry. So kiss me and smile for me. Tell me that you'll wait for me. Hold me like you'll never let me go. I'm leavin' on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Oh babe, I hate to go. There's so many times I've let you down. So many times I've played around. I tell you now, they don't mean a thing. Every place I go, I think of you. Every song I sing, I sing for you. When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring. So kiss me and smile for me. Tell me that you'll wait for me. Hold me like you'll never let me go. I'm leavin' on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Oh babe, I hate to go. Now the time has come to leave you. One more time let me kiss you. Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way. Dream about the days to come. When I won't have to leave alone. About the time, I won't have to say. Kiss me and smile for me. Tell me that you'll wait for me. Hold me like you'll never let me go. I'm leavin' on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Leavin' on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Leavin' on a jet plane. I don't know when I'll be back again. Oh babe, I hate to goYou talk like Marlène Dietrich. And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire. Your clothes are all made by Balmain. And there's diamonds and pearls in your hair, yes there are. You live in a fancy apartment. Off the Boulevard Saint-Michel. Where you keep your Rolling Stones records. And a friend of Sacha Distel, yes you do. But where do you go to my lovely. When you're alone in your bed. Tell me the thoughts that surround you. I want to look inside your head, yes I do. I've seen all your qualifications. You got from the Sorbonne. And the painting you stole from Picasso. Your loveliness goes on and on, yes it does. When you go on your summer vacation you go to Juan-les-Pins. With your carefully designed topless swimsuit. You get an even sun tan, on your back and on your legs. When the snow falls you're found in Saint Moritz. With the others of the jet-set. And you sip your Napoleon brandy. But you never get your lips wet, no you don't. But where do you go to my lovely. When you're alone in your bed. Won't you tell me the thoughts that surround you. I want to look inside your head, yes I do. Your name, it is heard in high places. You know the Aga Khan. He sent you a racehorse for Christmas. And you keep it just for fun, for a laugh ahaha. They say that when you get married. It'll be to a millionaire. But they don't realise where you came from. And I wonder if they really care or give a damn. Where do you go to my lovely. When you're alone in your bed. Tell me the thoughts that surround you. I want to look inside your head, yes I do. I remember the back streets of Naples. Two children begging in rags. Both touched with a burning ambition. To shake off their lowly born tags, and they try. So look into my face, Marie-Claire. And remember just who you are. Then go and forget me forever. But I know you still bear the scar deep inside, yes you do. I know where you go to my lovely. When you're alone in your bed. I know the thoughts that surround you. Cause I can look inside your headPlease don't make me wait too late tomorrow comes. And I will not be late. Late to day when it becomes tomorrow I will. Leave to go a-way. Goodbye... Goodbye.... Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye. Songs that lingered on my lips excite me now. And linger on my mind. Leave your flowers at my door I'll leave them for. The one who waits behind. Goodbye... Goodbye.... Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye. Far away my lover sings a lonely song. And calls me to her side. When a song of lonely love invites me on. I must go to her side. Goodbye... Goodbye.... Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, GoodbyeAnd now the end is near. And so I face the final curtain. My friend, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case of which I'm certain. I've lived a life that's full. I've travelled each and every highway. and more, much more than this. I did it my way. Regrets I've had a few. But then again too few to mention. I did what I had to do. And saw it through without exemption. I planned each chartered course. Each careful step along the by-way. And more, much more than this. I did it my way. Yes, there were times. I'm sure you knew. When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all when there was doubt. I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all. And I stood tall. And did it my way. I've loved, I've laughed, and cried. I've had my fill, my share of losing. And now, as tears subside. I find it all so amusing. To think I did all that. And may I say, not in a shy way. "Oh no, oh no, not me. I did it my way". For what is a man, what has he got?. If not himself then he has naught. To say the things he truly feels. And not the words of one who kneels. The record shows I took the blows. And did it my way. Yes, it was my waySome folks are born made to wave the flag. ooo, they're red, white and blue. And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief". ooo, they point the cannon at you, Lord. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no senator's son, no. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no fortunate one, no. Some folks are born silver spoon in hand. Lord, don't they help themselves, yeah. But when the taxman comes to the door. Lord, the house look a like a rummage sale, yeah. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no millionaire's son, no, no. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no fortunate one, no. (Guitar). Yeah, some folks inherit star-spangled eyes. ooo, they send you down to war, Lord. And when you ask 'em how much should we give. ooo, they only answer; more, more, more yeah. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no military son, son, no no. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no fortunate one, one. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no fortunate one, no, no, no. It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no fortunate son, no, no, noHold it, everybody. Hold it, hold it, listen. I can turn the gray sky blue. I can make it rain whenever I want it to. Oh, I can build a castle from a single grain of sand. I can make a ship sail, huh, on dry land. But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue. 'Cause I can't get next to you. Next to you. I just can't get next you. I can fly like a bird in the sky. Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy. Oh, I can turn a river into a raging fire. I can live forever if I so desire. Unimportant are all the things I can do. 'Cause I can't get next to you. No matter what I do. Uh-yah. Ooh. Ooh. Chicka boom, chicka boom. Chicka boom, boom, boom. I can turn back the hands of time.

Never saying what they mean. And they wile away the hours. In their ivory towers. Till they're covered up with flowers. In the back of a black limousine. Chorus. La-da da da da da da da. La-da da da da da de. Talking 'bout you and me. And the games people play. Oh we make one another cry. Break a heart then we say goodbye. Cross our hearts and we hope to die. That the other was to blame. Neither one ever will give in. So we gaze at our eight by ten. Thinking 'bout the things that might have been. It's a dirty rotten shame. Repeat Chorus. People walking up to you. Singing glory hallelulia. And they're tryin to sock it to you. In the name of the Lord. They're gonna teach you how to meditate. Read your horoscope, cheat your faith. And further more to hell with hate. Come on and get on board. Repeat Chorus. Look around tell me what you see. What's happening to you and me. God grant me the serenity. To remember who I am. Cause you've given up your sanity. For your pride and your vanity. Turned your back on humanity. And you don't give a da da da da da. Repeat ChorusSir Douglas Quintet is back. We'd like to thank all our beautiful friends all over the country. And all the beautiful vibrations. We love you. Teeny bopper, My teenage lover. I caught your waves last night. It set my mind a wond' rin'. You're such a groove, please don't move. Please stay in my love house by the river. Fast talkin' guys with strange red eyes. Have put things in your head. It set my mind a wond' rin'. I love you so, please don't go. Please stay here with me in Mendocino. Mendocino, Mendocino. Where life's such a groove. You blow your mind in the morning. We used to walk through the park. Make love along the way in Mendocino. Like I told you. Can you, dig it?. If you want to groove I'll be glad to have you. I Love you so. Please don't go. Please stay here with me in Mendocino{melody}. . Love is but a song we sing, fear's the way we die.. You can make the mountains ring or make the angels cry.. Though the bird is on the wing and you may not know why…. . Come on people now, smile on your brother,. Everybody get together…try to love one another right now.. . Some may come and some may go, we will surely pass. When the one that left us here returns for us at last.. We are but a moment's sunlight fading in the grass.. . Come on people now, smile on your brother. Everybody get together …try to love one another right now.. . Come on people now Smile on your brother. Everybody get together…try to love one another right now.. . {solo verse}. . Come on people now, smile on your brother,. Everybody get together…try to love one another right now.. . {melody}. . If you hear the song I sing you will understand.. You hold the key to love and fear…all in your tremblin’ hand.. Just one key unlocks them both, it's there at your command.. . Come on people now, smile on your brother,. Everybody get together…try to love one another right now.. . Come on people now, smile on your brother,. Everybody get together…try to love one another right now.. . Come on people now, smile on your brother,. Everybody get together…try to love one another. Right now…right now…right now….Jean.

When the sun comes a-singin' I'll still be waitin'. For Jean, Jean, roses are red. And all of the leaves have gone green. While the hills are ablaze with the moon's yellow haze. Come into my arms, bonnie Jean. (Jean, Jean). Jean, you're young and alive!. Come out of your half-dreamed dream. And run, if you will to the top of the hill. Come into my arms, bonnie Jean. Jean.

Don't ask me why but time has passed us by. Someone else moved in from far away. Now we are tall and Christmas trees are small. And you don't ask the time of day. But you and I, our love will never die. But guess we'll cry come first of May. The apple tree that grew for you and me. I watched the apples falling one by one. And I recall the moment of them all.

Plays by intuition. The digit counters fall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. He's a pinball wizard. There has to be a twist. A pinball wizard's. Got such a supple wrist. How do you think he does it? I don't know. What makes him so good?. Ain't got no distractions. Can't hear no buzzers and bells. Don't see no lights a flashing. Plays by sense of smell. Always gets a replay. Never see him fall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid. Sure plays a mean pinball. I thought I was the bally table king. But I just handed my pinball crown to him. Even on my favorite table. He can beat my best. His disciples lead him in. And he just does the rest. He's got crazy flipper fingers. Never seen him fall. That deaf, dumb and blind kind. Sure plays a mean pinballIt's your thing. Do what you wanna do. I can't tell you. Who to sock it to. It's your thing. Do what you wanna do now. I can't tell you. Who to sock it to.

C-O-L-A, Cola. She walked up to me and she asked me to dance. I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola. L-O-L-A, Lola. La-la-la-la Lola. Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy. But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine, oh my Lola. La-la-la-la Lola. Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand. Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man, oh my Lola. La-la-la-la Lola. La-la-la-la Lola. Well, we drank champagne and danced all night. Under electric candlelight. She picked me up and sat me on her knee. And said "Dear boy, won't you come home with me?". Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy. But when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my Lola. La-la-la-la Lola. La-la-la-la Lola. Lola. La-la-la-la Lola. La-la-la-la Lola. I pushed her away. I walked to the door. I fell to the floor. I got down on my knees. Then I looked at her and she at me. Well, that's the way that I want it to stay. And I always want it to be that way for my Lola. La-la-la-la Lola. Girls will be boys and boys will be girls. It's a mixed up, muddled up, sup world, except for Lola. La-la-la-la Lola. Well, I left home just a week before. And I'd never ever kissed a woman before. But Lola smiled and took me by the hand. And said "Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man". Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man. But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man. And so is Lola.

Nothin' seems to fit. Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'. So I just did me some talkin' to the sun. And I said I didn't like the way he got things done. Sleepin' on the job. Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'. But there's one thing I know. The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me. It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me. Raindrops keep fallin' on my head. But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red. Cryin's not for me. 'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'. Because I'm free. Nothin's worryin' me. It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me. Raindrops keep fallin' on my head. But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red. Cryin's not for me. 'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'. Because I'm free. Nothin's worryin' meThere's a place up ahead and I'm goin'. Just as fast as my feet can fly. Come away, come away if you're goin'. Leave the sinkin' ship behind. Come on the risin' wind. We're goin' up around the bend. Bring a song and a smile for the banjo. Better get while the gettin's good. Hitch a ride to the end of the highway. Where the neons turn to wood. Come on the risin' wind. We're goin' up around the bend. You can ponder perpetual motion. Fix your mind on a crystal day. Always time for good conversation. There's an ear for what you say. Come on the risin' wind. We're goin' up around the bend. Catch a ride to the end of the highway. And we'll meet by the big red tree. There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'. Come along, come along with me. Come on the risin' wind. We're goin' up around the bend. Do do do do. Do do do do.

It's only there tryin' to fool the public. But when it comes down to foolin' you. Now honey, that's quite a different subject. But don't let my glad expression. Give you the wrong impression. Really I'm sad, sadder than sad. You're gone and I'm hurtin' so bad. Like a clown, I pretend to be glad. Now there's some sad things known to man. But ain't too much sadder than. The tears of a clown. When there's no one around. Oh yeah baby. Now if I appear to be carefree. It's only to camouflage my sadness. In order to shield my pride I try. To cover this hurt with a show of gladness. But don't let my show convince you. That I've been happy since you. Decided to go, oh, I need you so. I'm hurt and I want you to know. But for others I put on a show. Ooh, oh there's some sad things known to man. But ain't too much sadder than. The tears of a clown. When there's no one around, oh yeah. Just like Pagliacci did. I try to keep my sadness hid, smiling in the public eye. But in my lonely room I cry the tears of a clown. When there's no one around. Oh yeah baby. Now if there's a smile on my face. Don't let my glad expression. Give you the wrong impression. Don't let this smile I wear. Make you think that I don't care. Really I'm sad, hurtin' so badNow that you're gone.

You took me from the shelter of my mother. I had never known or loved any other. We kissed after taking vows. But that night on our honeymoon. We stayed in separate rooms. I wait in the darkness of my lonely room. Filled with sadness, filled with gloom. Hoping soon. That you'll walk back through that door. And love me like you tried before. Since you've been gone.

(We've only begun). Before the risin' sun, we fly. So many roads to choose. We start out walkin' and learn to run. (And yes, we've just begun). Sharin' horizons that are new to us. Watchin' the signs along the way. Talkin' it over, just the two of us. Workin' together day to day, together. And when the evenin' comes, we smile. So much of life ahead. We'll find a place where there's room to grow. (And yes, we've just begun). Sharin' horizons that are new to us. Watchin' the signs along the way. Talkin' it over, just the two of us.

And yes, we've just begunFinished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind.. People think I'm insane, because I am frowning all the time.. All day long I think of things, but nothing seems to satisfy.. Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.. Can you help me occupy my brain?. Oh yeah.. I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find.. I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind.. Make a joke, and I will sigh, and you will laugh, and I will cry.. Happiness I cannot feel, and love to me is so unreal.. And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state.. I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late.Michael: A buh-buh buh buh-buh. J5: A buh-buh buh buh-buh. Michael: You went to school to learn, girl.

Susanne the plans they made put an end to you. I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song. I just can't remember who to send it to. I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end. I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend. But I always thought that I'd see you again. Won't you look down upon me, jesus. You've got to help me make a stand. You've just got to see me through another day. My body's aching and my time is at hand. And I won't make it any other way. Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end. I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend. But I always thought that I'd see you again. Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun. Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around. Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things. To come. Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground. Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end. I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend. But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now. Thought I'd see you one more time again. There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now.

And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain.. I went down Virginia seekin' shelter from the storm. Caught up in the fable I watched the tower grow. Five year plans and new deals wrapped in golden chains.. And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain.. Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more.. The crowd had rushed together tryin' to keep warm.. Still the rain kept pourin', fallin' on my ears. And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain.Poppy Family.

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl. I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day. When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest. in a big field of tall grass. I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face. And I fell asleep and dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie. And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind, the fact that me,. an overfed, long-haired leaping gnome. should be the star of a Hollywood movie. But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings. I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world. In front of every kind of girl, there was. black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones.... Out of the middle came a lady. She whispered in my ear something crazy. She said:. Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl. Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl. (spoken:). I thought to myself what could that mean. Am I going crazy or is this just a dream. Now, wait a minute. I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere. so it's all in my head. and then. I heard her say one more time:. (sung:). Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl. Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl. (spoken:). I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back. As she disappeared, but soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass. And raised it to her lips. And just before she drank it, she said:. (sung:). Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl. Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearlHey there lonely girl. Lonely girl.

(Get ready, 'cause here I come)(Spoken:). I was born and raised down in Alabama. On a farm way back up in the woods. I was so ragged the folks used to call me Patches. Papa used to tease me about it 'Course deep down inside. He was hurt 'cause he'd done all he could. My papa was a great old man. I can see him with a shovel in his hand. See, education he never had. He did wonders when the times got bad. The little money from the crops he raised. Barely paid the bills we made. Oh life had kicked him down to the ground. When he tried to get up life would kick him back down. One day papa called me to his dyin' bed. Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said. He said "Patches, I'm depending on you son,. To pull the family through,. My son, it's all left up to you". (Spoken:). Two days later papa passed away. And I became a man that day. So I told mama I was gonna quit school. But she said that was daddy's strictest rule. So every morning 'fore I went to school. I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too. Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on. I wanted to leave just run away from home. But I would remember what my daddy said. With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed. He said, "Patches, I'm depending on you son. I tried to do my best,. It's up to you to do the rest". (Spoken:). Then one day a strong rain came. And washed all the crops away. And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying. The weight of the whole world on my shoulders. And you know, mama knew what I was going through, 'cause. Everyday I had to work the fields. 'Cause that's the only way we got our meals. See, I was the oldest of the family. And everybody else depended on me. Every night I heard my mama pray. "Lord, give him strength to make another day". Though years have passed and all the kids are grown. The angels took mama to a brand new home. Lord knows people, I shed a tear. My daddy's voice helped me through the years. Sayin, "Patches, I'm depending on you son,. To pull the family through,. My son, it's all left up to you". Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin'. "Patches, I'm depending on you son,. I tried to do my best,. It's up to you to do the rest".. I could still hear papa when he's sayin'. "Patches, I'm depending on you son,. To pull the family through,. My son, it's all left up to you". (Fade)Stop! Na na na! You'd better save it. Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it. When we played tag in grade school. You wanted to be It. But chasing boys was just a fad. You crossed your heart you'd quit. When we grew up you traded. Your promise for my ring. Now just like back to grade school. You're doing the same old thing. Stop! The love you save may be your own. Darling, take it slow. Or some day you'll be all alone. You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own. Darling, look both ways before you cross me. You're headed for the danger zone. I'm the one who loves you. I'm the one you need. Those other guys will put you down. As soon as they succeed. They'll ruin your reputation. They'll label you a flirt. The way they talk about you. They'll turn your name to dirt, oh. Isaac said he kissed you. Beneath the apple tree. When Benjie held your hand he felt. Electricity. When Alexander called you. He said he rang your chimes. Christopher discovered. You're way ahead of your times. Stop! The love you save may be your own. Darling, take it slow. Or some day you'll be all alone. You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own. Darling, look both ways before you cross me. You're headed for a danger zone. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. S is for "Save it". T is for "Take it slow". O is for "Oh, no!". P is for "Please, please, don't go!". The love you save may be your own. Some day you may be all alone. Stop it. Save it, girl. Baby! Ooooh. You'd better stop! the love you save may be your own. Please, please. Or some day, some day baby, you'll be all alone. I'm the one who loves you. I'm the one you need. Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed. Ahh. Stop! The love you save may be your own, baby. You'd better stop it, stop it, stop it girl. Or someday you'll be all alone.

Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeedWhy do we never get an answer. When we're knocking at the door. With a thousand million questions. About hate and death and war. It's where we stop and look around us. There is nothing that we need. In a world of persecution. That is burning in it's greed. Why do we never get an answer. When we're knocking at the door. Because the truth is hard to swallow. That's what the wall of love is for. It's not the way that you say it. When you do those things to me. It's more the way that you mean it. When you tell me what will be. And when you stop and think about it. You won't believe it's true. That all the love you've been giving. Has all been meant for you. I'm looking for someone to change my life. I'm looking for a miracle in my life. And if you could see what it's done to me. Lose the the love I knew, could safely lead me through. Between the silence of the mountains. And the crashing of the sea. There lies a land I once lived in. And she's waiting there for me. But in the grey of the morning. My mind becomes confused. Between the dead and the sleeping. And the road that I must choose. I'm looking for someone to change my life. I'm looking for a miracle in my life. And if you could see what it's done to me. To lose the love I knew, could safely lead me to. The land that I once knew. To learn as we grow old the secrets of our souls. It's not the way that you say it. When you do those things to me. It's more the way you really mean it. When you tell me what will be. Why do we never get an answer. When we're knocking at the door?. With a thousand million questions. About hate and death and war. It's where we stop and look around us. There is nothing that we need. In a world of persecution. That is burning in it's greed. Why do we never get an answer. When we're knocking at the door?Lay down, lay down, lay it all down. Let your white birds smile. At the ones who stand and frown. Lay down, lay down, lay it all down. Let your white birds smile. At the ones who stand and frown. We were so close, there was no room. We bled inside each other's wounds. We all had caught the same disease. And we all sang the songs of peace. Lay down, lay down, lay it all down. Let your white birds smile. At the ones who stand and frown. Lay down, lay down, lay it all down. Let your white birds smile. At the ones who stand and frown. So raise candles high. 'Cause if you don't we could stay black against the night. Oh, raise them higher again. And if you do we could stay dry against the rain. Lay down, lay down, lay it all down. Let your white birds smile. At the ones who stand and frown. Lay down, lay down, lay it all down. Let your white birds smile. At the ones who stand and frown. We were so close, there was no room. We bled inside each other's wounds. We all had caught the same disease. And we all sang the songs of peace. Some came to sing, some came to pray. Some came to keep the dark away. So raise candles high. 'Cause if you don't we could stay black against the sky. Oh, oh, raise them higher again. And if you do we could stay dry against the rain. Lay down, lay down, lay it all down. Let your white birds smile. At the ones who stand and frown. Lay down, lay down, lay it all down. Let your white birds smile. At the ones who stand and frown. Lay down, lay down, lay it all down.

Maybe i'll find on the way down the line. That i'm free, free to be me.. Black night is a long way from home.. I don't need a dark tree. I don't want a rough sea. I can't feel, i can't see.. Maybe i'll find on the way down the line. That i'm free, free to be me.. Black night is a long way from home.. Black night, black night. I don't need black night. I can't see dark night.. Maybe i'll find on the way down the line. That i'm free, free to be me.. Black night is a long way from home.When no one else can understand me. When everything I do is wrong. You give me hope and consolation. You give me strength to carry on. And you're always there to lend a hand. In everything I do, that's the wonder. The wonder of you. And when you smile the world is brighter. You touch my hand and I'm a king. Your kiss to me is worth a fortune. Your love for me is everything. I'll guess I'll never know the reason why. You love me like you do, that's the wonder. The wonder of you. I'll guess I'll never know the reason why. You love me as you do, that's the wonder. The wonder of youToday I stumbled from my bed. With thunder crashing in my head. My pillow still wet. From last night tears. And as I think of giving up. A voice inside my coffee-cup. Kept crying out. And ringing in my ears. Don't cry daddy.

All my dreams turned to ashes and gone, oh yeah. As I looked at my life it was barren and bare. Without love I've had nothing at all. Without love I've had nothing. Without love I've had nothing at all. I have conquered the world. All but one thing did I have. Without love I've had nothing at all. Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me. There was nothing, oh that she would not give, oh no. But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see. That a heart without love cannot live. Without love I've had nothing.

That hypnotized me with love. She was a gypsy woman. She was a gypsy woman. She danced around and round to a guitar melody. From the fire her face was all aglow, how she enchanted me. Oh, how I'd like to hold her near. And kiss and forever whisper in her ear. I love you, gypsy woman. I love you, gypsy woman. All through the caravan, she was dancing with all the men. Waiting for the rising sun, everyone was having fun. I hate to see the lady go knowing she'll never know. That I love her, I love her. Gypsy woman. I love you, gypsy woman. I love you, gypsy woman. I love you, gypsy woman. I love you, gypsy womanOne less bell to answer. One less egg to fry. One less man to pick up after. I should be happy. But all I do is cry. (Cry, cry, no more laughter). I should be happy. (Oh, why did he go). Since he left my life's so empty. Though I try to forget it just can't be done. Each time the doorbell rings I still run. I don't know how in the world. To stop thinking of him. 'Cause I still love him so. I spend each day the way I start out. Crying my heart out. One less man to pick up after. No more laughter, no more love. Since he went away. (He went away, one less bell to answer). Why did he leave me?. (Why, why, why did he leave?). Now I've got one less egg to fry. (One less bell to answer). One less egg to fry.

I never promised you a rose garden. I could promise you things like big diamond rings. But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover. So you better think it over. Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true. I would give you the world right now on a silver platter. But what would it matter. So smile for a while and let's be jolly.

You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without. . All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand. But you turned into a lover and. Mother what a lover, you wore me out. All you did was wreck my bed. And in the morning kick me in the head. Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore. You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone. You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried. . I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school. Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool. Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand. Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face. You made a first class fool out of me. But I'm as blind as a fool can be.

Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair. It's just another day. Slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes. Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat. It's just another day. At the office where the papers grow she takes a break. Drinks another coffee and she finds it hard to stay awake. It's just another day. It's just another day. It's just another day. So sad, so sad, sometimes she feels so sad. Alone in her apartment she'd dwell. Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell. Stay, don't stand around and he comes and he stays. But he leaves the next day, so sad. Sometimes she feels so sad. As she posts another letter to the sound of five. People gather 'round her and she finds it hard to stay alive. It's just another day. It's just another day. It's just another day. So sad, so sad, sometimes she feels so sad. Alone in her apartment she'd dwell. Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell. Stay, don't stand around and he comes and he stays. But he leaves the next day, so sad. Sometimes she feels so sad. Everyday she takes a morning bath she wets her hair. Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair. It's just another day. Slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes. Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat. It's just another day.

Bang a gong. Get it on. Get it on. Bang a gong. Get it on, right on. Take me!. For a meanwhile I'm still thinking...There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold. And she's buying a stairway to heaven. When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed. With a word she can get what she came for. Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven. There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure. 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings. Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. Ooh, it makes me wonder. Ooh, it makes me wonder. There's a feeling I get when I look to the west. And my spirit is crying for leaving. In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees. And the voices of those who stand looking. Ooh, it makes me wonder. Ooh, it really makes me wonder. And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune. Then the piper will lead us to reason. And a new day will dawn for those who stand long. And the forests will echo with laughter. If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now. It's just a spring clean for the May queen. Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run. There's still time to change the road you're on. And it makes me wonder. Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know. The piper's calling you to join him. Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow and did you know. Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?. And as we wind on down the road. Our shadows taller than our soul. There walks a lady we all know. Who shines white light and wants to show. How everything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard. The tune will come to you at last. When all are one and one is all, yeah. To be a rock and not to roll. And she's buying a stairway to heavenIt don't come easy,. You know it don't come easy.. It don't come easy,. You know it don't come easy..

That I put down in words. How wonderful life is while you're in the world. I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss. Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross. But the sun's been quite kind. While I wrote this song. It's for people like you that keep it turned on. So excuse me forgetting. But these things I do.

To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true. Out of all the fellas in the world she belongs to me. But it was just my imagination. Runnin' away with me. It was just my imagination. Runnin' away with me. Soon, soon we'll be married and raise a family. A cozy, little home out in the country. With two children, maybe three. I tell you, I can visualize it all. This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems. But it was just my imagination, once again. Runnin' away with me. I tell you it was just my imagination. Runnin' away with me. Every night, on my knees I pray. "Dear Lord, hear my plea. Don't ever let another take her love from me. Or I will surely die". Her love is Heavenly. When her arms enfold me. I hear a tender rhapsody. But in reality, she doesn't even know me. Just my imagination, once again. Runnin' away with me. I tell you it was just my imagination. Runnin' away with me. I never met her, but I can't forget her. Just my imagination. Runnin' away with me. Just my imagination. Runnin' away with meTu me dis loin des yeux loin du coeur. Tu me dis qu'on oublie le meilleur.

Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently. By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee. Every time I look into the Holy Book I want to tremble (tremble). Or when I read about the part where the carpenter cleared the temple (temple). For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellas than what I profess to be. And it causes me shame to know we're not the people we should be. So, put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water. Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea. Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently. By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee. My mama taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven. She said, "there'll come a time when there'll probably be room in heaven". But I'm feeling kinda guilty 'bout the number of times to do what we must do. But we forget what he said, then we figure that he'll still make room. So, you gotta put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water. Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea. Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently. By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee. Everybody come along. Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water. (Who stilled the water). Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea. (Who calmed the sea). Take a look at yourself and you can look atLA's fine, the sun shines most of the time. The feeling is laid back. Palm trees grow and the rents are low. But you know I keep thinking about. Making my way back. Well, I'm New York City born and raised. But nowadays, I'm lost between two shores. LA's fine, but it ain't home. New York's home but it ain't mine no more. I am, I said. To no one there. And no one heard at all. Not even the chair. I am, I cried. I am, said I. And I am lost, and I can't even say why. Leavin' me lonely still. Did you ever read about a frog who dreamed of being a king. And then became one. Well, except for the names and a few other changes. If you talk about me, the story's the same one. But I got an emptiness deep inside. And I've tried but it won't let me go. And I'm not a man who likes to swear. But I've never cared for the sound of being alone. I am, I said. To no one there. And no one heard at all. Not even the chair. I am, I cried. I am, said I. And I am lost, and I can't even say why. I am, I said. I am, I cried. I am...Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

Preach a little gospel, sell a couple bottles of Doctor Good. Gypsys, tramps, and thieves. We'd hear it from the people of the town. They'd call us gypsys, tramps, and thieves. But every night all the men would come around. And lay their money down. Picked up a boy just south of Mobile. Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal. I was sixteen, he was twenty-one. Rode with us to Memphis. And Papa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done. Gypsys, tramps, and thieves. We'd hear it from the people of the town. They'd call us gypsys, tramps, and thieves. But every night all the men would come around. And lay their money down. I never had schoolin' but he taught me well. With his smooth southern style. Three months later I'm a girl in trouble.

And the morning we got caught. Robbing from an old hen. Old McDonald he made us work. But then he paid us for what it was worth. Another tank of gas. And back on the road again. I'll never forget the day. We motored stately into big L.A.. The lights of the city put settlin'. Down in my brain. Though it's only been a month or so. That old car's buggin' us to go. We've gotta get away and get back on. The road againMr. Big Stuff. Who do you think you are. Mr. Big Stuff. You're never gonna get my love. Now because you wear all those fancy clothes.

You're never gonna get my love. Now I know all the girls I've seen you with. I know you broke their hearts one after another now, bit by bit. You made 'em cry, many poor girls cry.

I'd rather give my love to a poor guy that has a love that's true. Than to be fooled around and get hurt by you. 'Cause when I give my love, I want love in return.

If a face could launch a thousand ships, then where am I to go?. there's no one home but you, You're all that's left me too.. And when, my love, for life is running dry,. you come, and pour, yourself, on me.. If a man could be two places at one time I'd be with you.. tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.. If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,. I'd spend the end with you, and when the world was through,. Then one, by one, the stars would all go out. and you, and I, would simply fly awayI won't laugh at you when you boo-hoo-hoo, cos' I love you. I can turn my back on the things you lack, cos' I love you. I just like the things you do (mmm). Don't you change the things you do (mmm).

Don't you change the things you do (mmm). Hey. When you bite your lip you're gonna flip your flip, but I love you. When we're miles apart you still reach my heart, how I love you. I just like the things you do (mmm). Don't you change the things you do (mmm). Only time can tell if we get on well cos' I love you. All that's passed us by we can only sighhihi cos' I love you.

He talked of life, he talked of life, he laughed, clicked his heels and stepped.. He said his name "Bojangles" and he danced a lick,. across the cell. He grabbed his pants and spread his stance,. Oh he jumped so high. and then he clicked his heels. He let go a laugh, let go a laugh,. sback his clothes all around. Mr. Bojangles. Mr. Bojangles.. Mr. Bojangles, Dance.

And after 20 years he still grieves.. He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks. for drinks and tips. But most the time I spend behind these county bars. 'cause I drinks a bit.

That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see. 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear. And grace my fears relieved. How precious did that grace appear. The hour I first believed. Through many dangers, toils and snares. We have already come. 'Twas grace hath brought us safe thus far. And grace will lead us home. When we've been there ten thousand years. Bright shining as the sun. We'd know less days to sing God's praise. Than when we first begun. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I seeBorriquito como tu. Tu-Ru-Ru. Que no sabes ni la U. Tu-Ru-Ru. Borriquito como tu. Tu-Ru-Ru. Yo se mas que tu.

But if you wanna leave, take good care. I hope you have a lot of nice things to wear. But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there. Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world. It's hard to get by just upon a smile. Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world. I'll always remember you like a child, girl. You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do. And it's breaking my heart in two. Because I never wanna see you a sad girl. Don't be a bad girl. But if you wanna leave, take good care. I hope you make a lot of nice friends out there.

I'll always remember you like a child, girlAnd the sign said, "Long-haired freaky people need not apply". So I tucked my hair up under my hat and I went in to ask him why. He said, "You look like a fine upstanding young man, I think you'll do". So I took off my hat, I said, "Imagine that, huh, me workin' for you". Whoa, oh, oh. Sign, sign, everywhere a sign. Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind. Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?. And the sign said, â€½Anybody caught trespassin' would be shot on sightâ€. So, I jumped on the fence and-a yelled at the house. "Hey, what gives you the right?. To put up a fence to keep me out or to keep mother nature in. If God was here, He'd tell you to your face, man, you're some kinda sinner". Sign, sign, everywhere a sign. Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind. Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?. Now, hey you, Mister, can't you read?. You've got to have a shirt and tie to get a seat. You can't even watch, no you can't eat. You ain't supposed to be here. The sign said, â€½You got to have a membership card to get inside, ughâ€. And the sign said, "Everybody welcome, come in, kneel down and pray". But when they passed around the plate at the end of it all. I didn't have a penny to pay. So, I got me a pen and a paper and I made up my own little sign. I said, "Thank you, Lord, for thinkin' 'bout me, I'm alive and doin' fine, wooâ€. Sign, sign, everywhere a sign. Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind. Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?. Sign, sign, everywhere a sign. Sign. Sign, signMother, you had me, but I never had you. I wanted you, you didn't want me. So I, I just got to tell you. Goodbye, goodbye. Father, you left me, but I never left you. I needed you, you didn't need me. So I, I just got to tell you. Goodbye, goodbye. Children, don't do what I have done. I couldn't walk and I tried to run. So I, I just got to tell you. Goodbye, goodbye. Mama don't go. Daddy come home. Mama don't go. Daddy come home. Mama don't go. Daddy come home. Mama don't go. Daddy come home. Mama don't go. Daddy come home. Mama don't go. Daddy come home. Mama don't go. Daddy come home. Mama don't go. Daddy come home. Mama don't go. Daddy come home. Mama don't go. Daddy come homeFriends all tried to warn me. But I held my head up high. All the time they warned me. But I only passed them by. They all tried to tell me. But I guess, I didn't care. I turned my back and. Left them standing there. All the burning bridges that have fallen after me. All the lonely feelings and the burning memories. Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door. Burning bridges lost forevermore. Joey tried to help me find a job, a while ago. When I finally got it I didn't want to go. The party Mary gave for me when I just walked away. Now there's nothing left for me to say. All the burning bridges that have fallen after me. All the lonely feelings and the burning memories. Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door. Burning bridges lost forevermore. Years have passed and I keep thinking, what a fool I've been. I look back into the past and think of way back then. I know that I lost everything I thought I that could win. I guess, I should have listened to my friends. All the burning bridges that have fallen after me. All the lonely feelings and the burning memories. Everyone I left behind each time I closed the door. Burning bridges lost forevermore. Burning bridges lost forevermoreA long, long time ago, I can still remember. How that music used to make me smile. And I knew if I had my chance. That I could make those people dance. And maybe they'd be happy for a while. . But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver. Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step. I can't remember if I cried, when I read about his widowed bride. But something touched me deep inside the day the music died. . So bye, bye Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry. And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye. Singing this'll be the day that I die. This'll be the day that I die. . Did you write the book of love. And do you have faith in God above. If the Bible tells you so?. Now do you believe in rock and roll?. Can music save your mortal soul?. And can you teach me how to dance real slow?. . Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. You both kicked off your shoes. Man, I dig those rhythm and blues. . I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck. With a pink carnation and a pickup truck. But I knew I was out of luck. The day the music died. . I started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry. Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye. And singing this'll be the day that I die. This'll be the day that I die. . Now, for ten years we've been on our own. And moss grows fat on a rolling stone. But that's not how it used to be. When the jester sang for the king and queen. In a coat he borrowed from James Dean. And a voice that came from you and me. . Oh, and while the king was looking down. The jester stole his thorny crown. The courtroom was adjourned. No verdict was returned. . And while Lenin read a book on Marx. The quartet practiced in the park. And we sang 'Dirges In The Dark'. The day the music died. . We were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry. Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye. And singing this'll be the day that I die. This'll be the day that I die. . Helter skelter in a summer swelter. The birds flew off with a fallout shelter. Eight miles high and falling fast. Landed foul on the grass. The players tried for a forward pass. With the jester on the sidelines in a cast. . Now the half time air was sweet perfume. While sergeants played a marching tune. We all got up to dance. Oh, but we never got the chance. . 'Cause the players tried to take the field. The marching band refused to yield. Do you recall what was revealed. The day the music died?. . We started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry. Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye. And singing this'll be the day that I die. This'll be the day that I die. . Oh, and there we were all in one place. A generation lost in space. With no time left to start again. So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick. Jack Flash sat on a candlestick. 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend. . Oh, and as I watched him on the stage. My hands were clenched in fists of rage. No angel born in hell. Could break that Satan's spell. . And as the flames climbed high into the night. To light the sacrificial rite. I saw Satan laughing with delight. The day the music died. . He was singing bye, bye Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry. Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye. And singing this'll be the day that I die. This'll be the day that I die. . I met a girl who sang the blues. And I asked her for some happy news. But she just smiled and turned away. I went down to the sacred store. Where I'd heard the music years before. But the man there said the music wouldn't play. . And in the streets the children screamed. The lovers cried and the poets dreamed. But not a word was spoken. The church bells all were broken. . And the three men I admire most. The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost. They caught the last train for the coast. The day the music died. . And they were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry. Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye. Singing this'll be the day that I die. This'll be the day that I die. . They were singing, bye, bye Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry. Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye. Singing this'll be the day that I dieNo, I can't forget this evening. Or your face as you were leaving. But I guess that's just the way the story goes. You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows. Yes, it shows. No, I can't forget tomorrow. When I think of all my sorrow. When I had you there but then I let you go. And now it's only fair that I should let you know. What you should know. I can't live if living is without you. I can't live, I can't give any more. I can't live if living is without you. I can't give, I can't give any more. No, I can't forget this evening. Or your face as you were leaving. But I guess that's just the way the story goes.

This is my, my, my, beautiful day. When you say, say, say, say that you love me. Oh, my, my, my it's a beautiful dayIn a little while from now. If I'm not feeling any less sour. I promise myself to treat myself. And visit a nearby tower. And climbing to the top, will throw myself off. In an effort to make it clear. To who ever what it's like when you're shattered. Left standing in the lurch at a church. Where people saying, "My God, that's tough. She's stood him up no point in us remaining. We may as well go home". As I did on my own alone again, naturally. To think that only yesterday. I was cheerful, bright and gay. Looking forward to well who wouldn't do. The role I was about to play. But as if to knock me down reality came around. And without so much, as a mere touch. Cut me into little pieces leaving me to doubt. Talk about God in His mercy. Who if He really does exist. Why did he desert me in my hour of need. I truly am indeed, alone again, naturally. It seems to me that there are more hearts. Broken in the world that can't be mended. Left unattended. What do we do? What do we do?. Alone again, naturally. Now looking back over the years. And whatever else that appears. I remember I cried when my father died. Never wishing to hide the tears. And at sixty-five years old. My mother, God rest her soul. Couldn't understand why the only man. She had ever loved had been taken. Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken. Despite encouragement from me. No words were ever spoken and when she passed away. I cried and cried all day, alone again, naturally. Alone again, naturallyClair, the moment I met you. I swear I felt as if something. Somewhere had happened to me. Which I couldn't see. And then the moment I met you again. I knew in my heart that we were friends. It had to be so it couldn't be no. But try as hard as I might do. I don't know why you get to me. In a way I can't describe. Words mean so little. When you look up and smile. I don't care what people say to me. You're more than a child, oh Clair. Clair. Clair, if ever a moment so rare. Was captured for all to compare. That moment is you in all that you do. But why in spite of our age difference. Do I cry each time I leave you. I feel I could die. Nothing means more to me. Than hearing you say. â€½I'm going to marry you. Will you marry me, Uncle Ray?". Oh Clair, Clair. Clair I've told you before don't you dare. Get back into bed can't you see that is late. No you can't have a drink. Oh alright then, but wait just a bit. While I in an effort to baby sit. Capture my breath what there is left of it. You can be murder at this hour of the day. But in the morning tonight will seem a life time away. Oh Clair, ClairOn the first part of the journey. I was looking at all the life. There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and rings. The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz. And the sky with no clouds. The heat was hot and the ground was dry. But the air was full of sound. I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. Cause there ain't no one 4-2 give you no pain. La, la. After two days in the desert sun. My skin began to turn red. After three days in the desert fun. I was looking at a river bed. And the story it told of a river that flowed. Made me sad to think it was dead. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, la. After nine days I let the horse run free. Cause the desert had turned to sea. There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and rings. The ocean is a desert with it's life underground. And a perfect disguise above. Under the cities lies a heart made of ground. But the humans will give no love. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain. In the desert you can remember your name. Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain. La, laSong Sung Blue. Everybody knows one. Song Sung Blue. Every garden grows one.

And it serves a hundred ships a day. Lonely sailors pass the time away. And talk about their homes. And there's a girl in this harbor town. And she works laying whiskey down. They say, "Brandy, fetch another round". She serves them whiskey and wine. The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl". What a good wife you would be. Yeah your eyes could steal. A sailor from the sea". Brandy wears a braided chain. Made of finest silver from the North of Spain. A locket that bears the name. Of the man that Brandy loves. He came on a summer's day. Bringing gifts from far away. But he made it clear he couldn't stay. No harbor was his home. The sailor said, "Brandy, you're a fine girl. What a good wife you would be. But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea". Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes. When he told his sailor stories. She could feel the ocean foam rise. She saw its raging glory. But he had always told the truth. Lord, he was an honest man. And Brandy does her best to understand. At night when the bar's close down. Brandy walks through a silent town. And loves a man who's not around. She still can hear him say. She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl. What a good wife you would be. But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea". "Brandy, you're a fine girl. "What a good wife you would be. But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"Women think I'm tasty. But they're always tryin' to waste me. Make me burn the candle right down. Baby, baby. I don't need no jewels in my crown. 'Cause all you women is low down gamblers. Cheatin' like, I don't know how. Baby, baby, there's fever in the funk house now. This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a itchin'. You know you know the deuce is still wild. Baby, I can't stay, you got to roll me. And call me the tumblin' dice. Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry. Don't you see the time flashin' by?. Honey, got no money, I'm all sixes and sevens and nines. Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider. You can be my partner in crime. Baby, I can't stay. You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'. Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice. Oh, my, my, my, I'm the lone crap shooter. Playin' the field every night. Baby, can't stay. You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice. Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice. Got to roll me, got to roll me, got to roll me. Got to roll me. got to roll me, got to roll me. Got to roll me. got to roll me, got to roll me. ...Starry, starry night. Paint your pallet blue and gray. Look out on a summer's day. With eyes that know the darkness in my soul. . Shadows on the hills. Sketch the trees and the daffodils. Catch the breeze and the winter chills. In colors on the snowy linen land. . Now I understand. What you tried to say to me. How you suffered for your sanity. How you tried to set them free. . They would not listen. They did not know how. Perhaps they'll listen now. . Starry, starry night. Flaming flowers that brightly blaze. Swirling clouds in violet haze. Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue. . Colors changing hue. Morning field of amber grain. Weathered faces lined in pain. Are soothed beneath the artist’s loving hand. . Now I understand. What you tried to say to me. How you suffered for your sanity. How you tried to set them free. . They would not listen. They did not know how. Perhaps they'll listen now. . For they could not love you. But still your love was true. . And when no hope was left in sight. On that starry, starry night. You took your life as lovers often do. . But I could have told you Vincent. This world was never meant. For one as beautiful as you. . Starry, starry night. Portraits hung in empty halls. Frameless heads on nameless walls. With eyes that watch the world and can't forget. . Like the strangers that you've met. The ragged men in ragged clothes. The silver thorn of bloody rose. Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow. . Now I think I know. What you tried to say to me. How you suffered for your sanity. How you tried to set them free. . They would not listen. They're not listening still. Perhaps they never willMorning has broken like the first morning. Blackbird has spoken like the first bird. Praise for the singing, praise for the morning. Praise for them springing fresh from the word. Sweet the rain's new fall sunlit from heaven. Like the first dewfall on the first grass. Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden. Sprung in completeness where His feet pass. Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning. Born of the one light, Eden saw play. Praise with elation, praise every morning. God's recreation of the new day. Morning has broken like the first morning. Blackbird has spoken like the first bird. Praise for the singing, praise for the morning. Praise for them springing fresh from the wordSo this is Christmas. And what have you done. Another year over. And a new one just begun. And so this is Christmas. I hope you have fun.

NowNo, I would not give you false hope. On this strange and mournful day. But the mother and child reunion. Is only a motion away. Oh, little darling of mine, I can't for the life of me. Remember a sadder day I know they say, "Let it be". But it just don't work out that way. And the course of a lifetime runs. Over and over again. No, I would not give you false hope. On this strange and mournful day. But the mother and child reunion. Is only a motion away. Oh, little darling of mine, I just can't believe it's so. Though it seems strange to say I never been laid so low. In such a mysterious way and the course of a lifetime runs. Over and over again. But I would not give you false hope. On this strange and mournful day. When the mother and child reunion. Is only a motion away. Oh, the mother and child reunion. Is only a motion away. Oh, the mother and child reunion.

Let's take the average. cave man at home, listening to his stereo. Sometimes he'd get up,. try to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this:. "Dance... dance". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look. in the mirror: "Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a. woman gotta find a woman". He'd go down to the lake where all the. woman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look. around and just reach in and grab one. "Come here... come here".. He'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause. it might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd. be swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there,. wet and frightened. He said: "Move... move". She got up. She was a. big woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one. of the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said:. "Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me. sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!". She looked down on him.. She was ready to crush him, but she began to like him. She said. (falsetto):. "I'll sock it to ya, Daddy". He said: "Wha?". She said (falsetto):. "I'll sock it to ya, Daddy". You know what he said?

I was feeling something wasn't right. There was not another soul in sight. Only you, only you. . So we walked along. Though I knew there was something wrong. And the feeling hit me, oh, so strong. About you. . Then you gazed up at me. And the answer was plain to see. 'Cause I saw the light in your eyes. In your eyes. . Though we had our fling. I just never would suspect a thing. Till that little bell began to ring in my head. In my head, in my head. . But I tried to run. Though I knew it wouldn't help me none. 'Cause I couldn't ever love no one. Or so I said. . But my feelings for you. Were just something I never knew. Till I saw the light in your eyes. In your eyes. . But I love you best. It's not something that I say in jest. 'Cause you're different girl from all the rest. In my eyes. . And I ran out before. But I won't do it anymore. Can't you see the light in my eyes. In my eyes, in my eyes, in my eyesLady: Ragtop records, may I help you?. Fly: Can I speak to Fo?. Lady: One moment please, he's around. 4-Tay: Yo, wassup?. Fly: Wassup, Fo? I know you finished that cut for the radio. 4-Tay: As a matter of fact Fly I just finished it baby boy, no worry about nothin', I'll be around. Regardless if I'm chillin' backstage or on tour. With my homie Young Fly even I'll be sure. Never hesitate to call me after I'm done. Cause homie I'm real and always true to my loved ones. Too many wakes and funerals full of tears. You say there's something on your mind, well hey, I'm all ears. Cause ain't nobody thinking about the funk that you're choosin' it. A lot of my homies stuck in the pen for life or losin' it. Call up your folks you keep thinkin' about home. Recorder keeps a peep and there's a block on the phone. And all of this is enough to make a brother's nerves bad. Reminds me of a situation that I once had. Spent that, spent this endless relentless tremendous women on my jock. And don't nobody mind their business. He say she say throwin' salt about it. And chooses to talk about you cause there's no one else to talk about. Talk about the show and the flow and all the clout. Then be real with yourself and talk about and turned it out. It's not hard to compete when his name is poppin'. A scared man can never win that's why I stay clockin'. Fools be huffin' and puffin' don't wanna see me about nothin' I'm down. And if you ever need me Fly: I'll be around. Whenever you call me: I'll be there. Whenever you want me: I'll be there. Whenever you need me: I'll be there. Life ain't based on peaches and cream. This new generation lost a whole lot of dreams. Future doctors, producers, and mothers. The list goes on but now we killin' our brothers. And if we killin' our brothers that means we killin' our own kind. These kids is watchin' now it goes to their mind. Rat-tat-a-tat cause you got a gat. Then they want a gat you livin' like that?. Moms ain't cookin' she worked the week straight. If anything she's the one deserves a hot plate. The ghetto, the ghetto ain't nothin' to dream about. Tryin' to get out now that's somethin' to think about. Fools might disagree but I'm a stay sucka free. Now I'm so black and so strong they can't fade me. Blacks are blacks worst enemy there's still no remedy. You got me for a grip do you call yourself kin of me?. Jealousy, envy, I see it in your eyes. Tell me what's wrong with seeing a black man rise. I keep it funky it's pretty hard to miss it now it is not explicit. A message for the mind, and a moral for statistics. So I'm doin' what we call a roll call. Talkin' about the ones who won't rap then take a downfall. I spit the street life and then I go underground. You silly, it's called versatility and I'll be around. Things are gettin' crucial you gotta exercise your mind. Or learn about life before you're left behind. But how you gonna get it right when you're not doin' right. When you get mad all you want is a gunfight. This tension causes a gang of madness. Now you want funk that results to sadness. Sadness results to a lot of revenge. And your so called friends really ain't your friends. So how do you know who you're able to trust. If you think about the past look what happened to us. I never trust no one, I only trust myself. Or I would've been a victim like everyone else. In friendship or hardship whenever you need me. Just give me a call G I won't deceive thee. These fools be shakin' best believe they're fakin'. Just tryin' to get a grip of all the money you're makin'. This ain't race a mind is a terrible thing to waste. I drop the rap and J drops the bass. To the flow cause ain't nobody get with Fo. I'm a down young brother comin' straight outta Frisco. Droppin' a message out of love to your town. Love your brothers and sisters and I'll be aroundAnd if it's bad. Don't let it get you down. You can take it. And if it hurts. Don't let them see you cry. You can take it. Hold your head up. Hold your head up. Hold your head up. Hold your head high. And if they stare. Just let them burn.

We took some salty bacon and a hammock for a bed. Then we mixed it with the Spaniards in the middle of the Med. Well, we hired our funds, saw the pretty girls a comin'. There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago. We hired some more and then we started runnin'. All down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Well, Francis Drake said if you really want a fight. The best thing is to catch them in the middle of the night. We hoisted anchor and powdered up the gun. Then we sailed around in circles and just waited for the fun. Well, we hired our funds, saw the pretty girls a-comin'. There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago. We hired some more and then we started runnin'. All down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Well, cannon balls flew and the ship began to sink. The water started risin', so we really had to think. And then by chance stood a man as black as coal. So we grabbed him by the trousers and we plugged him in the hole. Well, we hired our funds, saw the pretty girls a-comin'. There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago. We hired some more and then we started runnin'. All down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Well, we fired from the side port and we fired from the back. And then we fired from the gallery and through every little crack. We fired so much that the cook started cooking. Didn't have to worry so we flew the Union Jack. Well, we hired our funds, saw the pretty girls a comin'. There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago. We hired some more and then we started runnin'. All down the Mississippi to the Gulf of MexicoWho draws the crowd and plays so loud, baby it's the guitar man. Who's gonna steal the show, you know baby it's the guitar man.

Night after night who treats you right, baby it's the guitar man. Who's on the radio, you go listen to the guitar man. Then he comes to town and you see his face. And you think you might like to take his place. Somethin' keeps him driftin' miles and miles away. Searchin' for the songs to play.. . Then you listen to the music and you like to sing along. You want to get the meaning out of each and every song. Then you find yourself a message and some words. To call your own and take them home.. . He can make you love, he can get you high. He will bring you down then he'll make you cry. Somethin' keeps him movin' but no one seems to know. What it is that makes him go.. .

But man, that hair just had to go. Na, na, na, na, na. Ain't no glory in this fable. Like the story Cane and Abel. Samson's gonna turn the tables. Samson had a feeling. That God would guide his feeble hand. Man you should've seen him. Pushin' pillars from the stand. On the Friday evening. Things were going mighty fine. Then he started sleeping.

You don't know how many times. I wished that I could hold you. You don't know how many times. I've wished that I could mold you into someone. Who could cherish me as much as I cherish you. Perish is the word that more than applies. To the hope in my heart each time I realize. That I am not going to be the one. To share your dreams. That I am not going to be the one. To share your schemes. That I am not going to be the one. To share what seems to be the life. That you could cherish me as much as I do yours. Oh, I'm beginning to think. That man has never found. The words that could make you want me. That have the right amount of letters. Just the right sound. That could make you hear. Make you see. That you're driving me out of my mind. Oh I could say I need you. But then you'd realize that I want you. Just like a thousand other guys. Who say they'd love you. With all the rest of their lives. When all they wanted was to. Touch your face, your hands. And gaze into your eyes. Cherish is the word I use to describe. All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside. You don't know how many times. I wished that I had told you. You don't know how many times. I wished that I could hold you. You don't know how many times. I wished that I could mold you into someone.

She said, "Son, please beware. There's this thing called love. And it's everywhere". . She told me, "It can break your heart. And put you in misery". Since I met this little woman. I feel it's happened to me. And I'm tellin' you. . It's too late to turn back now. I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love. It's too late to turn back now. I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love. . I found myself wantin' her. At least ten times a day. You know, it's so unusual for me. To carry on this way. . I'm tellin' you, I can't sleep at night. Wantin' to hold her tight. I've tried so hard to convince myself. That this feelin' just can't be right. And I'm tellin' you. . It's too late to turn back now. I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love. It's too late to turn back now. I believe, I believe I believe, I'm fallin' in love. . It's too late to turn back now oh, baby. I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love. It's too late, baby to turn back now I tell ya. I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love. . I wouldn't mind it. If I knew she really loved me too. But I hate to think that I'm in love alone. And nothing that I can do. . It's too late to turn back now. I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love. It's too late, baby to turn back now I tell ya. I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in love.

I believe, I believe, I believe, I'm fallin' in loveI had nothing to do on this hot afternoon. But to settle down and write you a line. I've been meaning to phone you, but from Minnesota. Hell it's been a very long time. . You wear it well. A little old fashioned but that's all right. . Well, I suppose you're thinking I bet he's sinking. Or he wouldn't get in touch with me. Oh, I ain't begging or losing my head. I sure do want you to know. . That you wear it well. There ain't a lady in the land so fine, oh my. . Remember them basement parties, your brother's karate. The all day rock 'n' roll shows. Their homesick blues and the radical views. Haven't left a mark on you. . You wear it well. A little out of time but I don't mind. . But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine. But I blew it without even tryin'. Now I'm eatin' my heart out. Tryin' to get a letter through. . Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on. I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town. When you sat down and cried on the stairs. You knew it didn't cost the earth, but for what it's worth. You made me feel a millionaire. . And you wear it well. Madame Onassis got nothing on you, no, no. . Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told. That I gotta get back to work. So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone. Think of me and try not to laugh. . And I wear it well. I don't object if you call Collect. . 'Cos I ain't forgetting that you were once mine. But I blew it without even tryin'. Now I'm eatin' my heart out. Tryin' to get back to you. . I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you. Oh, yeah. . After all the years I hope it's the same address. Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on, oh no, oh noEverybody plays the fool sometime. There's no exception to the rule. Listen, baby, it may be factual, may be cruel. I ain't lying, everybody plays the fool. Falling in love is such an easy thing to do. And there's no guarantee that the one you love is gonna love you. Oh, lovin' eyes they cannot see a certain person could never be. Love runs deeper than any ocean. You can cloud your mind with emotion. Everybody plays the fool, sometime. They use your heart like a tool. Listen, baby, they never tell you so in school. But everybody plays the fool. How can you help it when the music starts to play. And your ability to reason is swept away. Oh, heaven on earth is all you see. You're out of touch with reality. Now you cry but when you're through. The next time someone cries for youSunshine go away today. I don't feel much like dancin'. Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life. He don't know what he's askin'. When he tells me I better get in line. I can't hear what he's sayin'. When I grow up, I'm gonna make it mine. These ain't dues I been payin'. Well how much does it cost?. I'll buy it. The time is all we've lost. I'll try it. And he can't even run his own life. I'll be damned if he'll run mine, sunshine. Sunshine, go away today. I don't feel much like dancin'. Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life. He don't know what he's askin'. Workin' starts to make me wonder where. Fruits of what I do are goin'. When he says in love and war all is fair. He's got cards he ain't showin'. How much does it cost?. I'll buy it. The time is all we've lost. I'll try it. And he can't even run his own life. I'll be damned if he'll run mine, sunshine. Sunshine, come on back another day. I promise you I'll be singin'. This old world, she's gonna turn around. Brand new bells will be ringin'She was just sixteen and all alone. When I came to be. So we grew up together. My mama child and me. Now things were bad and she was scared. But whenever I would cry. She'd calm my fears and dry my tears. With a rock and roll lullaby. And she'd sing sha na na na na na na na na. It'll be all right. Sha na na na na na na na na na. Just hold on tight. Sing it to me mama, mama mama mama. Sing it sweet and clear. Oh, mama let me hear that old rock and roll lullaby. Now, we made it through the lonely days. But Lord the nights were long. And we'd dream of better moments. When mama sang her song. Now I can't recall the words at all. It don't make sense to try. 'Cause I just knew lots of love came through. In that rock and roll lullaby. And she'd sing sha na na na na na na na na. It'll be all right. Sha na na na na na na na na na. Just hold on tight. I can hear you mama, mama mama mama. Nothing moves my soul. Like the sound of a good old rock and roll lullaby. It'll be alright. Just hold on tight. Mama, mama, mama. Nothing moves my soul. Like the sound of a good old rock and roll lullaby. It'll be alright. Just hold on tight. Sing it sweet and clearWell, Billy rapped all night about his suicide. How he'd kick it in the head when he was twenty-five. Speed jive, don't want to stay alive. When you're twenty-five. And Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks and Sparks. And Freddy's got spots from ripping off the stars. From his face. Funky little boat race. Television man is crazy.

Telling my whole life with his words. Killing me softly with his song. I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style. And so I came to see him to listen for a while. And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes. Strumming my pain with his fingers. Singing my life with his words. Killing me softly with his song. Killing me softly with his song. Telling my whole life with his words. Killing me softly with his song. I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd. I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud. I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on. Strumming my pain with his fingers. Singing my life with his words. Killing me softly with his song. Killing me softly with his song. Telling my whole life with his words. Killing me softly with his song. He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair. And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there.

Telling my whole life with his words. Killing me softly with his song. Strumming my pain with his fingers. Singing my life with his words. Killing me softly with his song.

Your hat strategically dipped below one eye. Your scarf it was apricot. You had one eye in the mirror as you watched yourself gavotte. And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner they'd be your partner and. You're so vain. You probably think this song is about you. You're so vain (you're so vain). I bet you think this song is about you. Don't you don't you?. You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive. Well you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave. But you gave away the things you loved. And one of them was me. I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee clouds in my coffee and. You're so vain. You probably think this song is about you.

Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock. While the other kids were rocking round the clock. We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock. Well 'Crocodile Rocking' is something shocking. When your feet just can't keep still. I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will. Oh Lawdy Mama those Friday nights. When Suzie wore her dresses tight. And the 'Crocodile Rocking' was out of the sight. La, la la la. La la la. La la la. But the years went by and the rock just died. Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy. Long nights crying by the record machine. Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans. But they'll never kill the thrills we've got. Burning up to the Crocodile Rock. Learning fast as the weeks went past. We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last. Well 'Crocodile Rocking' is something shocking. When your feet just can't keep still. I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will. Oh Lawdy Mama those Friday nights. When Suzie wore her dresses tight. And the 'Crocodile Rocking' was out of the sight. La, la la la. La la la.

I felt the blood go to my feet. Now, it took time for me to know. What you tried so not to show. Something in my soul just cried. I see the want in your blue eyes. Baby, I'd love you to want me. The way that I want you. The way that it should be. Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you. The way that I want to. If you'd only let it be. You told yourself years ago. You'd never let your feelings show. The obligation that you made. For the title that they gave. Baby, I'd love you to want me. The way that I want you. The way that it should be.

My dreams are getting so strange. I'd like to tell you everything I see. Oh, I see a man in the back as a matter of fact. His eyes were as red as the sun. And the girl in the corner that no one ignores. Cause she thinks she's the passionate one. Oh Yeah! It was like lightning. Everybody was frightening. And the music was soothing. And they all started grooving. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah. And the man in the back said everyone attack. And it turned into a ballroom blitz. And the girl in the corner said boy I want to warn you. It'll turn into a ballroom blitz. Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz. Oh reaching out for something. Touching nothing's all I ever do. Oh I softly call you over. When you appear there's nothing left of you. And the man in the back is ready to crack. As he raises his hands to the sky. And the girl in the corner is everyone's mourner. She could kill you with a wink of her eye. Oh Yeah! It was electric. So frantically hectic. And the band started leaving. Cause they all stopped breathing. Oh Yeah! It was like lightning. Everybody was frightening. And the music was soothing. And they all started grooving. It's it's a ballroom blitz. It's it's a ballroom blitz. It's it's a ballroom blitz. Yeah, it's a ballroom blitzWhen are you gonna come down?. When are you going to land?. I should have stayed on the farm. I should have listened to my old man. You know you can't hold me forever. I didn't sign up with you. I'm not a present for your friends to open. This boy's too young to be singing the blues. So goodbye yellow brick road. Where the dogs of society howl. You can't plant me in your penthouse. I'm going back to my plough. Back to the howling old owl in the woods. Hunting the horny back toad. Oh, I've finally decided my future lies. Beyond the yellow brick road. What do you think you'll do then?. I bet that'll shoot down your plane. It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics. To set you on your feet again. Maybe you'll get a replacement. There's plenty like me to be found. Mongrels who ain't got a penny. Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground. So goodbye yellow brick road. Where the dogs of society howl. You can't plant me in your penthouse. I'm going back to my plough. Back to the howling old owl in the woods. Hunting the horny back toad. Oh I've finally decided my future lies. Beyond the yellow brick roadTold you once before. And I won't tell you no more. Get down, get down, get down. You're a bad dog, baby. But I still want you 'round. You give me the creeps. When you jump on your feet. So get down, get down, get down. Keep your hands to yourself. I'm strictly out of bounds. Once upon a time I drank a little wine. Was as happy as could be, happy as could be. Now I'm just like a cat on a hot tin roof. Baby what do you think you're doin' to me. Told you once before. And I won't tell you no more. So get down, get down, get down. You're a bad dog, baby. But I still want you 'round, around. I still want you around, aye, aye, aye. I don't give a damn. And I'd like you if you can to. Get down, get down, get down. You're bad dog, baby. But I still want you 'round. Once upon a time I drank a little wine. Was as happy as could be, happy as could be. Now I'm just like a cat on a hot tin roof. Baby, what do you think you're doin' to me. Told you once before. And I won't tell you no more. So get down, get down, get down. You're a bad dog, baby. But I still want you 'round, aroundEvery time I see your face. It reminds me of the places we used to go. But all I've got is a photograph. And I realize you're not coming back anymore. I thought I'd make it the day you went away. But I can't make it 'til you come home again to stay. I can't get used to living here. While my heart is broke, my tears I cry for you. I want you here to have and hold. As the years go by, and we grow old and grey. Now you're expecting me to live without you. But that's not something that I'm looking forward to. I can't get used to living here. While my heart is broke, my tears I cry for you. I want you here to have and hold. As the years go by, and we grow old and grey. Every time I see your face. It reminds me of the places we used to go. But all I've got is a photograph. And I realize you're not coming back anymore. Every time I see your face. It reminds me of the places we used to go.

And it's tellin' me that things are not the same. In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze. There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me. . There is only one wish on my mind. When this day is through I hope that I will find. That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me. All I need will be mine if you are here. .

Sing us a song, you're the piano man. Sing us a song tonight.. Well, we're all in the mood for a melody. And you've got us feelin' alright. It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday,. And the manager gives me a smile. 'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see. To forget about life for awhile.. And the piano sounds like a carnival. And the microphone smells like a beer. And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar. And say "Man, what are you doin' here?". La la da de de da. La la de de da da da.

Think you got endo, hold your breath. Spittin on the track with Red and Meth. Holdin up a fat, when you smoke a cassette. Or CDs, we bees the ones with the Ouija's. Spread it on the arm, come on believe me. Look who it is, it's the funky feel. Smokin assassin from Cypress Hill. We think she's just resonated?. Fillin my brain till it's saturated.

With all this weed, get high tonight. BITCH!. Chorus 2 timesMy baby makes me proud, Lord don't she make me proud. She never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd. 'Cause people like to talk, Lord, don't they love to talk. But when they turn out the lights, I know she'll be leaving with me. And when we get behind closed doors. Then she lets her hair hang down. And she makes me glad that I'm a man. Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors. My baby makes me smile, Lord don't she make me smile. She's never too far away or too tired to say "I want you". She's always a lady, just like a lady should be. But when they turn out the lights, she's still a baby to me. And when we get behind closed doors. Then she lets her hair hang down. And she makes me glad that I'm a man. Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors. Behind closed doorsMy father is a doctor, he's a family man. My mother works for charity whenever she can. They're both good clean Americans who abide by the law. And they both stick up for liberty and they both support the war. My happiness was paid for when they laid their money down. For summers in a summer camp and winters in the tow. My future in the system was talked about and planned. But I gave it up for music and the free electric band. I went to school in hand-washed shirts with neatly ordered hair. And the school was big and newly built and filled with light and air. And the teacher taught us values that we had to learn to keep. And he clipped the ear of many idle kid who went to sleep. Then my father organized for me a college in the east. But I went to California, the sunshine and the beach. My parents and my lecturers could never understand. Why I gave it up for music and the free electric band. Well, they used to sit and speculate upon their son's career. A lawyer or a doctor or a civil engineer. Just give me bread and water, put a guitar in my hand. 'Cause all I need is music and the free electric band. My father sent me money, and I spent it very fast. On a girl I met in Berkeley in a social science class. Yes, and we learnt about her body, but her mind we didn't know. Until deep rooted attitudes and morals began to show. She wanted to get married even though she never said. But I knew her well enough by now to see inside her head. She'd settle for suburbia and a little patch of land. So I gave her up for music and the free electric bandWhen I think back on all the crap I've learned in high school. It's a wonder I can think at all. And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none. I can read the writing on the wall. Kodachrome, they give us those nice bright colors. Gives those greens of summers. They make you think that all the world's a sunny day. Well I've got a, a Nikon camera. I love to take photographs. So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away. If you took all the girls I knew when I was single. Brought them all together for one night. They never matched my sweet imagination. And everything looks better in black and white. They give us those, those nice bright colors. Gives those greens of summers. They make you think that all the world's a sunny day. Well I've got a, a Nikon camera. I love to take photographs. So Mama don't take my Kodachrome away. Mama don't take my Kodachrome away. Don't take my Kodachrome away. Mama don't take my Kodachrome. Mama don't take my Kodachrome.

But we had yesterday. (Hey!). Wasn't it me, who said that nothing good's gonna last forever?. And wasn't it me, who said, "Let's just be glad for the time together?". It must've been hard to tell me that you've given all you had to give. I can understand you're feeling that way. Everybody's got their life to live. Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light. But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night. If I've got to be strong, don't you know. I need to have, tonight, when you're gone?. 'Till you go, I need to lie here and think about. The last time that you'll. Touch me in the morning. Then just close the door. Leave me as you found me. Empty like before. (Hey!). Wasn't it yesterday, we used to laugh at the wind behind us?. Didn't we run away and hope that time wouldn't try to find us?. (Didn't we run?). Didn't we take each other, to a place where no one's ever been?. Yeah, I really need you near me, tonight. 'Cause you'll never take me there again. Let me watch you go with the sun in my eyes. We've seen how love can grow, now we'll see how it dies. If I've got to be strong, don't you know.

It's the time that every santa has a ball. Does he ride a red-nose reindeer. Does a ton-up on his sleigh. Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?. So here it is Merry Christmas. Everybody's having fun. Look to the future now. It's only just begun. Are you waiting for the family to arrive. Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside. Does your granny always tell you. That the old songs are the best. Then she's up and rock 'n' rolling with the rest. So here it is Merry Christmas. Everybody's having fun. Look to the future now. It's only just begun. What did your daddy do. When he saw your momma kissing Santa. Aaah ah aaah aahh. Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall. Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall. Do you ride on down the hillside. On a buggy you have made. When you land upon your head. And you've been 'Slade'. So here it is merry christmas. Everybody's having fun. Look to the future now. It's only just begun. So here it is merry christmas. Everybody's having fun. Look to the future now. It's only just begun. So here it is merry christmas. Everybody's having fun. (It's christmas!).

I guess neither one of us. Neither one of us wants to be the first to say good-bye. I keep wondering. Wondering. What I'm gonna do without you. And I guess you must be wondering the same thing too. So we go on. Go on together. Living a lie. Because neither one of us. Neither one of us wants to be the first to say good-bye. Everytime I find the nerve. Everytime I find the nerve to say I'm leaving, OLD MEMORIES. Those old memories. . get in my way. Lord knows it's only me. Heaven knows it's only me. That I'm decieving. When it comes to saying good-bye. That's a simple word that I just cannot say. There can be no way. There can be no way. This can have a happy ending. No, no. So we just go on. Hurting and pretending. Convincing ourselves to give it just one more try. Because neither one of us. Neither one of us wants to be the first to say. Neither one of us wants to be the first to say. Neither one of us wants to be the first to say. Farewell my love. GoodbyeMarie Osmond. Miscellaneous. Paper Roses.

And you fire till he is done in but they catch you at the border. And the mourners are all singin' as they drag you by your feet. But the hangman isn't hangin' and they put you on the street. You go back, Jack do it again, wheel turnin' round and round. You go back, Jack do it again. When you know she's no high climber then you find your only friend. In a room with your two timer and you're sure you're near the end. Then you love a little wild one and she brings you only sorrow. All the time you know she's smilin' you'll be on your knees tomorrow. You go back, Jack do it again, wheel turnin' round and round. You go back, Jack do it again. Now you swear and kick and beg us that you're not a gamblin', man. Then you find you're back in Vegas with a handle in your hand. Your black cards can make you money so you hide them when you're able. In the land of milk and honey, you must put them on the table, yeah. You go back, Jack do it again, wheel turnin' round and round. You go back, Jack do it againIf I could save time in a bottle. The first thing that I'd like to do. Is to save every day 'til eternity passes away. Just to spend them with you. If I could make days last forever. If words could make wishes come true. I'd save every day like a treasure and then. Again, I would spend them with you. But there never seems to be enough time. To do the things you want to do once you find them. I've looked around enough to know. That you're the one I want to go through time with. If I had a box just for wishes. And dreams that had never come true. The box would be empty except for the memory. Of how they were answered by you. But there never seems to be enough time. To do the things you want to do once you find them. I've looked around enough to know. That you're the one I want to go through time withMy friend Stan’s got a funny old man. Oh yeah, oh yeah. He makes him work all night 'til he can’t do it right. Oh yeah, aha. And from the way you blacked my eye,. I know that you’re the reason why. And from the way you fix his tie. I see you're gettin’ to him, gettin’ to him. . My friend Jack’s got an ache in his back. Oooooh oh yeah. The doc said he’d be fine if he’d just take his time. Ohh oh, ooh. And from the way you blacked my eye. I know that you’re the reason why. And from the way you fix his tie. I see you're gettin’ to him, you've been gettin’ to him - kinky!. . And from the way you blacked my eye. I know that you’re the reason why. And from the way you fix his tie. I see you're gettin’ to him, you've been gettin’ to him. . My friend Pete says his body is weak. Oh yeah, aha. He told me he can’t sleep and his temperature’s steep. Oh yeah, woho. And from the way you blacked my eye,. I know that you’re the reason why. And from the way you fix his tie. I see you're gettin’ to him, you've been gettin’ to him,. You've been gettin’ to him, you've been gettin’ to him. Oh yeah!. .We're still together after all that we've been through. They tried to tell you I was not the boy fore you. They didn't like my hair, the clothes I love to wear. They didn't realize that I was strong enough for two. [Chorus]. I love you love, you love me too love, I love you love me love. I love you love my only true love, I love you love me love. The things they said about the two of us were lies. I know they couldn't see the love lights in our ours. They said I wouldn't dare, to show how much I care. They didn't know we were just two angels in disguise. [Chorus]. So here we are alone, we made it on our own. And though they tried they can't deny the way I really showed e'm. [Chorus: x2]. I love you love me love!Clint Holmes. Miscellaneous.

At the local dance at the local county jail. Well the band were playing and the booze began to flow. But the sound came over on the police car radio. Down at precinct 49. Having a tear-gas of a time. Sergeant Baker got a call from the Governor of the county jail. Load up, load up, load up. With rubber bullets. Load up, load up, load up. With rubber bullets. I love to hear those convicts squeal. It's a shame these slugs ain't real. But we can't have dancin' at the local county jail. Sergeant Baker and his men made a bee-line for the jail. And for miles around you could hear the sirens wail. There's a rumor goin' 'round death row. That a fuse is gonna blow. At the local hop at the local county jail. Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?. Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do?. Sergeant Baker started talkin' with a bullhorn in his hand. He was cool, he was clear, he was always in command. He said "Blood will flow here Padre. Padre you talk to your boys. Trust in me God will come to set you free". Well we don't understand why you called in the national guard. When uncle Sam is the one who belongs in the exercise yard. We all got balls and brains. But some's got balls and chains. At the local dance at the local county jail. Load up, load up, load up. With rubber bullets. Load up, load up, load up.

We've known each other since we were nine or ten. Together we climbed hills and trees. Learned of love and A, B, C's. Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees. Goodbye Emil, it's hard to die. When all the bird's are singing in the sky. Now that the spring is in the air. Pretty girls are everywhere. I wish we could both be there. We had joy, we had fun. We had seasons in the sun. But the hills we could climb. Were just seasons out of time. Goodbye Papa, please pray for me. I was the black sheep of the family. You tried to show me right from wrong. But too much wine and too much song. Wonder how I got along. Goodbye Papa, it's hard to die. When all the bird's are singing in the sky. Now that the spring is in the air. Little kids are everywhere. Think of me and I'll be there. We had joy, we had fun. We had seasons in the sun. But the wine and the song. Like the seasons have all gone. Goodbye Francoise, my trusted wife. Without you I'd had a lonely life. You cheated lots of times with them. But I forgave you in the end. Though your lover was my friend. Goodbye Francoise, it's hard to die. When all the birds are singing in the sky. Now that the spring is in the air. With your lovers everywhere. Just be careful, I'll be there. We had joy, we had fun. We had seasons in the sun. But the stars we could reach. Were just starfish on the beach. Goodbye Michelle, my little one. You gave me joy and helped me find the sun. And every time when I was down.

Back in the usa. Back in the bad old days. In the heat of a summer night. In the land of the dollar bill. When the town of chicago died. And they talk about it still. When a man named al capone. Tried to make that town his own. And he called his gang to war. Against the forces of the law. I heard my momma cry. I heard her pray the night chicago died. Brother, what a night it really was. Brother, what a fight it really was. Glory be. I heard my momma cry. I heard her pray the night chicago died. Brother, what a night the people saw. Brother, what a fight the people saw. Yes, indeed. And the sound of the battle rang. Through the streets of the old east side. 'til the last of the hoodlum gang. Had surrendered up or died. There was shouting in the street. And the sound of running feet. And i asked someone who said. 'bout a hundred cops are dead. I heard my momma cry. I heard her pray the night chicago died. Brother, what a night it really was.

And she's gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain. Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies. Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers. That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore. Waiting to take you away.

Neil Young. Lonfellow Serenade. Such were the plans I'd made. For she was a lady. And I was a dreamer. With only words to trade. You know that I was born for a night like this. Warmed by a stolen kiss. For I was lonely. And she was lonely. Ride, come on baby, ride. Let me make your dreams come true. I'll sing my song. Let me make it warm for you. I'll weave his web of rhyme. Upon the summer night. We'll leave this worldly time. On his winged flight. Then come, and as we lay. Beside this sleepy glade. There I will sing to you. My Longfellow serenade. Longfellow serenade. Such were the plans I made. But she was a lady. As deep as a river. And through the night, we stayed. And in my way, I loved her as none before. Loved her with words and more. For she was lonely. And I was lonely. Ride, come on baby, ride. Let me make you dreams come true. I'll sing my song. Let me sing my song. Let me make it warm for you. I'll weave this web of rhyme. Upon the summer night. We'll leave this worldly time. On his winged flight. Then come, and as we lay. Beside this sleepy glade. There I will sing to you. My Longfellow serenadeA boy is born. In hard time Mississippi. Surrounded by four walls. That ain't so pretty. His parents give. Him love and affection. To keep him strong. Moving in the right direction. Living just enough. Just enough for the city, ee ha. His father works. Some days for fourteen hours. And you can bet. He barely makes a dollar. His mother goes. To scrub the floors for many. And you'd best believe. She hardly gets a penny. Living just enough. Just enough for the city, yeah. His sister's black. But she is sho'nuff pretty. Her skirt is short. But Lord, her legs are sturdy. To walk to school. She's got to get up early. Her clothes are old. But never are they dirty. Living just enough. Just enough for the city, um hum. Her brother's smart. He's got more sense than many. His patience's long. But soon he won't have any. To find a job. Is like a haystack needle. 'Cause where he lives. They don't use colored people. Living just enough. Just enough for the city. Living just enough for the city, ohh. Living just enough for the city, ohh. Living just enough for the city, ohh. His hair is long. His feet are hard and gritty. He spends his life walking. The streets of New York City. He's almost dead. From breathing in air pollution. He tried to vote. But to him there's no solution. Living just enough. Just enough for the city. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hope you hear. Inside my voice of sorrow. And that it motivates you. To make a better tomorrow. This place is cruel. No where could be much colder. If we don't change. The world will soon be over. Living just enough. Stop giving. Just enough for the cityMy child arrived just the other day. He came to the world in the usual way. But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay. He learned to walk while I was away. And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it. And as he grew he'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, dad. You know I'm gonna be like you". And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon. Little Boy Blue and The Man In The Moon. "When you comin' home, Dad?". "I don't know when, we'll get together then, son. You know we'll have a good time then". Well my son turned 10 just the other day. Said, "Thanks for the ball Dad, come on let's play. Can you teach me to throw?" I said. "Not today, I got a lot to do", he said, "That's okay". And he walked away but a smile never came. He said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know I'm gonna be like him". And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon. Little Boy Blue and The Man In The Moon. "When you comin' home, Dad?". "I don't know when, we'll get together then, son. You know we'll have a good time then". Well he came from college just the other day. So much like a man I just had to say. "Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?". He shook his head, and he said with a smile. "What I'd really like dad, is to borrow the car keys. See you later, can I have them please?". And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon. Little Boy Blue and The Man In The Moon. "When you comin' home, son?". "I don't know when, we'll get together then. We're gonna have a good time then". Well I've long since retired, my son's moved away. Called him up just the other day. I said, "I'd like to see you, if you don't mind". He said, "I'd love to Dad, if I can find the time. You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu. But it's sure nice talking to you Dad, it's been sure nice talking to you". And as he hung up the phone it occurred to me. He'd grown up just like, my boy was just like me. And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon. Little Boy Blue and The Man In The Moon. "When you comin' home, son?". "I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad. We're gonna have a good time then"If I leave here tomorrow. Would you still remember me?. For I must be traveling on, now. 'Cause there's too many places. I've got to see. But, if I stayed here with you, girl. Things just couldn't be the same. 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now. And this bird, you'll can not change. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. And the bird you cannot change. And this bird you cannot change. Lord knows, I can't change. Bye, bye, baby it's been a sweet love. Yeah, yeah. Though this feeling I can't change. But please don't take it so badly. 'Cause the Lord knows. I'm to blame. But, if I stayed here with you girl. Things just couldn't be the same. 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now. And this bird, you'll can not change. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. And this bird you cannot change. And this bird you cannot change. Lord knows, I can't change.

We've gotta hold this piece of ground. I need a volunteer to ride out. And bring us back some extra men. And Billy's hand was up in a moment. Forgettin' all the words she said, she said. Billy don't be a hero, don't be a fool with your life. Billy don't be a hero, come back and make me your wife. And as Billy started to go, she said keep your pretty head low. Billy don't be a hero, come back to me. I heard his fiancee got a letter. That told how Billy died that day. The letter said he was a hero. She should be proud he died that way.

It'll be lonely this Christmas. Lonely and cold.. It'll be cold so cold. without you to hold. This Christmas. You remember last year, when you and I were together. We never thought there'd be an end.

Merry Christmas darlin', wherever you are.You live your life in the songs you hear. On the rock and roll radio. And when a young girl doesn't have any friends. that's a really nice place to go. Folks hoping you'd turn out cool. But they had to take you out of school. You're a little touched you know, Angie baby. Lovers appear in your room each night. And they whirl you across the floor. But they always seem to fade away. When your Daddy taps on your door. Angie girl, are you all right?. Tell the radio goodnight. All alone once more, Angie baby. Angie Baby, you're a special lady. Living in a world of make-believe. Well, maybe. Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy. With evil on his mind. 'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room. At night through the window blind. I see your folks have gone away. Would you dance with me today?. I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie baby. When he walks in the room, he feels confused. Like he's walked into a play. And the music's so loud it spins him around. 'Til his soul has lost it's way. And as she turns the volume down. He's getting smaller with the sound. It seems to pull him off the ground. Toward the radio he's bound never to be found. The headlines read that a boy disappeared. And everyone thinks he died. 'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover. Who keeps her satisfied. It's so nice to be insane. No one asks you to explain. Radio by your side, Angie baby. Angie Baby, you're a special lady. Living in a world of make-believe. Well, maybe, well, maybe, well maybeShe may be the face I can't forget. A trace of pleasure or regret. May be my treasure or. The price I have to pay.. She may be the song that summer sings. May be the chill that autumn brings. May be a hundred different things. Within the measure of a day.. She may be the beauty or the beast. May be the famine or the feast. May turn each day into a. Heaven or a hell.. She may be the mirror of my dream. A smile reflected in a stream. She may not be what she may seem. Inside her shell.. She who always seems so happy in a crowd. Whose eyes can be so private and so proud. No one's allowed to see them. When they cry.. She may be the love that cannot hope to last. May come to me from shadows of the past. That I remember till the day I die.. She may be the reason I survive. The why and wherefore I'm alive. The one I'll care for through the. Rough and rainy years.. Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears. And make them all my souvenirs. For where she goes I've got to be.. The meaning of my life is she, she, she.Midnight at the oasis. Send your camel to bed. Shadows paintin' our faces. Traces of romance in our heads. Heaven's holdin' a half-moon. Shinin' just for us. Let's slip off to a sand dune. Real soon and kick up a little dust. Come on, Cactus is our friend. He'll point out the way. Come on, till the evenin' ends. Till the evenin' ends. You don't have to answer. There's no need to speak. I'll be your belly dancer. Prancer and you can be my sheik. I know your daddy's a sultan. A nomad known to all. With fifty girls to attend him, they all send him. Jump at his beck and call. But you won't need no harem, honey.

There's a girl, she's waiting for me. Cross over the river, beyond every cloud. She's passed the wind that's blowing loud. Over the mountain, a girl waits for me. Tell all the sands and every blade of grass. Please tell the wind to let my love pass. Over the mountain, a girl waits for meDolly Parton. Greatest Hits. Jolene. Jolene, jolene, jolene, jolene.

Click highlighted lyrics to see their meaning. How you doin' out there y'ever seem to have one of those days. Where it just seems like everybody's gettin' on your case. From your teacher all the way down to your best girlfriend. Well, y'know, I used to have 'em just about all the time. But I found a way to get out of 'em let me tell you about it. Sitting in the classroom thinking it's a drag. Listening to the teacher rap just ain't my bag. The noon bells ring you know that's my cue. I'm gonna meet the boys on floor number two. Smokin' in the boys room. Smokin' in the boys room. Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules. But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school. A-checkin' out the halls makin' sure the coast is clear. Lookin' in the stalls, no, there ain't nobody here. Oh, my buddy Fang, and me and Paul. To get caught would surely be the death of us all. Smokin' in the boys room, yeah. Smokin' in the boys room. Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules. But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school. All right. Oh, put me to work in the school book store. Check out counter and I got bored. Teacher was lookin' for me all around. Two hours later you know where I was found. Smokin' in the boys room, yes indeed. I was smokin' in the boys room. Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules. But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school. One mo'. Smokin' in the boys room. Oh, smokin' in the boys room. Now, teacher, I am fully aware of the rules. But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in schoolI remember when Mary Lou said. 'You wanna walk me home from school'. And I said, 'Yes, I do'. She said, 'I don't have to go right home. And I'm the kind that likes to be alone. As long as you would'. I said, 'Me, too'. And so we took a stroll. Wound up down by the swimmin' hole. And she said, 'Do what you want to do'. I got silly and I found a frog. In the water by a hollow log. And I shook it at her. And I said 'This frog's for you'. She said.... Chorus:. 'I don't like spiders and snakes. And that ain't what it takes to love me. You fool, you fool. I don't like spiders and snakes. And that ain't what it takes to love me. Like I want to be loved by you'. Well, I think of that girl from time to time. I call her up when I got a dime. I say, "Hello, baby'. She says, 'Ain't you cool'. I say, 'Do you remember when?. And would you like to get together again?'. She says, 'I'll see you after school'. I was shy and so for a while. Most of my love was touch and smile. Til she said, 'Come on over here'. I was nervous as you might guess. Still looking for somethin' to slip down her dress. And she said, 'Let's make it perfectly clear'. She said...Zoo time is 'she and you' time. The mammals are your favorite type, and you want her tonight. Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat. You hear the thunder of stampeding rhinos, elephants and tacky tigers. This town ain't big enough for the both of us. And it ain't me who's gonna leave. Flying, domestic flying. And when the stewardess is near, do not show any fear. Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat. You are a khaki-colored bombardier, it's Hiroshima that you're nearing. This town ain't big enough for the both of us. And it ain't me who's gonna leave. Daily, except for Sunday. You dawdle in to the cafe where you meet her each day. Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat. As twenty cannibals have hold of you, they need their protein. Just like you do. This town ain't big enough for the both of us. And it ain't me who's gonna leave. Shower, another shower. You've got to look your best for her and be clean everywhere. Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat. The rain is pouring on the foreign town, the bullets cannot cut you down. This town ain't big enough for the both of us. And it ain't me who's gonna leave. Choosing, the girl is choosing. Between the man who's [Incomprehensible] is you. Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat. There is a [Incomprehensible]. This town ain't big enough for the both of us. And it ain't me who's gonna leave. Shower, another shower. You've got to look your best for her and be clean everywhere. Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat. The rain is pouring on the foreign town, the bullets cannot cut you down. This town ain't big enough for the both of us. And it ain't me who's gonna leave. This town ain't big enough. This town ain't big enough. This town ain't big enough. This town ain't big enough. This town ain't big enough. This town ain't big enough. Census, the latest census. There'll be more girls who live in town though not enough to go around. Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat. You know that. This town isn't big enough, not big enough for the both of us. This town isn't big enough, not big enough for the both of us. I ain't gonna leave. Everyday when I'm away. I'm thinking of you. Everyone can carry on. Except for we two.. . And you know that our love. And you know that I. And you know that our love won't die.. . And it won't even show. And no-one will know. One little wave. To say you'll behave. It won't even show. How far love can go.. . Everyday when I'm away. And there's been a few. Every land I need a hand. To help me come through.. . And you know that our love.

And they whispered into your brain they set you on the treadmill and they made you change your name. And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never knowing (a-a-a-h...) who to cling to when the rain set in. I would (ah... ah-ah-ah) have liked to know you but I was just a kid. Your candle burned out. (ah-ah-ah-ah...) long before your legend ever did. Loneliness was tough toughest role you ever played. Hollywood created a superstar and pain was the price you paid. Even when you died oh the press still hounded you all the papers had to say was that Marilyn was found in the nude. And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never knowing (a-a-a-h...) who to cling to when the rain set in. I would have (ah... ah-ah-ah) liked to know you but I was just a kid. Your candle burned out. (ah-ah-ah-ah...) long before your legend ever did. Goodbye Norma Jean. Though I never knew you at all you had the grace to hold yourself. While those around you crawled. (ooh...) Goodbye Norma Jean. From the young man in the twenty second row. Who sees you (ooh-ooh-ooh...) as something more than sexual. More than just our Marilyn Monroe. (ah-ah-ah-ah...) And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never knowing (a-a-a-h...) who to cling to when the rain set in. I would (ah...) have liked to know you (ah-ah-ah...) but I was just a kid. Your candle burned out. (ah-ah-ah-ah...) long before your legend ever did. Your candle burned out. (ah-ah-ah-ah...) long before your legend ever didThese are the eyes that never knew how to smile. Till you came into my life. And these are the arms that long to lock you inside. Every day and every night. . Girl, and here is the soul of which you've taken control. Can't you see I'm tryin' to show love is right. . Oh show and tell just a game I play. When I wanna say, "I love you". Girl, so show me and tell me. That you feel the same way too. Say you do, baby. . These are the hands that can't help reaching for you. If you're anywhere in sight. And these are the lips that can't help callin' your name. In the middle of the night. . Oh, and here is the man who needs to know where you stand. Don't you know I've done all I can, so decide. . Oh show and tell just a game I play. When I wanna say, "I love you". Girl, so show me and tell me. That you feel the same way too. Say you do, say you do, baby, baby, baby. . Ah, here is the soul of which you've taken control. Can't you see I'm tryin' to show love is right. . Ooh, girl, show and tell just a game I play. When I wanna say, "Oh, I love you". Girl, so show me and tell me. That you feel the same way too. Say you do, say you do, baby. . Oh show and tell just a game I play. When I wanna say, "Oh, I love you". Girl, so show me and tell me. That you feel the same way tooLook out the left the captain said. The lights down there. That's where we'll land. Saw a falling star burnin'. High above the Las Vagas sand. It wasn't the one that you gave to me. That night down south between the trailer. Not the early one that you can wish upon. Not the northern one that guides in the sailors. Star bright, star bright. You've got the loving that I like. Turn this crazy bird around. Should not have got on this flight tonight. You got the touch so gentle and sweet. But you've got that look so critical. Can't talk to you baby you know I get so weak. Sometimes I think love is just mythical. Up there's a heaven, down there's a town. Blackness everywhere and little lights shine. Blackness, blackness dragging me down. Come on light the candle in this heart of mine. Star bright, star bright. You've got the loving that I like. Turn this crazy bird around. Should not have got on this flight tonight. I'm drinking sweet champagne. Got the headphones up high. Can't numb you, can't drum you out of my mind. And singing, "Goodbye baby, baby goodbye. Ooh, ooh, love is blind". Up go the flaps down go the wheels. Hope you got your heat turned on baby. Hope they finally fixed your automobile. Hope it's better when we meet again, baby. Star bright, star bright. You've got the loving that I like. Turn this crazy bird around. Should not have got on this flight tonight. Should not have got on this flight tonightWhere were you in sixty-eight. In sixty-eight, Julie was Johnnie's date. Two kids growin' together. Livin' each day as if time was slippin' away. Oh, they were just sixteen and their love, a teenage dream. They passed the time, they crossed the line. The line that ran between. Julie and Johnnie, now you've made it. But life goes on, you know it ain't easy. You've just gotta be strong if you're one of the six teens. And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy. You know you'll never go wrong 'cause you're all part of the six teens. Suzie and Davey got to make the big time. Maybe they can put it all together. In a show that lasts forever. Oh, they would walk the strip at nights. And dream they saw their name in lights. On Desolation Boulevard, they'll light the faded light. Suzie and Davey, you can make it. But life goes on, you know it ain't easy. You've just gotta be strong if you're one of the six teens. And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy. You know you'll never go wrong 'cause you're all part of the six teens. So where were you in sixty-eight. When Bobby and Billy thought that sixty eight was out of date?. They took the flowers from their hair. And tried to make us all aware, too bad, too late. So they lived from day to day. And tried to do it all their way. But sixty-eight was sixty-eight. No matter what they say. Bobby and Billy, maybe you'll make it one day. But life goes on, you know it ain't easy. You've just gotta be strong if you're one of the six teens. And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy. You know you'll never go wrong 'cause you're all. And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy. You know you'll never go wrong 'cause you're all part of the six teens. And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy. You know you'll never go wrong 'cause you're all part of the six teensOh very young. What will you leave us this time?. You're only dancing on this earth for a short while. And though your dreams may toss and turn you now. They will vanish away like your daddy's best jeans. Denim blue fading up to the sky. And though you want them to last forever. You know they never will, you know they never will. And the patches make the goodbye harder still. Oh very young. What will you leave us this time?. There'll never be a better chance to change your mind. And if you want this world to see a better day. Will you carry the words of love with you?. Will you ride the great white bird into heaven?. And though you want to last forever. You know you never will, you know you never will. And the goodbye makes the journey harder still. Will you carry the word of love with you. Will you ride? Will you ride? Will you ride? Oh. Oh very young. What will you leave us this time?. You're only dancing on this earth for a short while. Oh very young. What will you leave us this time?Lift me, won't you lift me above the old routine?. Make it nice, play it clean, Jazzman. When the Jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes. He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees. It's a gospel kind of feelin', a touch of Georgia slide. A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified. Jazzman, take my blues away. Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play. Jazzman, oh Jazzman. When the Jazzman's signifyin' and the band is windin' low. It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul. He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears. He can cry like a fallen Angel when the risin' time is near. Jazzman, take my blues away. Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play. Jazzman, oh Jazzman. Oh lift me, won't you lift me with every turn around?. Play it sweetly, take me down, oh JazzmanHmmm, hmmm. Yeah. Oh Baby, hmmm. Hang on in there, baby. (Give me love tonight). Don't be afraid, baby, ooooh.

Where hustle's the name of the game. And nice guys get washed away. Like the snow and the rain. There's been a load of compromisin'. On the road to my horizon. But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me. Like a rhinestone cowboy. Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo. Like a rhinestone cowboy. Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know. And offers comin' over the phone. Well, I really don't mind the rain. And a smile can hide all the pain. But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way. And I dream of the things I'll do. With a subway token. And a dollar tucked inside my shoe. There'll be a load of compromisin'. On the road to my horizon. But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me. Like a rhinestone cowboy. Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo.

What turns on your lights. The full moon is calling, the fever is high. And the wicked wind whispers and moans. You got your demons, you got desires. Well, I got a few of my own. Ooo, someone to be kind to. In between the dark and the light. Ooo, coming right behind you. Swear I'm gonna find you. One of these nights. One of these dreams. One of these lost and lonely dreams now. We're gonna find one. One that really screams. I've been searching for the daughter of the Devil himself. I've been searching for an Angel in white. I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both. And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight. Ooo, loneliness will blind you. In between the wrong and the right. Ooo, coming right behind you.

(One of these nights)In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American dream. At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines. Sprung from cages out on Highway 9. Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and stepping out over the line. Baby, this town rips the bones from your back. It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap. We got to get out while we're young. Because tramps like us, baby we were born to run. . Wendy let me in, I want to be your friend. I want to guard your dreams and visions. Just wrap your legs around these velvet rims . And strap your hands across my engines. Together we could break this trap. We'll run until we drop, baby we'll never go back. Will you walk with me out on the wire. Because baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider. But I got to find out how it feels. I want to know if love is wild. Girl, I want to know if love is real. . Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard. The girls comb their hair in rear-view mirrors. And the boys try to look so hard. The amusement park rises bold and stark. Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist. I want to die with you Wendy on the streets tonight. In an everlasting kiss. . The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive. Everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide. Together Wendy, we can live with the sadness. I'll love you with all the madness in my soul. Someday girl I don't know when we're going to get to that place. Where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun. But until then tramps like us, baby we were born to runNo, woman no cry. No, woman no cry. No, woman no cry. No, woman no cry. Said, said, said I remember when we used to sit. In the government yard in Trenchtown. Ob-observing the hypocrites. As they would mingle with the good people we meet (meet). Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost. Along the way (way). In this great future, you can't forget your past. So dry your tears, I say. And no, woman, no cry. No, woman, no cry. Dear, little darlin', don't shed no tears. No, woman, no cry. Said, said, said I remember when we used to sit. In the government yard in Trenchtown. And then Georgie would make the fire light. As it was logwood burnin' through the night (night). Then we would cook cornmeal porridge. Of which I'll share with you (ooh). My feet is my only carriage. So I've got to push on through. But while I'm gone, I mean. Everything's gonna be all right. Everything's gonna be all right.

I gave you love. I thought that we had made it to the top. I gave you all I had to give. Why did it have to stop. You've blown it all sky high. By telling me a lie. Without a reason why. You've blown it all sky high. You, you've blown it all sky high. Our love had wings to fly. We could have touched the sky. You've blown it all sky high. Up round I've flown. Then down down like a stone. I gave you loveWhen I think of those East End lights, muggy nights. The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs. Prima Donna Lord you really should have been there. Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair. And it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymore. We've all gone crazy lately. My friends out there rollin' round the basement floor. And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear. You almost had your hooks in me didn't you dear. You nearly had me roped and tied. Altar bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear. You're a butterfly and butterflies are free to fly. Fly away, high away, bye bye. Never realized the passin' hours of evenin' showers. A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams. I'm strangled by your haunted social scene. Just a pawn out played by a dominating queen. It's four o'clock in the mornin', damn it listen to me good. I'm sleepin' with myself tonight. Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive. And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear. You almost had your hooks in me didn't you dear. You nearly had me roped and tied. Altar bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear. You're a butterfly and butterflies are free to fly. Fly away, high away, bye bye. And I would have walked head on to the deep end of the river. Clinging to your stocks and bonds, paying your H.P. demands forever. Comin' in the mornin' with a truck to take me home. Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight. Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight. Someone saved my life tonight. So save your strength and run the field you play alone. And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear. You almost had your hooks in me didn't you dear. You nearly had me roped and tied. Altar bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear. You're a butterfly and butterflies are free to fly. Fly away, high away, bye bye. Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight. Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight. Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight. ...Ladies and Gentlemen, this is captain Tobias Wilcock welcoming you aboard Coconut Airways flight 372 to Bridgetown Barbados.

To my land full of rainy skies and gales. And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow. Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell. For you are beautiful. And I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tell. For you are beautiful. And I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tell. I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing. And the taste of war I know so very well. Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising. Their guns on fire as we sail into hell. I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow. But how bitter will be this last farewell. For you are beautiful. And I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tell. For you are beautiful. And I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tell. Though death and darkness gather all about me. And my ship be torn apart upon the sea. I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands. In the heaving waves that brought me once to thee. And should I return safe home again to England. I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale. For you are beautiful. And I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tell. For you are beautiful. And I have loved you dearly. More dearly than the spoken word can tellFeeling better, now that we're through. Feeling better 'cause I'm over you. I learned my lesson, it left a scar. Now I see how you really are. You're no good.

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway. Singin' them love songsI learned the truth at seventeen. That love was meant for beauty queens. And high school girls with clear skinned smiles. Who married young and then retired.. The valentines I never knew. The Friday night charades of youth. Were spent on one more beautiful. At seventeen I learned the truth. And those of us with ravaged faces. Lacking in the social graces. Desperately remained at home. Inventing lovers on the phone. Who called to say come dance with me. and murmured vague obscenities. It isn't all it seems. At seventeen. A brown eyed girl in hand me downs. Whose name I never could pronounce. Said, "Pity please the ones who serve,. They only get what they deserve". The rich relationed hometown queen. Marries into what she needs. With a guarantee of company. And haven for the elderly. Remember those who win the game. Lose the love they sought to gain. Indebentures of quality. And dubious integrity. Their small town eyes will gape at you. In dull surprise when payment due. Exceeds accounts received. At seventeen. To those of us who know the pain. of valentines that never came. And those whose names were never called. When choosing sides for basketball. It was long ago and far away. The world was younger than today. And dreams were all they gave for free. To ugly duckling girls like me. We all play the game and when we dare. To cheat ourselves at solitaire. Inventing lovers on the phone. Repenting other lives unknown. That call and say, come dance with me. and murmur vague obscenities. At ugly girls like me. At seventeenIt could've been me but it was you. Who went and bit off a little bit more than he could chew. You said that you had it made, but you been had. The woman no good, no how, thinkin' maybe the blood is bad. Bad blood. (Bad blood). The woman was born to lie. Makes promises she can't keep. With the wink on an eye. Bad blood. (Bad blood). Brother, you've been deceived. It's bound to change you mind. About all you believe. From where I stand, it looks mighty strange. How you let a woman like that treat you like small change. I don't understand what you're lookin' to find. The only thing bad blood do is mess up a good man's mind. Hear me talkin' now. Bad blood. (Bad blood). The bitch is in her smile. The lie is on her lips. Such an evil child. Bad blood. (Bad blood). Is takin' you for a ride. The only thing good about bad blood. Is lettin' it slide. Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron. Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron. Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron. Bad blood, talkin' 'bout bad blood. Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron. Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron. Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron. Bad blood. Here we go. Bad blood. (Bad blood). The bitch is in her smile. The lie is on her lips. Such an evil child. Bad blood. (Bad blood). Is takin' you for a ride. The only thing good about bad blood. Is lettin' it slide. The only thing good about bad blood. Is lettin' it slideMy love must be a kind of blind love. I can't see anyone but you. . Are the stars out tonight?. I don't know if it's cloudy or bright. I only have eyes for you, dear. .

Take a little trip, take a little trip. Take a little trip with meShe comes down from yellow mountain. On a dark flat land she rides. On a pony she named Wildfire. With a whirlwind by her side. On a cold Nebraska night. They say she died one winter. When there came a killing frost. And the pony she named Wildfire. Busted down his stall. In a blizzard he was lost. Ran calling Wildfire. She ran calling Wildfire. Calling Wildfire. So, by the dark of the moon I planted. But there came an early snow. There's been an old hoot owl howling. Outside my window now, six nights in a row.

(All night). She wants the young American. (Young American, young American). (She wants the young American). (All right). She wants the young American. All the way from Washington.

Blue skies from pain.. Can you tell a green field. From a cold steel rail?. A smile from a veil?. Do you think you can tell?. Did they get you to trade. Your heroes for ghosts?. Hot ashes for trees?. Hot air for a cool breeze?. Cold comfort for change?. And did you exchange. A walk on part in the war. For a lead role in a cage?. How I wish, how I wish you were here.. We're just two lost souls. Swimming in a fish bowl. Year after year. Running over the same old ground.. What have we found. The same old fears.. Wish you were here.Ozark Mountain Daredevils. It'll Shine When It Shines.

Everyone must face their share of loneliness. In my own time nobody knew. The pain I was goin' through. And waitin' was all my heart could do. . Hope was all I had until you came. Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me. You were the dawn breaking the night. The promise of morning light. Filling the world surrounding me . When I hold you. . Baby, baby, feels like maybe, things will be all right. Baby, baby, your love's made me. Free as a song, singin' forever. . Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely. You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me. Tomorrow maybe even brighter than today. Sinc I threw my sadness away. Only yesterday. . I have found my home here in your arms. Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be. Life waits for us, share it with me. The best is about to be. So much is left for us to see . When I hold you. . Baby, baby, feels like maybe, things will be all right. Baby, baby, your love's made me. Free as a song, singin' forever. . Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely.

Stay with me, don't go. Talk with me for just a while. So much of you to get to know. Reaching out touching you. Leaving all the worries far behind. Loving you the way I do. My mouth on yours and yours on mine. Marry me, let me live with you. Nothing is wrong and love is right. Like a man said in his song. "Help me make it through the night". Loneliness can get you down. When you get to thinkin' no one cares. Lean on me. (And I'll lean on you). Together we will see it through. No, I don't like to sleep alone. It's sad to think some folks do. No, I don't like to sleep alone. No one does do you. (I don't like to sleep alone). No one does do youTo sail on a dream. On a crystal clear ocean. To ride on the crest. Of a wild raging storm. To work in the service. Of life and the living. In search of the answers. To questions unknown. To be part of the movement. Part of the growing. Part of beginning. To understand.

They were closer now Fernando. Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally. I was so afraid Fernando, we were young and full of life. And none of us prepared to die and I'm not ashamed to say. The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry. There was something in the air that night, the stars were bright, Fernando. They were shining there for you and me for liberty, Fernando. Though we never thought that we could lose, there's no regret. If I had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando. If I had to do the same again, I would my friend, Fernando.

Here comes the story of the Hurricane. The man the authorities came to blame For somethin' that he never done. Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been. The champion of the world. Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously. "I didn't do it," he says, and he throws up his hands. "I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand.. I saw them leavin'," he says, and he stops. "One of us had better call up the cops" And so Patty calls the cops. And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'. In the hot New Jersey night. Meanwhile, far away in another part of town. Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around. Number one contender for the middleweight crown. Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down. When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road. Just like the time before and the time before that. In Paterson that's just the way things go If you're black you might as well not show up on the street. 'Less you wanna draw the heat. Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops. Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around. He said, "I saw two men runnin' out, they looked likemiddleweights. They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates". And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head Cop said: "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead". So they took him to the infirmary. And though this man could hardly see. They told him that he could identify the guilty men. Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in. Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs. The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye. Says, "Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!". Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane. The man the authorities came to blame. For somethin' that he never done. Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been. The champion of the world. Four months later, the ghettos are in flame. Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name. While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game. And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame.. "Remember that murder that happened in a bar?". "Remember you said you saw the getaway car?". "You think you'd like to play ball with the law?". "Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?". "Don't forget that you are white". Arthur Dexter Bradley said:"I'm really not sure". Cops said:"A poor boy like you could use a break. We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello. Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.. You'll be doin' society a favor. That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.. We want to put his ass in stir. We want to pin this triple murder on him. He ain't no gentleman jim". Rubin could take a man out with just one punch. But he never did like to talk about it all that much It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay. And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way. Up to some paradise. Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice. And ride a horse along a trail. But then they took him to the jail house. Where they try to turn a man into a mouse. All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance. The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance. The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums. To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum. And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger. No one doubted that he pulled the trigger. And though they could not produce the gun. The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed. And the all-white jury agreed. Rubin Carter was falsely tried. The crime was murder "one," guess who testified?. Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied. And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.. How can the life of such a man. Be in the palm of some fool's hand?. To see him obviously framed. Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land. Where justice is a game. Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties. Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise. While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell. An innocent man in a living hell. That's the story of the Hurricane. But it won't be over till they clear his name And give him back the time he's done.. Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been. The champion of the worldI must have been through about a million girls. I'd love 'em and I'd leave 'em alone. I didn't care how much they cried, no sir. Their tears left me cold as a stone. But then I fooled around and fell in love. I fooled around and fell in love. I fooled around and fell in love. I fooled around and fell in love. It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked. I'd get out my book and write down her name. But when the grass got a little greener on the other side. I'd just tear out that page. But then I fooled around and fell in love. I fooled around and fell in love. Since I met you baby. I fooled around and fell in love. I fooled around and fell in love. Free, on my own that's the way I used to be. But since I met you baby love's got a hold on me. Ooh it's got a hold on me now, hey. I can't let go of you baby. I can't stop lovin' you now, hey. 'Cause I fooled around, fooled around, fooled around. Fooled around, fooled around, fooled around, fell in love. Fooled around, fooled around, yes I did.

I'd do anything for you, your wish is my command. I could move a mountain when your hand is in my hand. Words cannot express how much you mean to me. There must be some other way to make you see. If it takes my heart and soul you know I'd pay the price. Everything that I possess I'd gladly sacrifice. Oh, you to me are everything. The sweetest song that I could sing. Oh baby, oh baby.

And the bright lights have faded to blue. I was thinking 'bout a woman. Who might have loved me, and I never knew. You know I've always been a dreamer. (Spent my life running 'round). And it's so hard to change. (Can't seem to settle down). But the dreams I've seen lately. Keep on turning out and burning out. And turning out the same. So put me on a highway. And show me a sign. And take it to the limit one more time. You can spend all your time making money. You can spend all your love making time. If it all fell to pieces tomorrow. Would you still be mine?. And when you're looking for your freedom. (Nobody seems to care). And you can't find the door. (Can't find it anywhere). When there's nothing to believe in. Still you're coming back, you're running back. You're coming back for more. So put me on a highway. And show me a sign. And take it to the limit one more time. Take it to the limit.

All those people gathered there (In Zaïre, in Zaïre) to see the rumble in the jungle there (There (There)). (In Zaïre). Came a man called elijan (In Zaïre, in Zaïre). With him came the superstar (In Zaïre, in Zaïre). All those people came from far (In Zaïre, in Zaïre) to see the rumble in the jungle there (There (There)). (In Zaïre). And who was the victor in the night?. Elijah Mohammed's boy, Ali won the fight (Fight (Fight)). All those people chanted there (In Zaïre, in Zaïre). Seven rounds of torture there (In Zaïre, in Zaïre). One more round and Ali's there (In Zaïre, in Zaïre). There was great excitement everywhere (Where (Where)). (In Zaïre). The lightning struck twice in the night. First in the ring and then after the fight (Fight (Fight)). (In Zaïre, in Zaïre). (In Zaïre, in Zaïre). (In Zaïre, in Zaïre). (In Zaïre, in Zaïre).

(In Zaïre, in Zaïre)The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down. Of the big lake they called 'Gitche Gumee'. The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead. When the skies of November turn gloomy. With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more. Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty. That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed. When the gales of November came early. The ship was the pride of the American side. Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin. As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most. With a crew and good captain well seasoned. Concluding some terms with a couple steel firms. When they left fully loaded for Cleveland. And later that night when the ship's bell rang. Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?. The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound. When a wave broke over the railing. And every man knew, as the captain did too. T'was the witch of November come stealin'. The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait. When the gales of November came slashin'. When afternoon came it was freezin' rain. In the face of a hurricane west wind. When supper time came, the old cook came on deck sayin'. Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya. At seven pm a main hatchway caved in, he said. Fellas, it's been good t'know ya. The captain wired in he had water comin' in. And the good ship and crew was in peril. And later that night when his lights went outta sight. Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. Does any one know where the love of God goes. When the waves turn the minutes to hours?. The searches all say they'd have made whitefish bay. If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her. They might have split up or they might have capsized. They may have broke deep and took water. And all that remains is the faces and the names. Of the wives and the sons and the daughters. Lake Huron rolls, superior sings. In the rooms of her ice-water mansion. Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams. The islands and bays are for sportsmen. And farther below lake Ontario. Takes in what lake Erie can send her. The iron boats go as the mariners all know. With the gales of November remembered. In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed. In the maritime sailors' cathedral. The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times. For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald. The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down. Of the big lake they call 'Gitche Gumee'. Superior, they said, never gives up her dead. When the gales of November come earlyBaby hair with a woman's eyes. I can feel you're watching in the night.

(harrison). . And now the marriage vow is very sacred. The man has put us together now. You ought to make it stick together. Come on, come on, let's stick together. You know we made a vow to leave one another never. But now you never miss your water 'til your well runs dry. Come on now baby give our love a try.

How can it be happy without its ma and pa. Let´s stick together, c´mon c´mon let´s stick together. You know we made a vow to leave one another neverShe came on like the night and she held on tight. And the world was right when she made love to me, we were free. She moved in like a friend, started loving me. And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms. But the morning when I woke up, I was here and she was gone. Now I'm hanging on, maybe you can tell me. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong?. Where did she go when I need her close to me. And the perfect story ended at the start. I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart. Now I'm hanging on, on the chance that you'll come back to me. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?. I could take it in my stride, start living for the moment. Maybe half the things we sought were never there. Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size. It isn't really fair. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?. How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling?On a dark desert highway. Cool wind in my hair. Warm smell of colitas. Rising up through the air. Up ahead in the distance. I saw a shimmering light. My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim. I had to stop for the night. There she stood in the doorway. I heard the mission bell. And I was thinking to myself:. "This could be heaven or this could be hell". Then she lit up a candle. And she showed me the way. There were voices down the corridor. I thought I heard them say. Welcome to the Hotel California. Such a lovely place (such a lovely place). Such a lovely face. Plenty of room at the Hotel California. Any time of year (any time of year). You can find it here. Her mind is Tiffany-twisted. She got the Mercedes bends. She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends. How they dance in the courtyard. Sweet summer sweat. Some dance to remember. Some dance to forget. So I called up the Captain:. "Please bring me my wine". He said: "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969". And still those voices are calling from far away. Wake you up in the middle of the night. Just to hear them say. Welcome to the Hotel California. Such a lovely place (such a lovely place). Such a lovely face. They're living it up at the Hotel California. What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise). Bring your alibis. Mirrors on the ceiling. The pink champagne on ice. And she said: "We are all just prisoners here of our own device". And in the master's chambers. They gathered for the feast. They stab it with their steely knives. But they just can't kill the beast. Last thing I remember. I was running for the door. I had to find the passage back. To the place I was before. "Relax," said the night man. "We are programmed to receive. You can check out any time you like. But you can never leave"I know your eyes in the morning sun. I feel you touch me in the pouring rain. And the moment that you wander far from me. I wanna feel you in my arms again. And you come to me on a summer breeze. Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave. And it's me you need to show. How deep is your love. How deep is your love, how deep is your love. I really mean to learn. 'Cause we're living in a world of fools. Breaking us down when they all should let us be. We belong to you and me. I believe in you. You know the door to my very soul. You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour. You're my savior when I fall. And you may not think, I care for you.

I was always certain love would grow. Love ageless and evergreen. Seldom seen by two. You and I will make each night a first. Every day a beginning. Spirits rise and their dance I unrehearsed. They warm and excite us. 'Cause we have the brightest love. Two lights that shine as one. Morning glory and midnight sun. Time we've learned to sail above. Time won't change the meaning of one love.

She said "I suppose you've heard, 'bout Alice". So I rushed to the window and I looked outside. And I could hardly believe my eyes. As a big limousine rode up into Alice's drive.. Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go. I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know. 'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice. Twenty-four years just waitin' for a chance. To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance. Now I gotta get used to not living next door to Alice. We grew up together, two kids in the park. Carved out initials deep in the bark, me and Alice. Now she walks through the door, with her head held high. Just for a moment I caught her eye. As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive. Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go. I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know. 'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice. Twenty-four years just waitin' for a chance. To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance. Now I gotta get used to not living next door to Alice. Sally called back, and asked how I felt. She said, "I know how to help, get over Alice". She said, "Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here. You know I've been waiting twenty-four years...". And the big limousine disappeared. I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go. I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know. 'Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice. Twenty-four years just waitin' for a chance. To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance. But I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice. Now, I'll never get used to not living next door to AliceIt won't be easy, you'll think it strange. When I try to explain how I feel. That I still need your love after all that I've done. You won't believe me. All you will see is a girl you once knew. Although she's dressed up to the nines. At sixes and sevens with you. I had to let it happen, I had to change. Couldn't stay all my life down at heel. Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun. So I chose freedom. Running around, trying everything new. But nothing impressed me at all. I never expected it to. Don't cry for me Argentina. The truth is I never left you. All through my wild days. My mad existence, I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance. And as for fortune and as for fame. I never invited them in. Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired. They are illusions. They're not the solutions they promised to be. The answer was here all the time. I love you and hope you love me. Don't cry for me Argentina. Don't cry for me Argentina. The truth is I never left you. All through my wild days. My mad existence, I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance. Have I said too much. There's nothing more I can think of to say to you. But all you have to do is look at me to know.

Though sometimes I wish someone could. Nobody does it quite the way you do. Why'd you have to be so good?. The way that you hold me whenever you hold me. There's some kind of magic inside you. That keeps me from runnin', but just keep it comin'. How'd you learn to do the things you do?. And nobody does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest. Nobody does it half as good as you. Baby, baby, darling, you're the best. Baby, you're the best. Baby, you're the best. Baby, you're the best. ...I didn't know what day it was. When you walked into the room. I said hello unnoticed. You said goodbye too soon. Breezing through the clientele. Spinning yarns that were so lyrical. I really must confess right here. The attraction was purely physical. I took all those habits of yours. That in the beginning were hard to accept. Your fashion sense, beardsly prints. I put down to experience. The big bosomed lady with the dutch accent. Who tried to change my point of view. Her ad-lib lines were well rehearsed. But my heart cried out for you. You're in my heart, you're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover, you're my best friend. You're in my soul. My love for you is immeasurable. My respect for you immense. You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness. You're beauty and elegance. You're a rhapsody, a comedy. You're a symphony and a play. You're every love song ever written. But honey, what do you see in me?. You're in my heart, you're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover, you're my best friend. You're in my soul. You're an essay in glamor. Please pardon the grammar. But you're every schoolboy's dream. You're Celtic, united, but baby I've decided. You're the best team I've ever seen. And there have been many affairs. Many times I've thought to leave. But I bite my lip and turn around. 'Cause you're the warmest thing I've ever found. You're in my heart, you're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover, you're my best friend. You're in my soul. You're in my heart, you're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old. You are my lover, you're my best friend. You're in my soul. You're in my heart, you're in my soul. You'll be my breath should I grow old.

[Unverified]In a bar in Toledo across from the depot. On a barstool she took off her ring. I thought I'd get closer. So I walked on over. I sat down and asked her name. When the drink finally hit her. She said I'm no quitter. But I finally quit living on dreams. I'm hungry for laughter. And here ever after. I'm after whatever. The other life brings. In the mirror I saw him. And I closely watch him. I thought how he looked out of place. He came to the woman. Who sat their beside me. He had a strange look on his face. The big hands were calloused. He looked like a mountain. For a minute I thought I was dead. But he started shakin'. His big heart was breakin'. He turned to the woman and said. "You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille. Four hungry children and a crop in the field. I've had some bad times. Lived thru' some sad times. But this time your hurtin' won't heal. You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille". After he left us, I ordered more whiskey. I thought how she made him look small. From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room. We walked without talking at all. She was a beauty, but when she came to me. She must have thought I lost my mind. I couldn't hold her, 'coz the words that he told her. Kept coming back time after time. You picked the fine time to leave me Lucille. Four hungry children and a crop in the field. I've had some bad times. Lived thru' some sad times. But this time your hurtin' won't heal.

You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre. Contemplating a crime. She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running. Like a watercolor in the rain. Don't bother asking for explanations. She'll just tell you that she came. In the year of the cat. She doesn't give you time for questions. As she locks up your arm in hers. And you follow till your sense of which direction. Completely disappears. By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls. There's a hidden door she leads you to. These days, she says, "I feel my life. Just like a river running through". The year of the cat. Why she looks at you so coolly?. And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea. She comes in incense and patchouli. So you take her, to find what's waiting inside. The year of the cat. Well morning comes and you're still with her. And the bus and the tourists are gone. And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket. So you have to stay on. But the drumbeat strains of the night remain. In the rhythm of the new-born day. You know sometime you're bound to leave her. But for now you're going to stay. In the year of the cat.

When I'm withThe city streets are empty now. (The lights don't shine no more). And so the songs are way down low. (Turning, turning, turning). A sound that flows into my mind. (The echoes of the daylight). Of everything that is alive. (In my blue world). I turn to stone. When you are gone. I turn to stone. Turn to stone. When you comin' home. I can't go on. The dying embers of the night. (A fire that slowly fades till dawn). Still glow upon the wall so bright. (Turning, turning, turning). The tired streets that hide away. (From here to everywhere they go). Roll past my door into the day. (In my blue world). I turn to stone. When you are gone. I turn to stone. Turn to stone. When you comin' home. I can't go on. Turn to stone. When you are gone. I turn to stone. Yes, I'm turnin' to stone. 'Cause you ain't comin' home. Why you ain't comin' home. If I'm turnin' to stone?. You've been gone for so long. And I can't carry on. Yes, I'm turnin', I'm turnin'. I'm turnin' to stone. The dancing shadows on the wall. (The two step in the hall). Are all I see since you've been gone. (Turning, turning, turning). Through all I sit here and I wait. (I turn to stone, I turn to stone). You will return again someday. (To my blue world). I turn to stone. When you are gone.

When you comin' home. I can't go on. Turn to stone. When you are gone. I turn to stoneOoh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh. Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you. The red magic satin playing near, too. All through the morning rain, I gaze the sun doesn't shine. The rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind. In the garden, I see the west purple shower, bells and tea. Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green. Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud. Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud. Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue. The playgrounds will laugh. If you try to ask. Oh, is it cool? Is it cool?. If you arrive and don't see me, I'm going to be, be with my baby. I am free, flying in her arms, over the sea. Stained window, yellow candy screen. See speakers of kites, with velvet roses diggin' freedom flight. A present from you, Strawberry letter 22. The music plays, I sit in [Incomprehensible], for you. Ooh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh. Aah aah aah. Aah aah aah. A present from you, Strawberry letter 22. The music plays, I sit in for a few. Ooh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh. ...Number please. Hot line, hot line. Calling on the hot line. For your love, for your love. Hot line, hot line. Calling on the hot line. On the hot line. I'm calling on the hot line for your love. Baby, 'cause I'm burnin' up. Like a house on fire. My desire is climbin' higher, baby. Girl, the way you move your lips. I can tell you got fire in your kiss. The way you flash your eyes. Looks like lightnin' lightin' up the sky. Stop all the calls in the world. Till I catch you, girl. Catch you at home. I asked the C.I.A.. If it was okay to use their private phone. Oh, baby, baby. Hot line, hot line. Calling on the hot line. For your love, for your love. Hot line, hot line. Calling on the hot line. On the hot line. Operator, excuse me please.

Your love makes me want to shout. You're my lover, undercover. You know what I'm talkin' about. Hot line, hot line. Calling on the hot line. For your love, for your loveLost and all alone. I always thought that I could make it on my own. Since you left, I hardly make it through the day. My tears get in the way. And I need you back to stay. I wander through the night. And search the world to find the words to make it right. All I want is just the way it used to be. With you here close to me. I've got to make you see. That I'm lost without your love. Life without you isn't worth the trouble of. And I'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel. A touch without a feel. I can't believe it's real. And someday soon I'll wake. And find my heart won't have to break. Yes I'm lost without your love. Life without you isn't worth the trouble of. All I want is just the way it used to be. I need you here with me. Oh darlin' can't you see?. If we had love before. We can have it back once moreHoy en mi ventana brilla el sol. Y el corazon. Se pone triste. Contemplando la ciudad. Porque te vas. Como cada noche desperte. Pensando en ti. Y en mi reloj todas las horas vi pasar. Porque te vas. Todas las promesas de mi amor. Se iran contigo. Me olvidaras me olividaras. Junto a la estacion hoy. Ilorare idual que un nino. Porque te vas. Porque te vas. Porque te vas. Porque te vas. Porque te vas. Bajo la penumbra de un farol. Se dormiran. Todas las cosas. Que quedaron por decir. Se dormiran. Junto a las manillas de un reloj. Esperaran. Todas las horas. Que quedaron por vivir. Esperaran. Todas las promesas de mi amor. Se iran contigoJust to admit one mistake. That can be hard to take. I know we've made them fall. But only fools come back for more. Being the fool I am. I figured in all your plans, darling. Your perfumed letters didn't say. That you'd be leaving any day. So you win again, you win again. Here I stand again, the loser. And just for fun you took my love and run. But love had just begun. I can't refuse her. But now I know that I'm the fool. Who won your love to lose it all. When you come back, you win again. And I'm not proud to say. I let love slip away. Now I'm the one who's crying. I'm a fool there's no denying. When will my heartache end?. Will my whole life depend. On fading memories. You took the game this time with ease. So you win again, you win again. Here I stand again, the loser. And just for fun you took my love and run. But love had just begun. I can't refuse her. But now I know that I'm the fool. Who won your love to lose it all. When you come back, you win again. When will my heartache end?. Will my whole life depend. On fading memories. You took the game this time with ease. So you win again, you win again. Here I stand again, the loser. And just for fun you took my love and run. But love had just begun. I can't refuse her. But now I know that I'm the fool. Who won your love to lose it all. When you come back, you win againBackstroke lover always hidin' 'neath the covers. 'Til I talked to your daddy he say. He said you ain't seen nothin' 'til you're down on a MUFF AND.

Grand Prix Eurovision 1977 (c) 1976 by Éditions Do-Si-La Music. . 1 Comme un enfant aux yeux de lumière qui voit passer au loin les oiseaux.   Comme l'oiseau bleu survolant la terre, vois comme le monde, le monde est beau. . 2 Beau ce bateau dansant sur les vagues ivre de vie d'amour et de vent.   Belle la chanson naissante des vagues abandonnée au sable blanc. . 3 Blanc l'innocent le sang du poète qui en chantant invente l'amour.   Pour que la vie s'habille de fête et que la nuit se change en jour. . 4 Jour d'une vie où l'aube se lève pour réveiller la ville aux yeux lourds.   Où les matins effeuillent les rêves pour nous donner un mond' d'amour. . R	L'amour c'est toi, l'amour c'est moi. 	L'oiseau c'est toi, l'enfant c'est moi. . 5 Moi je ne suis qu'une fille de l'ombre qui voit briller l'étoile du soir.   Toi mon étoile qui tisse ma ronde viens allumer mon soleil noir. . 6 Noire la misère, les hommes et la guerre qui croient tenir les rênes du temps.   Pays d'amour n'a pas de frontière pour ceux qui ont un coeur d'enfant. . 7 Comme un enfant aux yeux de lumière qui voit passer au loin les oiseaux.   Comme l'oiseau bleu survolant la terre, nous trouverons ce monde amour. . RSo I sing you to sleep, after the loving,. with a song I just wrote yesterday.

Needles and pins. ...(Mmm mmm, mmm mmm). Slip sliding away. Slip slidin' away. You know the nearer your destination. The more you're slip slidin' away. I know a man. He came from my home town. He wore his passion for his woman. Like a thorny crown. He said, "Dolores, I live in fear". My love for you is so overpowering. I'm afraid that I will disappear. Slip sliding away. Slip slidin' away. You know the nearer your destination. The more you're slip sliding away. And I know a woman. Became a wife. These are the very words she uses. To describe her life. She said "A good day, ain't got no rain". She said "A bad day's when I lie in bed. And think of things that might have been". Slip sliding away. Slip slidin' away. (Ooh ooh). You know the nearer your destination. The more you're slip sliding away. And I know a father. Who had a son. He longed to tell him all the reasons. For the things he'd done. He came a long way, just to explain. He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping. Then he turned around and headed home again. He's slip slidin'. Slip sliding away. (Ooh ooh). You know the nearer your destination.   (Ooh ooh ooh). The more you're slip slidin' away. And God only knows. God makes his plan. The information's unavailable. To the mortal man.

Eagle flew out of the night. He was something to observe. Came in close, I heard a voice. Standing stretching every nerve. Had to listen had no choice. I did not believe the information. (I) just had to trust imagination. My heart going boom boom boom. "Son," he said "Grab your things,. I've come to take you home.". . To keep in silence I resigned. My friends would think I was a nut. Turning water into wine. Open doors would soon be shut. So I went from day to day. Tho' my life was in a rut. "Till I thought of what I'd say. Which connection I should cut. I was feeling part of the scenery. I walked right out of the machinery. My heart going boom boom boom. "Hey" he said "Grab your things. I've come to take you home.". (Back home.). . When illusion spin her net. I'm never where I want to be. And liberty she pirouette. When I think that I am free. Watched by empty silhouettes. Who close their eyes but still can see. No one taught them etiquette. I will show another me. Today I don't need a replacement. I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant.

But that was all he missed and he ain't comin' back. At a tombstone bar in a jukejoint car he made a stop. Just long enough to grab a handle off the top. Next stop, Chi-town, Lido put the money down, let it roll. He said, "One more job oughta get it. One last shot 'fore we quit it, one for the road". Lido, oh, oh, oh. He's for the money, he's for the show. Lido's a waitin' for the go. Lido, oh, oh, oh. He said, "One more job oughta get it. One last shot 'fore we quit it, one more for the road". Lido be runnin' havin' great big fun. Until he got the note. Sayin', "Tow the line or blow it". And that was all she wrote. He be makin' like a beeline headin' for the borderline, goin' for broke. Sayin', "One more hit oughta do it. This joint ain't nothin' to it, one more for the road". Lido, oh, oh, oh. He's for the money, he's for the show. Lido's a waitin' for the go. Lido, oh, oh, oh.

Angelo knew it could never be,. They ran away to their destiny. Running away together. Running away forever. Angelo. Running away from danger. Hiding from every stranger. Angelo. They knew it wasn't wrong. They found a love so strong. They took their lives at night. And in the morning light. They found them on the sand. They saw them lying there, hand-in-hand. Long ago,.

Hold me and tell me that the words you say are true. Answer the question I must ask of you. Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?. I guarantee it will bring you down, if you try and fool yourself. Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?. You can take it seriously or take it somewhere else. Take all the freedom that a lover will allow. If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now. Where love goes, a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep. Don't make a promise that you cannot keep. Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?. I guarantee it will bring you down, if you try and fool yourself. Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?. You can take it seriously or take it somewhere else. If you wanna get close to me. You could do it so easily. Is it love that I see when I look in your eyes. Or just another empty lie?. Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?. I guarantee it will bring you down, if you try and fool yourself. Well, do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?. You can take it seriously or take it somewhere elseThere you are. Looking just the same as you did last time I touched you. And here I am. Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you. Do you love him?. As much as I love her. Will that love be strong?. When old feelings start to stir. Looks like we made it. Left each other on the way. To another love. Looks like we made it. Or I thought so 'til today. Until you were there everywhere. And all I could taste was love the way we made it. Love's so strange. Playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting. And we're the fools. Standing close enough to touch those burning memories. And if I hold you for the sake of all those times. Love made us lose our minds. Could I ever let you go.... Oh, no we made it. Left each other on the way to another love.... Looks like we made it. Or I thought so 'til today. Until you were there everywhere. And all I could taste was love the way we made it. Ohhhhhh, we made it. Looks like we made it. Left each other on the way to another love. Looks like we made it. Or I thought so 'til today. Until you were there everywhere. And all I could taste was love the way we made it.... Looks like we made it.... Oh, babe we made it...Jimmy Buffett. Miscellaneous. Margaritaville. . By: Jimmy Buffett . 1977 . Nibblin' on sponge cake . Watchin' the sun bake . All of those tourists covered with oil . Strummin' my six-string . On my front porch swing . Smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to boil . Chorus: . Wastin' away again in Margaritaville . Searching for my lost shaker of salt . Some people claim that there's a woman to blame . But I know it's nobody's fault . I don't know the reason . I stayed here all season . Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo . But it's a real beauty . A Mexican cutie . How it got here I haven't a clue . Chorus: . Wastin' away again in Margaritaville . Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt . Some people claim that there's a woman to blame . Now I think . Hell, it could be my fault . I blew out my flip-flop . Stepped on a pop-top . Cut my heel had to cruise on back home . But there's booze in the blender . And soon it will render . That frozen concoction that helps me hang on . Wastin' away again in Margaritaville . Searching for my lost shaker of salt . Some people claim that there's a woman to blame . But I know it's my own damn fault . Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame . And I know it's my own damn faultI was a little too tall could've used a few pounds. Tight pants points hardly renowned. She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes. And points all her own sitting way up high. Way up firm and high. Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy. Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy. Workin' on mysteries without any clues. Workin' on our night moves. Tryin' to make some front page drive in news. Workin' on our night moves. In the summertime. M-m-m-m.... In the sweet summertime. (ooh...) We weren't in love oh no far from it. (ooh-ooh-ooh) We weren't searchin' for some pie in the sky summit. (ooh...) We were just young and restless and bored. (ooh-ooh-ooh) Livin' by the sword. (ooh...) And we'd steal away every chance we could. (ooh-ooh-ooh) Backroom to the alley or the trusty woods. (ooh...) I used her she used me but neither one cared. (ooh-ooh-ooh) We were gettin' our share. Workin' on our night moves. Tryin' to lose the (ooh... ooh-ooh) awkward teenage blues. Workin' on our night moves. M-m-m-m.... And it was summertime. M-m-m-m.... Sweet summertime summertime. Oh... wonder. Felt the lightning yeah. Waited on the thunder. Waited on the thunder. I woke last night to the sound of thunder. How far off I sat and wondered. Started hummin' a song from 1962. Ain't it funny how the night moves. When you just don't seem to have as much to lose. Strange how the night moves. With autumn closin' in. M-m-m-m.... Night moves. M-m-m-m ....

I remember I rememberOnce I rose above the noise and confusion. Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion. I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high. Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man. Though my mind could think I still was a mad man. I hear the voices when I'm dreamin', I can hear them say. Carry on, my wayward son. For there'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no more. Masquerading as a man with a reason. My charade is the event of the season. And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know. On a stormy sea of moving emotion. Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean. I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say. Carry on, my wayward son. For there'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no more. Carry on, you will always remember. Carry on, nothing equals the splendor. Now your life's no longer empty. Surely heaven waits for you. Carry on, my wayward son. For there'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no moreDon't you wonder sometimes. 'Bout sound and vision. Blue, blue, electric blue. That's the color of my room. Where I will live. Blue, blue. Pale blinds drawn all day. Nothing to do, nothing to say. Blue, blue. I will sit right down. Waiting for the gift of sound and vision. And I will save you. Waiting for the gift of sound and vision. Drifting into my solitary, over my head. Don't you wonder sometimes. 'Bout sound and visionEnjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself with me. Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself with me. You better enjoy yourself. You better enjoy yourself. You sittin' over there. Starin' into his face. While people are dancin'.

You had a temper like my jealousy. Too hot, too greedy. How could you leave me. When I needed to possess you?. I hated you, I loved you too. Bad dreams in the night.

Hey hey hey. There lived a certain man in Russia long ago. He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow. Most people looked at him with terror and with fear. But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear. He could preach the Bible like a preacher. Full of ecstacy and fire. But he also was the kind of teacher. Women would desire. Ra ra Rasputin. Lover of the Russian Queen. There was a cat that really was gone. Ra ra Rasputin. Russia's greatest love machine. It was a shame how he carried on. He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar. But the Kasachok he danced really wunderbar. In all affairs of state he was the man to please. But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze. For the Queen he was no wheeler dealer. Though she'd heard the things he'd done. She believed he was a holy healer. Who would heal her son. Ra ra Rasputin. Lover of the Russian Queen. There was a cat that really was gone. Ra ra Rasputin. Russia's greatest love machine. It was a shame how he carried on. (But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger. For power became known to more and more people. The demands to do something about this outrageous. Man became louder and louder). Hey hey hey. Hey hey hey. Hey hey hey. "This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies. But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please". No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms. Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms. Then one night some men of higher standing. Set a trap, they're not to blame. "Come to visit us" they kept demanding. And he really came. Ra ra Rasputin. Lover of the Russian queen. They put some poison into his wine. Ra ra Rasputin. Russia's greatest love machine. He drank it all and said "I feel fine". Ra ra Rasputin. Lover of the Russian Queen. They didn't quit, they wanted his head. Ra ra Rasputin. Russia's greatest love machine. And so they shot him till he was dead. (Oh, those Russians)I can't stand the rain against my window Bringing back sweet memories. I can't stand the rain 'gainst my window. 'Cause he's not here with me. Hey window pane, do you remember. How sweet it used to be when we were together?. Everything was so grand, yes it was. Now that we've parted. And there's one sound that I just can't stand. I can't stand the rain against my window. Bringing back sweet memories. I can't stand the rain alone with the pillow. Where his head used to lay, yeah. I know you've got some sweet memories. But like a window, you ain't got nothin' to say. I can't stand the rain against my window. Bringing back sweet memories, hey. I can't stand the rain, ooh. Against my window, oh no no. 'Cause he's not here with me, uh. Alone with the pillow, uh, uh. Where his head used to lay, yeah. I know you've got some sweet memories. But like a window, you ain't got nothin' to say. Hey, hey, uh, uh. I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain. I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain. I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain. I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain. I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain. Get off my window now, get off my window. Get off my window, nah, I can't stand the rain. I can't stand the rain, ooh, can't stand the rain, ohSpending all my nights, all my money going out on the town. Doing anything just to get you off of my mind. But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again. Trying to forget you is just a waste of time. . Baby come back, any kind of fool could see. There was something in everything about you. Baby come back, you can blame it all on me. I was wrong, and I just can't live without you. . All day long, wearing a mask of false bravado. Trying to keep up the smile that hides a tear. But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again. How I wish to God that you were here. . Baby come back, any kind of fool could see. There was something in everything about you. Baby come back, you can blame it all on me. I was wrong, and I just can't live without you. . Now that I put it all together. Give me the chance to make you see. Have you used up all the love in your heart. Nothing left for me, ain't there nothing left for me. . Baby come back, any kind of fool could see. There was something in everything about you. Baby come back, you can blame it all on me. I was wrong and I just can't live without you. I was wrong and I just can't liveYou don't bring me flowers. You don't sing me love songs. You hardly talk to me anymore. When you come through that door at the end of the day. I remember when you couldn't wait to love me. Used to hate to leave me. Now after loving me late at night. When it's good for you, babe. And you're feeling all right. When you just roll over and turn out the light. And you don't bring me flowers anymore. It used to be so natural. It used to be. To talk about forever. Mmm. But used-to-bes don't count anymore. They just lay on the floor. Till we sweep them away. And baby I remember all the things you taught me. I learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry. Well, I learned how to love and I learned how to lie. So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye. So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye. You don't bring me flowers any more. Well, you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye. Because you don't say you need me. You don't sing me love songs. You don't bring me flowers anymoreI cried a tear. You wiped it dry. I was confused. You cleared my mind. . I sold my soul. You bought it back for me. And held me up. And gave me dignity. Somehow you needed me. . You gave me strength. To stand alone again. To face the world. Out on my own again. . You put me high. Upon a pedestal. So high that I could. Almost see eternity. You needed me, you needed me. . And I can't believe it's you. I can't believe it's true. I needed you. And you were there. . And I'll never leave. Why should I leave, I'd be a fool. 'Cause I've finally found. Someone who really cares. . You held my hand. When it was cold. When I was lost. You took me home. . You gave me hope. When I was at the end. And turned my lies. Back into truth again. You even called me friend. . You gave me strength. To stand alone again. To face the world. Out on my own again. . You put me high. Upon a pedestal. So high that I could. Almost see eternity. You needed me, you needed me. You needed me, you needed meI was walkin' down the street. Concentratin' on truckin' right. I heard a dark voice beside of me. And I looked round in a state of fright. I saw four faces one mad. A brother from the gutter. They looked me up and down a bit. And turned to each other. I say I don't like cricket, oh no. I love it. I don't like cricket, no, no. I love it. Don't you walk through my words. You got to show some respect. Don't you walk through my words. 'Cause you ain't heard me out yet. Well he looked down at my silver chain. He said, "I'll give you one dollar". I said, "You've got to be jokin' man". It was a present from me mother. He said "I like it I want it. I'll take it off your hands. And you'll be sorry you crossed me. You'd better understand that you're alone. A long way from home". And I say I don't like reggae, no, no. I love it. I don't like reggae, oh. I love it.

I heard a dark voice beside me say. "Would you like something harder?". She said, "I've got it you want it. My harvest is the best. And if you try it you'll like it. And wallow in a dreadlock holiday". And I say don't like Jamaica oh no. I love her. Don't like Jamaica, oh no. I love her oh yea. Don't you walk through her words. You got to show some respect.

If I turn away. Am I strong enough to see it through?. Go crazy is what I will do. If I can't have you. I don't want nobody, baby. If I can't have you, uh-huh-huh, oh. If I can't have you.

PAUL MCCARTNEY & WINGSIt's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear. She puts on her make up and brushes her long blonde hair. And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?". And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight". We go to a party and everyone turns to see. This beautiful lady, that's walking around with me. And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?". And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight". And I feel wonderful. Because I see the love light in your eyes. And the wonder of it all. Is that you just don't realize how much I love you. It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head. So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed. And then I tell her, as I turn out the light. I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight.

Action, I got so much to give. I want to give it, I want to get some too. Oh I, I love the nightlife. I got to boogie, on the disco 'round, oh yeah. Oh, I love the night life.

Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park. Summer night city. In the sun I feel like sleeping, I can't take it for too long. My impatience slowly creeping up my spine and growing strong. I know what's waiting there for me, tonight I'm loose and fancy-free. When the night comes with the action I just know it's time to go. Can't resist the strange attraction from that giant dynamo. Lots to take and lots to give, time to breathe and time to live. Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark. Summer night city. Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park. Summer night city. It's elusive call it glitter somehow something turns me on. Some folks only see the litter, we don't miss them when they're gone. I love the feeling in the air, my kind of people everywhere. When the night comes with the action I just know it's time to go. Can't resist the strange attraction from that giant dynamo. And tomorrow, when the dawning and the first birds start to sing. In the pale light of the morning nothings worth remembering. It's a dream, it's out of reach scattered driftwood on the beach. Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark. Summer night city. Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park. Summer night city. Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark. Summer night city. Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park. Summer night city. Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark. Summer night city.

'Cause baby, I believe that you're a star. Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth (yes, the truth). Making love to you is such a thrill. Everyone's a winner, baby, that's no lie (yes, no lie). You never fail to satisfy (satisfy). Let's do it again. Never could explain just what was happening to me. Just one touch of you and I'm a flame. Baby, it's amazing just how wonderful it is. That the things we like to do are just the same. Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth (yes, the truth). Making love to you is such a thrill. Everyone's a winner, baby, that's no lie (yes, no lie). You never fail to satisfy (satisfy). Let's do it again. Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth (yes, the truth). Making love to you is such a thrill. Everyone's a winner, baby, that's no lie (yes, no lie). You never fail to satisfy (satisfy). Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Oh, baby...You asked me if I love you, and I choke on my reply.. I'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie.. And who am I to judge you on what you say or do. I'm only just beginning to see the real you.. And sometimes when we touch. The honesty's too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide.. I wanna hold you till I die. Till we both break down and cry. I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.. Romance and all its strategy leaves me battling with my pride.. But through the insecurity some tenderness survives.. I'm just another writer, still trapped within my truths.. A hesitant prize fighter, still trapped within my youth.. And sometimes when we touch. The honesty's too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide.. I wanna hold you till I die. Till we both break down and cry. I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.. At times I'd like to break you and drag you to your knees.. At times I'd like to break through and hold you endlessly.. At times I understand you, and I know how hard you've tried.. I've watched while love commands you. And I've watched love pass you by.. At times I think we're drifters, still searching for a friend.. A brother or a sister, but then the passion flares again.. And sometimes when we touch. The honesty's too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide.. I wanna hold you till I die. Till we both break down and cry. I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.Burn baby burn. Burn baby burn. Burn baby burn. Burn baby burn. Burnin'. To my surprise, yes. One hundred stories high. People gettin' loose y'all.

How to tell you girl.... I wanna build my world around you.... Tell you that it's true. I wanna make you understand I'm talking about a lifetime plan.... That's the way it began we were hand in hand. Glenn Miller's band was better than before. We yelled and screamed for more. And the Porter tune. (Night and Day). Made us dance across the room. It ended all too soon. On the way back home I promised you'd never be alone.... Hurry don't be late. I can hardly wait I said to myself when we're old. We'll go dancing in the dark. Walking through the park and reminiscing. Friday night it was late I was walking you home we got down to the gate. And I was dreaming of the night. Would it turn out right?. Now as the years roll on.... Each time we hear our favorite song. The memories come along. Older times we're missing spending the hours reminiscing.... Hurry don't be late. I can hardly wait I said to myself when we're old. We'll go dancing in the dark. (woo ooh-ooh). Walking through the park and reminiscingYou always won every time you placed a bet. You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet. Every time they were sure they had you caught. You were quicker than they thought. You'd just turn your back and walk. You always said the cards would never do you wrong. The trick, you said, was never play the game too long. A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take. The only loss you could forsake. The only bluff you couldn't fake. And you're still the same. I caught up with you yesterday. Moving game to game. No one standing in your way. Turning on the charm. Long enough to get you by. You're still the same. You still aim high. There you stood, everybody watched you play. I just turned and walked away. I had nothing left to say. 'Cause you're still the same. You're still the same. Moving game to game. Some things never change. You're still the same8Don't look back, a new day is breakin. It's been too long since I felt this way. I don't mind where I get taken. The road is callin, today is the day. I can see, it took so long just to realize. I'm much too strong not to compromise. Now I see what I am is holding me down. I'll turn it around. I finally see the dawn arrivin. I see beyond the road I'm drivin. It's a bright horizon and I'm awaken. I see myself in a brand new way. The sun is shinin, the clouds are breakin. Cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play. I can tell there's no more time left to criticize. I've seen what I could not recognize. Everything in my life was leading me on. But I can be strong yes I could. I finally see the dawn arrivin. I see beyond the road I'm drivin. Don't look back, a new day is breakin. It's been so long since I felt this way. I don't mind where I get taken. The road is callin, today is the day. I can see, it took so long just to realize. I'm much too strong not to compromise. Now I see what I am is holding me down.

I took the tube back out of town. Back to the Rollin' Pin. I felt a little like a dying clown. With a streak of Rin Tin Tin. I stretched back and I hiccuped. And looked back on my busy day. Eleven hours in the Tin Pan. God, there's got to be another way. Well, who are you?.   (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?). Ohh, who are you?.   (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?).

Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields. In sixty-five I was seventeen and running up one-on-one. I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on. Running on-running on empty. Running on-running blind. Running on-running into the sun. But I'm running behind. Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive. Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive. In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own. I don't know when that road turned into the road I'm on. Running on-running on empty. Running on-running blind. Running on-running into the sun. But I'm running behind. Everyone I know, everywhere I go. People need some reason to believe. I don't know about anyone but me. If it takes all night, that'll be all right. If I can get you to smile before I leave. Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels. I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels. I look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through. Looking into their eyes I see them running too. Running on-running on empty. Running on-running blind. Running on-running into the sun. But I'm running behind. Honey you really tempt me. You know the way you look so kind. I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind. You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find. Running into the sun but I'm running behindWhen I wake up in the morning, love. And the sunlight hurts my eyes. And something without warning, love. Bears heavy on my mind. Then I look at you. And the world's alright with me. Just one look at you. And I know it's gonna be a lovely day. Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day. Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day. Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day. Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day. When the day that lies ahead of me. Seems impossible to face. When someone else instead of me. Always seems to know the way. Then I look at you.

Kept thinking, I could never live without you by my side. But then I spent so many nights thinking, how you did me wrong. And I grew strong and I learned how to get along. And so you're back from outer space. I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face. I should have changed that stupid lock. I should have made you leave your key. If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me. Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now. 'Cause you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?. Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?. Oh, no, not I, I will survive. Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give. And I'll survive, I will survive, hey, hey. It took all the strength I had not to fall apart. Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart. And I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself. I used to cry but now I hold my head up high. And you see me, somebody new. I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you. And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free. But now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me. Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now. 'Cause you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one, who tried to break me with goodbye. Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?. Oh, no, not I, I will survive. Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give. And I'll survive, I will survive, oh. Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now. 'Cause you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one, who tried to break me with goodbye. Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?. Oh, no, not I, I will survive. Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give. And I'll survive, I will survive, I will surviveHere I lie in a lost and lonely part of town. Held in time in a world of tears I slowly drown. Goin' home I just can't make it all alone.

If you really need me, just reach out and touch me. Come on, honey, tell me so, tell me so, baby. He's acting shy, looking for an answer. Come on honey, let's spend the night together.

Me minus you is such a lonely ride. The breakup we had has made me lonesome and sad. I realize I love you. 'Cause I want you bad, hey, hey. I spent the evening with the radio. Regret the moment that I let you go. Our quarrel was such a way of learning so much. I know now that I love you. 'Cause I need your touch, hey, hey. Reunited and it feels so good. Reunited 'cause we understood. There's one perfect fit. And, sugar, this one is it. We both are so excited. 'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey. I sat here staring at the same old wall. Came back to life just when I got your call. I wished I could climb right through the telephone line. And give you what you want. So you will still be mine, hey, hey. I can't go cheating, honey, I can't play. I found it very hard to stay away. As we reminisce on precious moments like this. I'm glad we're back together. 'Cause I missed your kiss, hey, hey. Reunited and it feels so good. Reunited 'cause we understood. There's one perfect fit. And, sugar, this one is it. We both are so excited. 'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ba-a-a-byYou get a shiver in the dark. It's raining in the park but meantime. South of the river you stop and you hold everything. A band is blowing Dixie double four time. You feel alright when you hear that music ring. Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces. Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down. Competition in other places. Ah but the horns, they blowing that sound. Way on down south, way on down south, London town. You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords. Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing. Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford. When he gets up under the lights to play his thing. And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene. He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright. He can play the honky tonk like anything. Saving it up for Friday night. With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing. And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner. Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles. They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band. It ain't what they call rock and roll. Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole. Creole. And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone. And says at last, just as the time bell rings. "Goodnight, now it's time to go home". Then he makes it fast with one more thing. "We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing"Ah ah ah. When I was young it seemed that life was so wonderful. A miracle oh it was beautiful magical. And all the birds in the trees well they'd be singing so happily. Oh joyfully oh playfully watching me. But then they send me away teach me how to be sensible. Logical oh responsible practical. And then they showed me a world where I could be so dependable. Clinical oh intellectual cynical. There are times... when all the world's asleep. The questions run too deep for such a simple man.... Won't you please... please tell me what we've learned?. I know it sounds absurd but please tell me who I am.... I say now watch what you say they'll be calling you a radical liberal oh fanatical criminal. Won't you sign up your name. We'd like to feel you're acceptable respectable oh presentable a vegetable. Oh, ch-ch-check it out yeah. At night when all the world's asleep. The questions run so deep for such a simple man.... Won't you please oh won't you tell me please tell me what we've learned?.

We played the games that people play. We made mistakes along the way. Somehow I know deep in my heart. You needed me. Remembering the pain if I must say. It's deep in my mind and locked away. But then most of all. I do love you still. Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget. Those feelings we can't put aside. For what we had, sometimes I tried to understand. But it's so heavy on the mind. So many dreams that flew away. So many words we didn't say. Two people lost in a storm. Where did we go?. Where'd we go?. We lost what we both had found. You know we let each other down. But then most of all. I do love you still. We played the games that people play. We made our mistakes along the way. Somehow I know deep in my heart. You needed me. 'Cause I needed you so desperately. We were too blind to see. But then most of all. I do love you. StillWe move for all mankind. A million miles from everything we've ever known. We're on their hearts and minds. A million heads are bowed to bring us safely home. Hemmed in by emptiness. A million ways that everything could be undone. This hollow in my chest is filled with reasons. Not to sing but I found one, I know. We are not alone, we feel an unseen love. We are sons and heirs of grace, we are children of. A light that never dims, a love that never dies. Keep your chin up child and wipe the tears from your eyes. In sleep we saw ourselves. A million years we had been waiting there it seems. While someone weaves a spell. A million stars look on in witness to our dreams, I know. We are not alone, we feel an unseen love. We are sons and heirs of grace, we are children of. A light that never dims, a love that never dies. Keep your chin up child and wipe the tears from your eyes. We feel an unseen love. We are children of light. We are not alone, we feel an unseen love. We are sons and heirs of grace, we are children of. A light that never dims, a love that never dies. Keep your chin up child and wipe the tears from your eyes. I stand ready and tall, reflect the lightYou packed in the morning, I stared out the window. And I struggled for something to say. You left in the rain without closing the door. I didn't stand in your way.. Now I miss you more than I, missed you before. And now where I'll find comfort, God knows. 'Cause you left me just when I needed you most. (just when I needed you most). Now most every morning, I stare out the window. And I think about where you might be. I've written you letters that I'd like to send. If you would just send one to me.. 'Cause I need you more than I needed before. And now where I'll find comfort, God knows. 'Cause you left me just when I needed you most. (yoou left me just when I needed you most.). You packed in the morning, I stared out the window. And I struggled for something to say. You left in the rain without closing the door. I didn't stand in your way.. Now I love you more than I loved you before. And now where I'll find comfort, God knows. 'Cause you left me just when I needed you most. Oh yeah, you left me just when I needed you most. You left me just when I needed you most.Baby, I can't figure it out. Your kisses taste like honey. Sweet lies don't gimme no rise. Oh, oh, what you're trying to do?. Livin' on your cheatin' and the pain grows inside me. It's enough to leave me crying in the rain. Love you forever but you're driving me insane. And I'm hanging on. Oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in. Our love has got the power. Too many lovers in one lifetime. Ain't good for you. You treat me like a vision in the night. Someone there to stand behind you. When your world ain't working right. I ain't no vision, I am the man. Who loves you inside out. Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out. I love no other way. What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?. Wrap myself up and take me home again. Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me. I figure it's the love that keeps you warm. Let this moment be forever. We won't ever feel the storm. I ain't no vision, I am the man. Who loves you inside out. Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out. I love no other way. What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?. Don't try to tell me it's all over. I can't hear a word I can't hear a line. No man could love you more and that's what I'm cryin' for. You can't change the way I feel inside. You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow. Blow out the candle, I will burn again tomorrow. No man on earth can stand between my love and I. And no matter how you hurt me I will love you till I die. I ain't no vision, I am the man. Who loves you inside and out. Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out. I love no other way. What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?. Loves you inside and out. Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out. I love no other way. What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?. Loves you inside and out. Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out. I love no other way. What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. Do you feel like you ever want. To try my love and see how well it fits?. Baby, can't you see when you look at me. I can't kick this feelin' when it hits. All alone in my bed at night. I grab my pillow and squezze it tight. I think of you and I dream of you all of the time. What am I gonna do?. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. Sometime, ddon't you feel like you. Never really had a love that's real?. Well, here I am and who's to say. A better love you won't find today. Just one chance and I will show you love. like no other, two steps above. On your ladder I'll be a peg. I want your lovin', please don't make me beg. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I need your love. I'll share my dreams and make you see. I'm really there, your love I need. I want your love. I need your love. Just like the birds need sky above. I'll share my dreams and make you see. I'm really there, your love I need. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your loveAlthough the things you've done I wouldn't criticize. I guess you had your way. You see I've gotta make you understand. I know it sounds a foolish thing to say. But it don't matter baby, 'cause today's another day. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life and let me see. Remember, tonight we're gonna run till dawn. Remember, tonight we're gonna say. We'll never stop, we got a good thing goin' on. I know you've heard it all before. But I really need you darlin', every day I need you more. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life and let me see. Can you understand?. (Yes I understand). Can you feel it's right?. (I know it is). Will you be the same?. (I'll do it all again). It's been a year now and it's getting so much better. You came home without a word. Though everybody said you'll soon forget her. They couldn't see and they just didn't understand. And lookin' in the mirror there were fools at either hand. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life and let me see. Can you understand?. (Yes I understand). Can you feel it's right?. (I know it is). Will you be the same?. (I'll do it all again). How many days had I been waiting there to tell you?. I really can't believe. We're walkin' out into the world tonight. We'll do it all again until the break of light. And the feelin' in your heart will soon be shinin' in your eyes. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life.

He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal. When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot.. And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said "Boy, let me tell you what.". "I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too.. And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you.. Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due.. I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.". The boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin,. But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.". Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard.. 'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards.. And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold,. But if you lose the devil gets your soul.. The Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show.". And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow.. And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss.. And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this.. When the Devil finished, Johnny said, "Well, you're pretty good ol' son,. But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.". "Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run!. The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;. Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough.. Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no.. The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.. And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet.. Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again,. 'Cause I've told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.". And he played:. "Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run!. The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;.

A man who was born to be hunted like a wild animal. Because he was poor. But he refused to accept his fate. And today his honor has been restored. He was only nineteen and he was sentenced to die. For something that somebody else did and blamed on El Lute. Then they changed it to life and so he could escape. From then on they chased him and searched for him day and night. All over Spain but the search was in vain for El Lute. He had only seen the dark side of life the man they called El Lute. And he wanted a home just like you and like me. In a country where all would be free. So he taught himself to read and to write it didn't help El Lute. He was one who had dared to escape overnight they had to find El Lute. No one gave you a chance in the Spain of those days. On the walls every place they had put up the face of El Lute. And he robbed where he could just like once Robin Hood. They finally caught him and that seemed the end. But they caught him in vain 'cause a change came for Spain and El Lute. He had only seen the dark side of life the man they called El Lute. And he wanted a home just like you and like me. In a country where all would be free. And then freedom really came to his land and also to El Lute. Now he walks in the light of a sunny new day the man they called El LuteSail on down the line. Bout a half a mile or so. And don't really wanna know. Where you're going. Maybe once or twice you see.

Ain't it funny how the time can go. Friends say they told me so. But it doesn't matter. It was plain to see that. A small town boy like me. Just wasn't your cup of tea. I was wishful thinking. I gave you my heart and. I tried to make you happy. And you gave me nothing in return. You know, it ain't so hard to say. Would you please just go away. Yeah, yeah. I've thrown away the blues.

Real-real-real-real. (To be real!). Real-real-real-realWhile she lays sleeping. I stay out late at night and play my songs. And sometimes, all the nights can be so long. And it's good when I finally make it home. All alone. While she lays dreaming. I try to get undressed without the light. And quietly she says, "How was your night?". And I come to her and say, "It was all right". And I hold her tight. And she believes in me. I'll never know just what she sees in me. I told her someday, if she was my girl. I could change the world with my little songs. I was wrong. But she has faith in me. And so I go on trying faithfully. And who knows maybe, on some special night. If my song is right, I will find a way. Find a way. While she lays waiting. I stumble to the kitchen for a bite. Then I see my old guitar in the night. Just waiting for me like a secret friend. And there's no end. While she lays crying. I fumble with a melody or two. And I'm torn between the things that I should do. And she says to wake her up when I am through. God, her love is true. And she believes in me. I'll never know just what she sees in me. I told her someday, if she was my girl. I could change the world with my little songs. I was wrong. But she has faith in me. And so I go on trying faithfully. And who knows maybe, on some special night. If my song is right, I will find a way. While she waits, while she waits for meWhen I met you in the restaurant. You could tell I was no debutante. You asked me what's my pleasure, a movie or a measure. I'll have a cup of tea. . And tell you all my dreaming, dreaming is free. Dreaming, dreaming is free. . I don't want to live on charity. Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?. Reel to reel is living rarity, people stop and stare at me. We just walk on by, we just keep on dreaming. . Feet feet, walking a two mile. Meet meet, meet me at the turnstile. I never met him, I'll never forget him. . Dream dream, even for a little while. Dream dream, filling up an idle hour. Fade away, radiate. . I sit by and watch the river flow. I sit by and watch the traffic go. Imagine something of your very own. Something you can have and hold. I'd build a road in gold. . Just to have some dreaming, dreaming is free. Dreaming, dreaming is free. Dreaming, dreaming is free. Dreaming is freeWhen I met you, you were seventeen. Not just another teenage queen.

London calling to the underworld. Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls. London calling now don't look to us. Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust. London calling see we ain't got no swing. 'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing. The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in. Meltdown expected and the wheat is growing thin. Engines stop running but I have no fear.
