Come beating on your door. I know that I'm a prisoner. To all my Father held so dear. I know that I'm a hostage. To all his hopes and fears. I just wish I could have told him in the living years. Crumpled bits of paper. Filled with imperfect thoughts. Stilted conversations. I'm afraid that's all we've got. You say you just don't see it. He says it's perfect sense. You just can't get agreement. In this present tense. We all talk a different language. Talkin' in defense. Say it loud, say it clear. You can listen as well as you hear. It's too late when we die. To admit we don't see eye to eye. So we open up a quarrel. Between the present and the past. We only sacrifice the future. It's the bitterness that lasts. So Don't yield to the fortunes. You sometimes see as fate. It may have a new perspective. On a different date. And if you don't give up, and don't give in. You may just be O.K.. Say it loud, say it clear. You can listen as well as you hear. It's too late when we die. To admit we don't see eye to eye. I wasn't there that morning. When my Father passed away. I didn't get to tell him. All the things I had to say. I think I caught his spirit. Later that same year. I'm sure I heard his echo. In my baby's new born tears. I just wish I could have told him in the living years. Say it loud, say it clear. You can listen as well as you hear. It's too late when we die. To admit we don't see eye to eye. Say it loud, say it clear. Say it loud. Don't give up. Don't give inCome on girls. Do you believe in love?. 'Cause I got something to say about it. And it goes something like this. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test. You know, you know, you've got to. Make him express how he feels. And maybe then you'll know your love is real. You don't need diamond rings. Or eighteen karat gold. Fancy cars that go very fast. You know they never last, no, no. What you need is a big strong hand. To lift you to your higher ground. Make you feel like a queen on a throne. Make him love you till you can't come down. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test. You know, you know, you've got to. Make him express how he feels. And maybe then you'll know your love is real. Long stem roses are the way to your heart. But he needs to start with your head. Satin sheets are very romantic. What happens when you're not in bed. You deserve the best in life. So if the time isn't right then move on. Second best is never enough. You'll do much better baby on your own. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test.

So if you want it right now. Make him show you how. Express what he's got. Oh, baby ready or not. And when you're gone he might regret it. Think about the love he once had. Try to carry on but he just won't get it. He'll be back on his knees. To express himself. You've got to make him. Express himself. Hey, hey. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test. You know, you know, you've got to. Make him express how he feels. And maybe then you'll know your love is real. Express yourself. You've got to make him. Express himself. Hey, hey, hey, hey. So if you want it right now. Make him show you how. Express what he's got. Baby ready or not. Express yourself. Respect yourself. Hey, hey. (So if you want it right now).

Your little piece of heaven, turns too dark. Listen to your heart, when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why. But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah. They're swept away, nothing is what it seems. The feeling of belonging to your dreams.... Listen to your heart, when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why. But listen to your heart, before you tell him goodbye.... And there are voices that want to be heard. So much to mention but you can't find the words. The scent of magic, the beauty that's been (beauty that's been). When love was wilder than the wind. Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why. But listen to your heart, before. Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why. But listen to your heart, before. You tell him goodbye...Shot!....

You were content to let me shine, that's your way. You always walked a step behind. So I was the one with all the glory. While you were the one with all the strength. A beautiful face without a name for so long. A beautiful smile to hide the pain. Did you ever know that you're my hero. And everything I would like to be?. I can fly higher than an eagle. For you are the wind beneath my wings. It might have appeared to go unnoticed. But I've got it all here in my heart. I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it. I would be nothing without you. Did you ever know that you're my hero?. You're everything I wish I could be. I could fly higher than an eagle. For you are the wind beneath my wings. Did I ever tell you you're my hero?. You're everything, everything I wish I could be. Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle. For you are the wind beneath my wings. 'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings. Oh, the wind beneath my wings. You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings. Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high. Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings. Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings. Fly, fly, so high against the sky. So high I almost touch the sky. Thank you, thank you. Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wingsWho's that gigolo on the street. With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet. Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed?.

My back was turned and she was gone. Good thing where have you gone?. My good thing you've been gone too long. People say I should forget. There's plenty more don't get upset. People say she's doin' fine. Mutual friends I see sometime. That's not what I want to hear. I want to hear she wants me near. Good thing where have you gone?. My good thing you've been gone too long?. Then one day she came back. I was so happy that I didn't ask. Morning came into my room. Caught me dreaming like a fool. Good thing, good thing.

But sometimes I just pretend. Wish you were holding me. Wish you were still holding me. I just never thought that I would be replaced so soon. I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you. I know I wanted to be free. Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be. But if you see me walking by. And the tears are in my eyes. Look away, baby, look away. And if we meet on the streets someday.

I said, "Hopefully if things go. Well, I'll be with you tonight". So we journeyed to her house. One thing led to an other. I keyed the door, I cold hit the floor. Looked up and it was her mother. I didn't know what to say. I was hanging by a string. She said, "Hey, you two, I was once like you. And I liked to do the wild thing". Wild thing. She loved to do the wild thing. Wild thing.

Although we both lie close together. We feel miles apart, inside. Was it somethin' I said or something I did. Did my words not come out right??. Tho' I tried not to hurt you. Tho' I tried. But I guess that's why they say. Every rose has its thorn. Just like every night has its dawn. Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song. Every rose has its thorn. Yea it does. I listen to our favorite song playin' on the radio. Hear the dj say love's a game of. Easy come and easy go. But I wonder does he know. Has he ever felt like this. And I know that you'd be here right now. If I could have let you know somehow I guess. Every rose has its thorn. Just like every night has its dawn. Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song. Every rose has its thorn. Though it's been a while now. I can still feel so much pain. Like the knife that cuts you the wound heals. But the scar, that scar remains.. I know I could have saved our love that night. If I'd know what to say. Instead of making love. We both made our separate ways. Now I hear you've found somebody new. And that I never meant that much to you. To hear that tears me up inside. And to see you cuts me like a knife, i guess. Every rose has its thorn. Just like every night has its dawn. Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song. Every rose has its thornSo when you really love me. Darling bring me Edelweiss. So when you really love me. You should bring me Edelweiss. Freibier!

Cold coolin' at a bar, and I'm lookin' for some action. But like Mike Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction. The girls are all around, but none of them wanna get with me. My threads are fresh and I'm lookin' def, yo, what's up with L O C?. The girls is all jockin' at the other end of the bar. Havin' drinks with some no name chump. When they know that I'm the star. So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina. I asked the guy, "Why you so fly?" he said, "Funky Cold Medina". Funky Cold Medina. This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks. Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick. It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac. A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap. So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg. Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me. And did the wild thing on my leg. He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner. But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina. You know what I'm sayin'?. I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin' down my door. I got Spuds McKenzie. Alex from Stroh's. They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal. I went up to this girl, she said, "Hi, my name is Sheena". I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina. She said, "I'd like a drink," I said, "Ehm okay, I'll go get it". Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips. And I knew that she was with it. So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned. But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man. So I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener. You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina. You know, ain't no plans with a man. This is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies. Ya know?. Break it down. Back in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection. I took a shot as a contestant on, The Love Connection. The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner. I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner. She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'. Instead she started talkin' 'bout plans for our weddin'. I said, "Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya". That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina. Ya, know what I'm sayin'. That Medina's a monster, y'all. Funky Cold MedinaI said I would get over you. Now I'm here out on my own. Trying to live my life. And now you wanna come back. But I don't need no brand new lies, listen up.

Workin' for the company. I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin'. I'm gonna have a fantasy. But where am I gonna look?. They tell me that love is blind. I really need a girl like an open book. To read between the lines. Love in an elevator. Livin' it up when I'm goin' down. Love in an elevator. Lovin' it up till I hit the ground. Jacki's in the elevator. Lingerie second floor. She said 'can I see you later. And love you just a little more?'. I kinda hope we get stuck. Nobody gets out alive. She said I'll show ya how to fax in the mail room. Honey and have you home by five.

Love in an elevator. Livin' it up when I'm goin' downRemember when the days were long. And rolled beneath a deep blue sky?. Didn't have a care in the world. With mommy and daddy standing by. When happily ever after fails. And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales. The lawyers dwell on small details. Since daddy had to fly. Aah, but I know a place where we can go. That's still untouched by men. We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by. And the tall grass waves in the wind. And you can lay your head back on the ground. And let your hair fall all around me. Offer up your best defense but this is the end. This is the end of the innocence. Oh, beautiful for spacious skies. But now those skies are threatening. They're beating plowshares into swords. For this tired old man that we elected king. Armchair warriors often fail. And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales. The lawyers clean up all details. Since daddy had to lie. Aah, but I know a place where we can go. And wash away this sin. We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by. And the tall grass waves in the wind. Just lay your head back on the ground. And let your hair spill all around me. Offer up your best defense but this is the end. This is the end of the innocence. Who knows how long this will last. Now we've come so far, so fast. But somewhere back there in the dust. That same small town in each of us. I need to remember this. So baby, give me just one kiss. And let me take a long last look. Before we say goodbye. Just lay your head back on the ground. And let your hair fall all around me. Offer up your best defense, this is the end. This is the end of the innocenceOn candy stripe legs the spider man comes. Softly through the shadow of the evening sun. Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead. Looking for the victim shivering in bed. Searching out fear in the gathering gloom. And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room. And there is nothing I can do, when I realize with fright. That the spider man is having me for dinner tonight. Quietly he laughs and shaking his head. Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed. And softer than shadow and quicker than flies. His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes. "Be still, be calm, be quiet now my precious boy. Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more. For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light. The spider man is having you for dinner tonight". And I feel like I'm being eaten. By a thousand million shivering furry holes. And I know that in the morning. I will wake up in the shivering cold. And the spider man is always hungry. Come into my parlor, said the spider to the fly. I have somethingWhat would I have to do. To get you to notice me too. Do I. Stand in line. One of a million. Admiring eyes. Walk a tightrope way up high. Write your name across the sky. I'm going crazy just to let you know. You'd be amazed how much I love you so baby. When I get my hands on you I won't let go. This time I know it's for real. Should I write or call your home. Shout it out with a megaphone. Radio, TV news. Got to find a way. To get my message to you. To say I love you with a neon sign. Anything to make you mine. I'm going crazy just to let you know. If I wait too long for you I might explode baby.

Your girlfriend is on another date with the hero in your dream. Turn around, ask yourself. So, you think you're gonna win this time Manchild?. Is it the pain of the drinking. Or the Sunday sinking feeling. The car never seems to work. When it's late your girlfriend's on a date. And the hero with her in your dream. In your sleep it seemed to like you. Turn around and ask yourself. Turn around ask yourself. Manchild, will you ever win?. Manchild, look at the state you're in. Could you go undercover. And sell your brand new lover. Could you be someone else for a night?. Maybe someone else will love you. You sell your soul for a tacky song. Like the one you hear on the radio. Turn around ask yourself. Turn around and ask yourself. Manchild, will you ever win. Manchild, look at the state you're in. Manchild, he will make you cry. Manchild, Manchild, Manchild. From Monday down to Friday. You're working on another man's car. Or is it in the factory?. It doesn't matter where you are. Just turn around and ask yourself is this communication. Accentuate the positive and give some illustration. See Manchild, you're no one, you turn the microphone on. Control communication when I'm kickin' it and so on. To the point that I need, the air that I breathe. Into an audience that's waiting and ecstatic to receive. For the meantime another mean rhyme, I keep on sayin' it. I know what the time is the crowd will keep playing it. Through the speaker boxes loud's my diagnosis. 'Cause I believe in miracles and words in heavy doses. Enough R E S P E and C T. Respect yourself express no stress the mike is easy. Just believe that all you need is the air that you breathe. Turn around ask yourself. Manchild, will you ever win?. Manchild, look at the state you're in. Manchild, he will make you cry. Manchild, Manchild, Manchild. He's the apple of your eye. Once bitten twice shy, why don't you bite me again. Just take it in the right and go tell your friend. Are you ready for the words I turn the microphone on. A figure of speech to reach you at the back and so on. The style I'm stimulating dance floors. Raise your body temperature now and. This demands for power in the amp you know lauds my diagnosis. 'Cause I believe in miracles and words in heavy dosesHit it now. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Tell me mirror what is wrong?. Can it be my De La clothes. Or is it just my De La song?. What I do ain't make-believe. People say I sit and try. When it comes to being De La. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. Now you tease my Plug One style. And my Plug One spectacles. You say Plug One and Two are hippies. No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull. Always pushing that we've formed an image. There's no need to lie. When it comes to being Plug One. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. Proud, I'm proud of what I am. Poems I speak are Plug Two type. Please, oh, please let Plug Two be. Himself not what you read or write. Right is wrong when hype is written. On the Soul, De La that is. Style is surely our own thing. Not the false disguise of showbiz. De La Soul is from the soul. And this fact I can't deny. Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie. And from me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. Glory, glory Hallelu. Glory for Plugs One and Two. But that glory's been denied. By kizids and dookie eyes. People think they dis my person. By stating I'm darkly pack. I know this so I point at Q Tip. And he states, "Black is black". Mirror, mirror on the wall. Shovel chestnuts in my path. Please keep on up with the nuts. So I don't get in aftermath. But if I do I'll calmly punch them. In the fourth day of July. 'Cause they tried to mess with. Third degree, that's me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and IYou say you want diamonds on a ring of gold. You say you want your story to remain untold. But all the promises we make from the cradle to the grave. When all I want is you. You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it. Treasure just to look upon it all the riches in the night. You say you'll give me eyes in a moon of blindness. A river in a time of dryness, a harbour in the tempest. But all the promises we make from the cradle to the grave. When all I want is you. You say you want your love to work out right. To last with me through the night. You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold. Your story to remain untold, your love not to grow cold.

I've been livin' in style, unaccustomed as I am to the luxury life. I've been hittin' the town and it didn't hit back. I've been doin' the rounds, unaccustomed as I am to the time on my hands. Now, I don't have to tell anybody when I'm gonna get back. Ever since you went away, I've had this sentimental. Inclination not to change a single thing. As I pull the sheets back on the bed. I want to go bury my head in your pillow. Now that I'm alone again, I can't stop breakin' down again. The simplest things set me off again and take me to that place. Where I can't find my brave face, where I can't find my brave face. My brave, my brave, my brave face, my brave face. I've been livin' a lie, unaccustomed as I am to the work of a housewife. I've been breakin' up, dirty dishes and they throwin' them away. Ever since you left I have been tryin' to compose. A, baby will you please come home, note meant for you. As I clear away another untouched TV dinner. From the table, I laid for two. Now that I'm alone again, I can't stop breakin' down again. The simplest things set me off again, take me to that place. Where I can't find my brave face, where I can't find my brave face. My brave, my brave, my brave face, my brave faceZappin' it to you, the pressure's everywhere. Goin' right through you.

Even when it cuts so deep. It's true I still want you. But the harder I try. The more I seem to lose. I don't want a lover. I just need a friend. I've had time to recover.

Since you been gone I can do whatever I want. I can see whomever I choose. I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant. But nothing. I said nothing can take away these blues. 'Cause nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. It's been so lonely without you here. Like a bird without a song. Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling. Tell me baby where did I go wrong. I could put my arms around every boy I see. But they'd only remind me of you. I went to the doctor and guess what he told me. Guess what he told me. He said girl you better have fun. No matter what you do. But he's a fool. 'Cause nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. All the flowers that you planted, mama. In the back yard. All died when you went away. I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard. But I'm willing to give it another try. Nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. Nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. Nothing compares. Nothing compares to youMadonna. I'm Breathless. Vogue. Strike a pose. Strike a pose. Vogue, vogue, vogue. Vogue, vogue, vogue. . Look around everywhere you turn is heartache.

Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Baby . All right stop, Collaborate and listen . Ice is back with my brand new invention . Something grabs a hold of me tightly . Then I flow like a harpoon daily and nightly . Will it ever stop? Yo -- I don't know . Turn off the lights and I'll glow . To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal . Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle. . . Dance, Bum rush the speaker that booms . I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom . Deadly, when I play a dope melody . Anything less than the best is a felony . Love it or leave it, You better gain way . You better hit bull's eye, The kid don't play . If there was a problem, Yo, I'll solve it . Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it . . Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla . Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla . . Now that the party is jumping . With the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin' . Quick to the point, to the point no faking . I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon . Burning them if they're not quick and nimble . I go crazy when I hear a cymbal . And a hi hat with a souped up tempo . I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo . Rollin' in my 5.0 . With my ragtop down so my hair can blow . The girlies on standby, Waving just to say Hi . Did you stop? No -- I just drove by . Kept on pursuing to the next stop . I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block . That block was dead . . Yo -- so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave. . Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis . Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis . Jealous 'cause I'm out geting mine . Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine . Reading for the chumps on the wall . The chumps acting ill because they're so full of "Eight Ball" . Gunshots ranged out like a bell . I grabbed my nine -- All I heard were shells . Falling on the concrete real fast . Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas . Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed . I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack . Police on the scene, You know what I mean . They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends . If there was a problem, You, I'll solve it .

Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it . My town, that created all the bass sound . Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground . 'Cause my style's like a chemical spill . Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel . Conducted and formed, This is a hell of a concept . We make it hype and you want to step with this . Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja . Cut like a razor blade so fast, Other DJs say, "damn" . If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram . Keep my composure when it's time to get loose . Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice . If there was a problem, Yo -- I'll solve it! . Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it. . . Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla .

I wake up lonely, there's air of silence. In the bedroom and all around. Touch me now, I close my eyes. And dream away. It must have been love but it's over now. It must have been good but I lost it somehow. It must have been love but it's over now. From the moment we touched till the time had run out. Make believing we're together. That I'm sheltered by your heart. But in and outside, I turned to water. Like a teardrop in your palm. And it's a hard winter's day. I dream away. It must have been love but it's over now. It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without. It must have been love but it's over now. It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows. It must have been love but it's over now. It must have been good but I lost it somehow. It must have been love but it's over now. From the moment we touched till the time had run out. Yeah, it must have been love but it's over now. It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without. It must have been love but it's over now. It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows. It must have been love but it's over now. It must have been love but it's over nowI wake up in the morning. And I raise my weary head. I've got an old coat for a pillow. And the earth was last night's bed. I don't know where I'm going. Only God knows where. I've been I'm a devil on the road. A six gun lover. A candle in the wind. When you're brought into this world. They say you're born in sin. Well at least they gave me something. I didn't have to steal or have to win. Well they tell me that I'm wanted. Yeah I'm a wanted man. I'm colt in your stable. I'm what Cain was to Abel. Mister catch me if you can. I'm going down in a blaze of glory. Take me now but know the truth. I'm going down in a blaze of glory. Lord I never drew first. But I drew first blood. I'm no ones son. Call me young gun. You ask about my conscience. And I offer you my soul. You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man. Well I ask if I'll grow old. You ask me if I known love. And what it's like to sing songs in the rain.

Opposites, I said, â€½Opposites attractâ€It was a rainy night when he came into sight. Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat. So I pulled up alongside and I offered him a ride. He accepted with a smile, so we drove for a while. I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain. Fate, tell me it's right, is this love at first sight?. Please don't make it wrong just stay for the night. All I wanna do is make love to you. Say you will, you want me too. All I wanna do is make love to you. I've got lovin' arms to hold on to. So we found this hotel, It was a place I knew well. We made magic that night, oh he did everything right. He brought the woman out of me so many times, easily. And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note. I told him, "I am the flower you are the seed. We walked in the garden, we planted a tree. Don't try to find me, please don't you dare. Just live in my memory, you'll always be there. All I wanna do is make love to you. One night of love was all we knew. All I wanna do is make love to you. I've got lovin' arms to hold on to. We made love, love like strangers. All night long we made love. Then it happened one day we came round the same way. You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes. I said, "Please, please understand, I'm in love with another man. And what he couldn't give me was the one little thing that you can". All I wanna do is make love to you. One night of love was all we knew. All I wanna do is make love to you. Come on say you will, you want me too. All I wanna do is make love to you. One night of love was all we knew. All I wanna do is make love to you. Say you will baby, you want me too. All night long, all night long. All night long, all night long. All I wanna do, all I wanna do. All I wanna do, all I wanna do. All I wanna do is make love to you. One night of love was all we knew, yeah[Feat. Suzanne Vega]. I am sitting in the morning. At the diner on the corner. I am waiting at the counter. For the man to pour the coffee. And he fills it only halfway. And before I even argue. He is looking out the window. At somebody coming in. "It is always nice to see you". Says the man behind the counter. To the woman who has come in. She is shaking her umbrella. And I look the other way. As they are kissing their hellos. I'm pretending not to see them. And instead I pour the milk. I open up the paper. There's a story of an actor. Who had died while he was drinking. It was no one I had heard of. And I'm turning to the horoscope. And looking for the funnies. When I'm feeling someone watching me. And so I raise my head. There's a woman on the outside. Looking inside . Does she see me?. No she does not really see me. Cause she sees her own reflection. And I'm trying not to notice. That she's hitching up her skirt. And while she's straightening her stockings. Her hair is getting wet. Oh, this rain it will continue. Through the morning as I'm listening. To the bells of the cathedral. I am thinking of your voice...I know there's pain. Why do lock yourself up in these chains?. No one can change your life except for you. Don't ever let anyone step all over you. Just open your heart and your mind. Is it really fair to feel this way inside?. Some day somebody's gonna make you want to. Turn around and say goodbye. Until then baby are you going to let them. Hold you down and make you cry. Don't you know?. Don't you know things can change?. Things'll go your way. If you hold on for one more day. Can you hold on for one more day?. Things'll go your way. Hold on for one more day. You could sustain or are you comfortable with the pain?. You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness. You got yourself into your own mess. Lettin' your worries pass you by. Don't you think it's worth your time. To change your mind?. Some day somebody's gonna make you want to. Turn around and say goodbye. Until then baby are you going to let them. Hold you down and make you cry. Don't you know?. Don't you know things can change?. Things'll go your way. If you hold on for one more day. Can you hold on for one more day?. Things'll go your way. Hold on for one more day. I know that there is pain. But you hold on for one more day and. Break free the chains. Yeah, I know that there is pain. But you hold on for one more day and you. Break free, break from the chains. Some day somebody's gonna make you want to. Turn around and say goodbye. Until then baby are you going to let them. Hold you down and make you cry. Don't you know?. Don't you know things can change.

Look around now, these are the days. Of the beggars and the choosers. This is the year of the hungry man. Whose place is in the past. Hand in hand with ignorance. And legitimate excuses. The rich declare themselves poor. And most of us are not sure. If we have too much but we'll take our chances. 'Cause God's stopped keeping score. I guess somewhere along the way. He must have let us all out to play. Turned his back and all God's children. Crept out the back door. And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate. Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of. And the wounded skies above say it's much too much too late. Well maybe we should all be praying for time, oh yeah. These are the days of the empty hand. Oh you hold on to what you can. And charity is a coat. You wear twice a year. This is the year of the guilty man. Your television takes a stand. And you find that what was over there. Is over here. So you scream from behind your door. Say what's mine is mine and not yours. I may have too much but I'll take my chances. 'Cause God's stopped keeping score. And you cling to the things they sold you. Didn't you cover your eyes when they told you?. That he can't come back. 'Cause he has no children to come back for. It's hard to love, there's so much to hate. Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of. And the wounded skies above say it's much too late. So maybe we should all be praying for time, oh yeahDon't you know what you're doin'. You got a death wish. Suicide blonde. Suicide blonde. Suicide blonde. Suicide blonde.

Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear. I think she knew what I wanted to hear. Spinnin' around like a wheel on fire. Walkin' the tightrope on love's highwire. A fatal attraction is where I'm at. There's no escapin' me. I just wanna be close to you. And do all the things you want me to. I just wanna be close to you. And show you the way I feel. I feel love. When I'm lying in the midnight hour. Holding you just like a dream. Love is never what it seems. When we touch. And you're holdin' me the way you feel. Girl, you make my dreams come true. You make my dreams come true. I just wanna be close to you. And do all the things you want me to. I just wanna be close to you. And show you the way I feel. She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars. She holds me back but she goes too far. Windin' me up just to let me down. So emotional gagged and bound. There's more to this than meets the eye. A devil woman locked inside. With the formal risin' I was scared. I think I was possessed. I just wanna be close to you. And do all the things you want me to. I just wanna be close to you. And show you the way I feel. I feel love. Everytime your body's next to mine. Somethin' deep inside of me. Wants to love you endlessly. When we touch. Girl, you don't know how it makes me feel. I just can't believe it's real. I can't believe it's real. I just wanna be close to you. And do all the things you want me to. I just wanna be close to you. And show you the way I feel. She had an attitude I can't explain. You never know if you're in flame. Tying me up with elastic words. I'm on a countdown till I get hurt. Her blood was hot she burned so bright. A neon sign there in the night. It's hard to say if I went too far. My heart still bears a scar. I just wanna be close to you. I just wanna be close to you. I just wanna be close to you. She was a Jezebel, this burstin' queen. Livin' her life like a bad sweet dream. Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear. I think she knew what I wanted to hear. Spinnin' around like a wheel on fire.

From the look upon your face I see it's true. So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'. Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go. Tell me how am I supposed to live without you. Now that I've been lovin' you so long. How am I supposed to live without you. And how am I supposed to carry on. When all that I've been livin' for is gone. I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down. It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end. And how can I blame you when I built my world around. The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends. I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh. Even now it's more than I can take. Tell me how am I supposed to live without you. Now that I've been lovin' you so long. How am I supposed to live without you. And how am I supposed to carry on.

Now that I've been lovin' you so long. How am I supposed to live without you. And how am I supposed to carry on. When all that I've been livin' for is gone. When all that I've been livin' for is gone. No, I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming. Oh, now that your dream has come true. Tell me how am I supposed to live without you. Now that I've been lovin' you so long. How am I supposed to live without you. And how am I supposed to carry on. When all that I've been livin' for is gone. Gone without you. Now that I've been been loving you so long. How am I supposed to live without you. And how am I supposed to carry on. When all that I've been living for is goneI won't let you down. I will not give you up. Gotta have some faith in the sound. It's the one good thing that I've got. I won't let you down. So please don't give me up. Because I would really. Really love to stick around. Heaven knows, I was just a young boy. Didn't know what I wanted to be. I was every little hungry schoolgirl's. Pride and joy. And I guess, it was enough for me. To win the race? A prettier face. Brand new clothes and a big fat place. On your rock and roll TV. But today the way I play the game. Is not the same. No way. Think I'm gonna get me some happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I told you so. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone else I've got to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Take back your singing in the rain. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you and you don't belong to me. Freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Heaven knows, we sure had some fun boy. What a kick just a buddy and me. We had every big shot good-time band. On the run boy. We were living in a fantasy. We won the race. Got out of the place. I went back home, got a brand new face. For the boys on MTV. But today, the way I play the game has got to change. Oh yeah. Now I'm gonna get myself happy. I think there's something you should know. I think it's time I stopped the show. There's something deep inside of me. There's someone I forgot to be. Take back your picture in a frame. Don't think that I'll be back again. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes do not make the man. All we have to do now. Is take these lies and make them true somehow. All we have to see. Is that I don't belong to you and you don't belong to me. Freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Freedom. You've gotta give for what you take. Well, it looks like the road to heaven. But it feels like the road to hell. When I knew which side. My bread was buttered. I took the knife as well posing for another picture. Everybody's got to sell but when you shake your ass. They notice fast. And some mistakes were built to last. That's what you get. I say that's what you get. That's what you get for changing. Your mind. And after all this time. I just hope you understand. Sometimes the clothes. Do not make the man. I'll hold on to my freedom. May not be what you want from me. Just the way it's got to be. Lose the face now , I've got to liveI know that it's time for a change. Mmm but when that change comes. Will it still feel the same?. How many times have I tried. To turn this love around?. I don't wanna give up but, baby. It's time I had two feet on the ground. Can you release me? Can you release me?. Now that you're gone. I can't help myself from wondering. Ohh, if you'd have come down from your high. Would we've been all right?. Release me, can you release me?. Come on, baby, come on, baby. You knew it was time to just let go. 'Cause we wanna be free. But somehow it's just not that easy. Come on, darlin', hear me, darlin'. 'Cause you're a waste of time for me. I'm trying to make you see. That baby, you've just got to release me. Release me, release me. I'm not going back to you anymore. Finally my weakened heart is healing. Though very slow. So stop coming around my door. 'Cause you're not gonna find what you're looking for. Ohh, come on, baby, come on, baby. You knew it was time to just let go. 'Cause we wanna be free. Somehow it's just not that easy. Oh, oh, oh, baby. Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'. 'Cause you're a waste of time for me. I'm trying to make you see. That baby, you've just got to release me. Now tell me. What is this power you've got on me?. What is this power? Ohh. Come on, baby, come on, baby. You knew it was time to just let go. 'Cause we wanna be free. But somehow it's just not that easy. Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby. Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'. 'Cause you're a waste of time for me. I'm trying to make you see. That baby, you've just got to release me. Release me, release me. Release me, will you release me?. Ahh, release me. Release me, will you release me?You know I never meant to see you again. But I only passed by as a friend, yea. All this time I stayed out of sight. I started wondering why. Now I, ooh, now I wish it would rain down, down on me. Ooh, yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now. Ooh, yes I wish it would rain down, down on me. Ooh, yes I wish it would rain on me. You said you didn't need me in your life. Oh I guess you were right, yeah. Ooh I never meant to cause you no pain. But it looks like I did it again, yeah. Now I, now I know, I wish it would rain down, down on me. Ooh, yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now. Ooh girl, I wish it would rain down, down on me. Ooh, yes I wish it would rain on me. Though your hurt is gone. Mine's hanging on inside. And I know it's eating me through, it's eating me through. Every night and day, I'm just waiting on your sign. 'Cause I know, I know, I never meant to cause you no pain. And I realize I let you down, oh yeah. But I know in my heart of heart of hearts. I know I'm never gonna hold you again, no. Now I, now I know, I wish it would rain down, down on me. Ohh, I wish it would rain, rain down on me now. Ooh, I wish it would rain down, down on me. Yes you know I wish it would rain down, rain down over me. Just rain down over me, just let it rain down. Let it rain down, let it rain down, oh yeah. Let it rain down, rain down over me. Just let it rain down, just let it rain down. Let it rain down, just let it rainIt's a human sign. When things go wrong. When the scent of her lingers. And temptation's strong. Into the boundary. Of each married man. Sweet deceit comes calling. And negativity lands. Cold cold heart. Hard done by you. Some things look better baby. Just passing through. And it's no sacrifice. Just a simple word. It's two hearts living. In two separate worlds. But it's no sacrifice. No sacrifice. It's no sacrifice at all. Mutual misunderstanding. After the fact. Sensitivity builds a prison. In the final act. We lose direction. No stone unturned. No tears to damn you. When jealousy burns. Cold, cold heart. Hard done by you. Some things lookin' better, baby. Just passin' through. And it's no sacrifice. Just a simple word. It's two hearts livin'. In two separate world. But, it's no sacrifice. No sacrifice. It's no sacrifice, at all. Cold, cold heart. Hard done by you. Some things lookin' better, baby. Just passin' through. And it's no sacrifice. Just a simple word. It's two hearts livin'. In two separate world. But, it's no sacrifice. No sacrifice. It's no sacrifice, at all. No sacrifice, at all. No sacrifice, at all. No sacrifice, at all. No sacrifice, at allFrom a distance the world looks blue and green. And the snow capped mountains white. From a distance the ocean meets the stream. And the eagle takes to flight. From a distance, there is harmony. And it echoes through the land. It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace. It's the voice of every man. From a distance we all have enough. And no one is in need. And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease. No hungry mouths to feed. From a distance we are instruments. Marching in a common band. Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace. They're the songs of every man. God is watching us, God is watching us. God is watching us from a distance. From a distance you look like my friend. Even though we are at war. From a distance I just cannot comprehend. What all this fighting is for. From a distance there is harmony. And it echoes through the land. And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves. It's the heart of every man. (Every man). It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves. This is the song of every man. And God is watching us, God is watching us. God is watching us from a distance. Oh, God is watching us, God is watching. God is watching us from a distanceThis is a song about those bad days. Start up happy and end up sad days. Talking about that Murphy's law chill. If it can go wrong, yes it will. Went to the store to cop some groceries. Friday night and I had the munchies. Filled the cart till it could not take it. One more bag of chips would break it. Went to the cheek out stood in line. Behind me a girl who was just too fine. Got in the ear while they rang the total. Reached for my wallet uh oh a bolo. Not my day I felt like a dummy. Went to the store and forgot the money. Oops up inside your head. Oops up inside your head. Say oops up. Me and amy under the covers. Scene is hot potential lovers. Demon in the sack is her reputation. In school then she is graduation. Touching holding heavy breathing. I knew I'd get it she is not about teasing. Left on the light so I could see reaction. Amy is a freak guaranteed satisfaction. She is soft as bubble bath. I am as hard as chinese math. Ready for the ultimate affection. Took out a pack obtain my protection. Rolled it on one hard stroke. It was my last and yes it broke. Oops up inside your head. Oops up inside your head. Say oops upBetter make tracks fast on the doubles. The girl's jazzy but she's nothin' but trouble. You take her where she wants to go. And every day you let her know. She's the one who's always on your mind. But she just cops an attitude. Leads you on then leaves you blue. Can't you see she's really just a waste of time?. One day she'll treat you nice. Then she turn as cold as ice. But you think your love will win her. In the end, think again. She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it. All this grief that she's been puttin' you through. She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it. Believe me I know, I know better than. Better than, better than, bet-better than you. Gets you hot then leaves you cold. Keeps you waiting on the phone. 'Cause she knows you'll always give her one more try. You're not the only boy in town. And she loves playin' to the crowd. But tell me do you really like standin' in line. You give her everything you have. And all she does is make you sad. What she really wants to do. Is tell her friends she did it again. She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it. All this grief that she's been puttin' you through. She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it. Believe me I know, I know better than. Better than, better than, bet-better than you. I'd like to say she used to be my girl. But that would be a lie, that would be a lie. 'Cause there's no one in this whole wide world. That could keep her satisfied, I know 'cause I tried. Jump in, one thing I hate is when a girl plays fake. And tries to make me late for another date. 'Cause I've tried to make you mine for the last time. So take this here as a dis and a goodbye. She ain't worth it even though she's on the high tip. She better get a grip, and get a grip quick. Fast in a hurry 'cause I won't buckle. The girl's jazzy but she's nothin' but trouble. Give her everything you have. And all she does is make you sad. What she really wants to do. Is tell her friends she did it again. She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it. All this grief that she's been puttin' you through. She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it. Believe me I know, I know better than. Better than, better than, bet-better than you. ...Oh, just a little bit dangerous. You pack your bag, you take control. You're moving into my heart and into my soul.

Always carrying on with the gang. I'm trying to tell you, boy, it's a mistake. You won't realize 'til it's too late. Don't understand why you insist. On ways of living such a dangerous life. Time after time, you stay away. And I just know that you're telling me lies. Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights. Living on the edge, not afraid to die. Heartbeat, real strong but not for long. Better watch your step or you're gonna die. You're so together, boy but just at a glance. You'll do anything if given a chance. Scheming, planning lies to get what you need. So full of promises that you never keep. Don't you tell yourself that it's okay. Sick and tired of all of your games. And you want me to stay, ah, better change. Makes no sense to me, your crazy ways. Don't understand why you insist. On ways of living such a dangerous life. Time after time, you stay away. And I just know that you're telling me lies. Not afraid to die. Black cat, black cat. Man, I don't understand your ways. Living on the edge. Don't understand why you insist.

Never again. Is what you swore. The time before. Never again. Is what you swore. The time before. . Now you're standing there tongue tied. You'd better learn your lesson well. Hide what you have to hide. And tell what you have to tell. You'll see your problems multiplied. If you continually decide. To faithfully pursue. The policy of truth. . Never again. Is what you swore. The time beforeUB40. Labour Of Love 2. Kingston Town. The night seems to fade,. But the moonlight lingers on. There are wonders for everyone. The stars shine so bright,.

'Dress in white' one said with quotations. from someone's wife, a famous writer. in the nineteen-twenties. When you're young you find inspiration. in anyone who's ever gone. and opened up a closing door. She said we were never feeling bored. 'cause we were never being boring. We had too much time to find for ourselves. and we were never being boring. We dressed up and fought then thought make amends. And we were never holding back or worried that. time would come to an end. When I went I left from the station. with a haversack and some trepidation. Someone said if you're not careful. you'll have nothing left and nothing to care for. in the nineteen-seventies. But I sat back and looking forward. my shoes were high and I had scored. I'd bolted through a closing door. and I would never find myself feeling bored. 'cause we were never being boring. We had too much time to find for ourselves. and we were never being boring. We dressed up and fought then thought make amends. And we were never holding back or worried that. time would come to an end. We were always hoping that, looking back. you could always rely on a friend. Now I sit with different faces. in rented rooms and foreign places. All the people I was kissing. some are here and some are missing. in the nineteen-nineties. I never dreamt that I would get to be. the creature that I always meant to be. but I thought in spite of dreams. you'd be sitting somewhere here with me. 'cause we were never being boring. We had too much time to find for ourselves. and we were never being boring. We dressed up and fought then thought make amends. And we were never holding back or worried that. time would come to an end. We were always hoping that, looking back. you could always rely on a friend. And we were never being boring.

Lord I think he sinned... yeah. Twenty two years of mental tears. cries a suicidal Vietnam vet. Who fought a losing war. on a foreign shore. to find his country didn't want him back. their bullets took his best friend in Saigon. our lawyers took his wife and kids no regrets.

Cause I never meant the things I did". and give me something to believe in. if there's a lord above. and give me something to believe in. oh, lord arise. My best friend died a lonely man. in some Palm Springs hotel room. I got the call last Christmas Eve. and they told me the news.

Oh, lord arise. Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now. things I didn't know then. Road you gotta take me home. Solo. I drive by the homeless. sleepin' on a cold dark street. like bodies in an old bone grave. underneath the broken old neon sign. used to read "Jesus saves". A mile away live the rich folk. and I see how they're livin' it up. but while the poor they eat from hand to mouth. the rich are drinkin' from a golden cup. and it just makes me wonder. why so many lose and so few win... Ha!. Give me something to believe in. give me something to believe in.

Close my eyes and I'm there with you. Like it was yesterday but then it fades away. Take me back, turn back the hands of time. When you kissed me in the warm September rain. (Warm September rain). Back before my heart was filled the pain. If only we could be in love that way again. If whishes came true and all the dreams at night. Of love were real, Id be holding you. If whishes came true. Then I would be that someone. Always special in your heart. We would be still be lovers, not apart. If whishes came true. Now yourè gone and Im on my own. Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye. In my dreams I still feel your touch. Lying next to me feeling esctacy. Take me back turn back the hands of time. When you kissed me in the warm September rain. (Warm September rain). Back before my heart was filled with pain. If only we could be in love that way again. If whishes came true and all the dreams at night. Of love were real I'd be holding you. If whishes came true. Then I would be that someone. Always special in your heart. We would still be lovers not apart. If whishes came true. I love you madly and I need you badly. Give our love more chance. If whishes came true and all the dreams at night. Of love were real I'd be holding you. If whishes came true. Then I would be that someone. Always special in your heart. We would be still be lovers not apart. If whishes came true. EndI've been looking so long at these pictures of you. That I almost believe that they're real. I've been living so long with my pictures of you. That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel. Remembering you, standing quiet in the rain. As I ran to your heart to be near. And we kissed as the sky fell in,  holding you close. How I always held close in your fear. Remembering you, running soft through the night. You were bigger and brighter and whiter than snow. And screamed at the make believe, screamed at the sky. And you finally found all your courage to let it all go. Remembering you, fallen into my arms. Crying for the death of your heart. You were stone white, so delicate,  lost in the cold. You were always so lost in the dark. Remembering you, how you used to be. Slow drowned, you were angels. So much more than everything. Hold for the last time, then slip away quietly. Open my eyes, but I never see anything. If only I'd thought of the right words. I could have held on to your heart. If only I'd thought of the right words. I wouldn't be breaking apart. All my pictures of you. Looking so long at these pictures of you. But I never hold on to your heart. Looking so long for the words to be true. But always just breaking apart. My pictures of you. There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more. Than to feel you deep in my heart. There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more. Than to never feel the breaking apart. My pictures of youHere we are, face to face. We forget, time and place. Hold me now, don't let go. Though it hurts and we both know. The time we spend together's gonna fly. And everything you do to me is gonna feel so right. Baby when you're loving me I feel like I could cry. 'Cause there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you. No, no, no. Here we are, all alone. Trembling hearts, beating strong. Reaching out, breathless kiss. I never thought could feel like this. I want to stop the time from passing by. Wanna close my eyes and feel your lips are touching mine. Baby when you're close to me I want you more each time. And there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you. There's nothing I can do, I'm helpless in your arms. Baby what you do, I'm in love, this is it. There's no turning back this time. No, no, no. Here we are, once again. But this time we're only friends. Funny world, sometimes lies. Become the game, when love's the prize. And though no one knows what's going on inside. And all the love I feel for you is something I should hide. When I have you close to me, the feeling's so sublime. That there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you. No, no, no, can't keep from loving you, baby. No, no, no. There's nothing I can do, my baby. Can't keep from loving youGo West. Indian Summer/Aces and Kings. The King Of Wishful Thinking.

Did you know, did you know. Did you knowOh, baby child. It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky. It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight. They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon. You know I don't see you when she walks in the room. It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help. It's no secret that a liar won't believe in anyone else. They say a secret is something you tell one other person. So I'm telling you, child. Oh love, we shine like a burning star. We're falling from the sky tonight. A man will beg. A man will crawl. On the sheer face of love. Like a fly on a wall. It's no secret at all. It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest. It's no secret, ambition bites the nails of success. Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief. All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief. Oh love, we shine like a burning star. We're falling from the sky tonight. A man will rise. A man will fall. From the sheer face of love. Like a fly from a wall. It's no secret at all. Oh love, we shine like a burning star. We're falling from the sky tonight. Oh love, we shine like a burning star. We're falling from the sky tonight. A man will rise. A man will fall. From the sheer face of love. Like a fly from a wall. It's no secret at all. It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky. The universe exploded 'cause of one man's lie. Look, I gotta go, yeah, I'm running outta change. There's a lot of things if I could I'd rearrangeYo, hey what's happening dude?. I'm a guy with a rep for bein' rude. Terrorizin' people wherever I go. It's not intentional, just keepin' the flow. Fixin' test scores to get the best scores. Droppin' banana peels all over the floor. I'm the kid that made delinquency an art. Last name, Simpson, first name, Bart. I'm here today to introduce the next phase. The next step in the big Bart craze. I got a dance, real easy to do. I learned it with no rhythm and so can you. So, move your body, if you got the notion. Front to back in a rock-like motion. Now that you got it, if you think you can. Do it to the music, that's the Bartman. Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman. Shake you body, turn it out, if you can, man. Move you butt to the side, yes, you can, can. Everybody in the house, do the Bartman. Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman. Shake you body, turn it out, if you can, man. Move you butt to the side, yes, you can, can. Everybody in the house, do the Bartman. It wasn't long ago, just a couple of weeks. I got in trouble, yeah, pretty deep. Homer was yellin', mom was, too. Because I put mothballs in the beef stew. Punishment time, in the air lurks gloom. Sittin' by myself, confined to my room. When all else fails, nothin' else left to do. I turn on the music, so I can feel the groove. Move your body, if you got the notion. Front to back in a rock-like motion. Move your hips from side to side now. Don't ya slip, let your feet glide now. If you've got the groove, you gotta use it. Rock rhythm in time with the music. You just might start a chain reaction. If you can do the Bart, you're bad like Michael Jackson. Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman. Shake you body, turn it out, if you can, man. Move your butt to the side as you can, can. Everybody in the house, do the Bartman, do the Bartman. Do the Bartman, everybody, back and forth, from side to side. Do the Bartman, do the Bartman. Now, here's a dance beat that you can't deny. Turn it down will you stop that infernal racket?. Do the Bartman. Oh my ears, Lisa, put that saxophone away. You can't touch this, I didn't do it, nobody saw me do it. You can't prove anything. Now, I'm in the house feelin' good to be home. 'Til Lisa starts blowin' her damn saxophone. And if it was mine, you know they'd take it away. But still I'm feelin' good, so that's okay. I'm up in my room, just a-singin' a song. Listenin' to the kicks while I'm kickin' along. Yeah, Lisa likes jazz, she's her number one fan. But I know I'm bad, 'cause I do the Bartman. Everybody, if you can do the Bartman. Shake your body, turn it out if you can, man. Move your butt to the side, as you can, can. Everybody in the house, do the Bartman, do the Bartman. Do the Bartman. Everybody, back and forth from side to side. Do the Bartman, do the Bartman. She can do it, he can do it, so can I. If you've got the groove, you gotta use it. Rock rhythm in time with the music. You just might start a chain reaction. I'm a Bartman, everybody, if you can, do the Bartman. Shake your body, turn it out, if you can, man. Move your butt to the side, as you can, can. Everybody in the house do the Bartman. Move you body, if you got the notion. Skake your body to the rock like motion. Move your hips from side to side now. Don't ya slip, let your feet glide now. If you've got your groove, you gotta use it. Rock rhythm in time with the music. Eat your heart out, Michael. You just might start a chain reaction. Oh, wow, manKlf. Miscellaneous. 3am Eternal Mumu. 3 A.M.

Because I love you, I'll do anything. I'll give you my heart, my everything. Because I love you, I'll be right by your side. To be a light, to be your guide.

Down in the gutter, life is slippin' away. Let me still exist in another place. Runnin' under cover, of a helicopter blade. . Flames are getting higher in effigy. Burnin' down the bridges of my memory. Love may still be alive somewhere, some way. Where they're downin' only deer. A hundred steel towns away. . Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beatin' like a drum. With the words "I love you" rollin' off my tongue. No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home. Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailin'. . Photographs, kerosene, light up my darkness. Light it up, light it up, light it up. I can still feel the touch, of your thin blue jeans. Runnin' down the alley, I've got my eyes all over you, baby. Oh baby. . Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beatin' like a drum. With the words "I love you" rollin' off my tongue. No, never will I roam, for I know my place is home. Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing, I'll be sailing. . Oh, I've got lightning in my veins. Shifting like the handle of a slot machine. Love may still exist in another place. I'm just yanking back the handle, no expression on my face. . Oh, the rhythm of my heart is beatin' like a drum. With the words "I love you" rollin' off my tongue. Oh, never will I roam, for I know my place is home. Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailin'. .

To find a heart that's made of stone. I will try. I just need a little time. To get your face right out of my mind. To see the world through different eyes. Everytime I see you. Oh, I try to hide away. But when we meet it seems I can't let go. Everytime you leave the room. I feel I'm fading like a flower. Tell me why. When I scream, there's no reply. When I reach out, there's nothing to find. When I sleep, I break down and cry. Cry, yeah. Everytime I see you. Oh, I try to hide away. But when we meet it seems I can't let go. Everytime you leave the room. I feel I'm fading like a flower. Fading like a rose. Fading like a rose. Beaten by the storm. Talking to myself. Getting washed by the rain. It's such a cold, cold town.

Thinks that I am unforgettable tooWell the key to my survival. was never in much doubt. the question was how I could keep sane. trying to find a way out. Things were never easy for me. peace of mind was hard to find. and I needed a place where I could hide. somewhere I could call mine. I didn't think much about it. til it started happening all the time. soon I was living with the fear everyday. of what might happen that night. I couldn't stand to hear the. crying of my mother. and I remember when. I swore that, that would be the. Last they'd see of me. And I never went home again. they say that time is a healer. and now my wounds are not the same. I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth. I had to hear what he'd say. He sat me down to talk to me. he looked me straight in the eyes. he said:. You're no son, you're no son of mine. You're no son, you're no son of mine. You walked out, you left us behind. and you're no son, no son of mine. oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it. and as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it. You're no son, you're no son of mine. but where should I go,. and what should I do. you're no son, you're no son of mine. but I came here for help, oh I came here for you. Well the years they passed so slowly. I thought about him everyday. what would I do, if we passed on the street. would I keep running away. in and out of hiding places. soon I'd have to face the facts. we'd have to sit down and talk it over. and that would mean going back. they say that time is a healer. and now my wounds are not the same. I rang that bell with my heart in my mouth. I had to hear what he'd say. He sat me down to talk to me. he looked me straight in the eyes. he said:. You're no son, you're no son of mine. You're no son, you're no son of mine. When you walked out, you left us behind. and you're no son, you're no son of mine. oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it. and as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it. You're no son, you're no son of mine. But where should I go and what should I do. You're no son, you're no son of mine. But I came here for help, oh I was looking for you. You're no son, you're no son of mine - oh. You're no son - ha yeah, ha yeah, ha yeah, ha yeah. You're no son, you're no son of mine - oh, oh...Shiny happy people laughing.

I saw a city in the fog and an old church tower. Where the seagulls play. Saw the sad shire horses walking home. In the sodium light. Saw two priests on the ferry. October geese on a cold winter's night. And all this time. The river flowed. Endlessly. To the sea. Two priests came round our house tonight. One young, one old. To offer prayers for the dying. To serve the final rite. One to learn, one to teach. Which way the cold wind blows. Fussing and flapping in priestly black. Like a murder of crows. And all this time, the river flowed. Endlessly. to the sea. If I had my way, I'd take a boat from the river. And I'd bury the old man. I'd bury him at sea. Blessed are the poor. for they shall inherit the earth. (One is) Better to be poor than a fat man in the eye of a needle. And as these words were spoken i swear i hear. The old man laughing,. 'what good is a used up world, and how could it be. Worth having'. And all this time the river flowed. Endlessly like a silent tear. And all this time the river flowed. Father, if jesus exists,. Then how come he never lived here?. Yeah, yeah. Teachers told us. The romans built this place. They built a wall and a temple on the edge of the. Empire garrison town,. They lived and they died. They prayed to their gods. But the stone gods did not make a sound. And their empire crumbled. 'Til all that was left. Were the stones the workmen found. And all this time the river flowed. In the falling light of a northern sun. If i had my way. I'd take a boat from the river. Men go crazy in congregations. But they only get better. One by one. One by one, by one. One by one. I looked out across. The river today. I saw a city in the fog and an old church tower. Where the seagulls play. Saw the sad shire horses walking home. In the sodium light. Saw two priests on the ferry. October geese on a cold winter's nightBirds fly, they don't think twice. They simply spread their wings. The sun shines, it don't ask why. Or what the whole thing means. The same applies to you and I. We never question that. So good, it's just understood. Ain't no conjecture, it's just a matter of fact. Love is a wonderful thing. Make ya smile through the pouring rain. Love is a wonderful thing. I'll say it again and again. Turn your world into one sweet dream. Take your heart and make it sing. Love, love, love is a wonderful thing. Oh yeah. The only thing a river knows. Is runnin' to the sea. And every spring when a flower grows. It happens naturally. The same magic when you're in my arms. No logic can define, oh no. Don't know why, just feels so right. I only know it happens every time. Love is a wonderful thing. Make ya smile through the pouring rain. Love is a wonderful thing. I'll say it again and again. Turn your world into one sweet dream. Take your heart and make it sing. Love, love, love is a wonderful thing. Oh, when the cold wind blows. I know you're gonna be there to warm me. That's what keeps me goin'. And our sweet love gonna keep on growin', just keep on growin'. Love is a wonderful thing. Make ya smile through the pouring rain. Love is a wonderful thing, oh yeah. I'll say it again and again. And turn your world into one sweet dream. Take your heart and make it sing. It's love, love, love is a wonderful. Love, love, love is a wonderful. Love, love, love is a wonderful thing. Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing. Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing.

Here it is the groove slightly transformed. just a bit of a break from the norm. just a little somethin' to break the monotony. of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be. a little bit out of control it's cool to dance. but what about the groove that soothes that moves romance. give me a soft subtle mix. and if ain't broke then don't try to fix it. and think of the summers of the past. adjust the base and let the alpine blast. pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme. and put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime. Chorus. Verse Two: Fresh Prince. school is out and it's a sort of a buzz. but back then I didn't really know what it was. but now I see what have of this. the way that people respond to summer madness. the weather is hot and girls are dressing less. and checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best. ridin around in your jeep or your benzos. or in your nissan stting on lorenzos. back in Philly we be ou in the park. a place called the plateau is where everybody go. guys out hunting and girls doing likewise. honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes. she turn around to see what you beeping at. it's like the summers a natural afrodesiac. and with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme. to hit you and get you equipped for the summer time. Chorus. Verse Three: Fresh Prince. it's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet. hustle to the mall to get me a short set. yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair. cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there. the temperature's about 88. hop in the water plug just for old times sake. break to ya crib change your clothes once more. cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4. sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise. about the days growing up and the first person you kissed. and as I think back makes me wonder how. the smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia. all the kids playing out front. little boys messin round with the girls playing double-dutch. while the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion. then six o'clock rolls around. you just finished wiping your car down. it's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout. it looks like a car show. everybody come lookin real fine. fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon. every moment frontin and maxin. chillin in the car they spent all day waxin. leanin to the side but you can't speed through. two miles an hour so everybody sees you. there's an air of love and of happiness. and this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion of summer madness. ChorusWe're starting it over. We're making way for destiny. A time to turnover. A better life for you and me. A new recreation. To channel all this energy. Let's solve the equation. I need to feel, you close to me. So baby let your conscience go. There's no turning back when love takes hold. Hold me baby, drive me crazy. Touch me all night long. Make me love you, kiss and hug you. Touch me all night long. The more that I see you. The more I know that love belongs. With you in my mind boy. I wouldn't know what's right from wrong. 'Cause love will takeover. And leave you out of sight and mind. You've got to go with the feeling. And trust fate to be kind. And baby let your conscience go. There's no turning back when love takes hold. Hold me baby, drive me crazy. Touch me all night long. Make me love you, kiss and hug you. Touch me all night long. Hold me baby, drive me crazy. Touch me all night long. Make me love you, kiss and hug you. Touch me all night long. And baby let your conscience go. There's no turning back once love gets hold. Hold me baby, drive me crazy. Touch me all night long. Make me love you, kiss and hug you. Touch me all night long. Hold me baby, drive me crazy. Touch me all night long. Make me love you, kiss and hug you. Touch me all night long. Hold me baby, drive me crazy. Touch me all night longWhen a man loves a woman. Can't keep his mind on nothin' else. He'd trade the world. For the good thing he's found. If she is bad, he can't see it. She can do no wrong. And turn his back on his best friend. If he puts her down. When a man loves a woman. Spend his very last dime. And trying to hold on to what he needs. He'd give up all his comforts. And sleep out in the rain. If she said that's the way, it ought to be. When a man loves a woman. I give you everything I've got. Trying to hold on to your precious love. And baby baby please don't treat me bad. When a man loves a woman. Deep down in his soul. She can bring him such misery. If she is playing him for a fool. He's the last one to know. Loving eyes can never see. Yes when a man loves a woman. I know exactly how he feels. 'Cause baby, baby. When a man loves a woman. When a man loves a woman. When a man loves a woman. When a man, when a man. When a man loves a womanArmy with harmony. Dave drop a load on 'em. OPP how can I explain it. I'll take you frame by frame it. To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it. O is for other P is for people scratchin' temple. The last P, well, that's not that simple. It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten. It's five little letters that are missin' here. You get on occassion at the other party. As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'. Bust it. You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello. You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow. You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about. Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house. It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T. It's just her boyfriend's at her house. (Boy, that's what is scary). It's OPP, time other people's what you get it. There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it. How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at. Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at. Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it. But if you don't, here's your membership. You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (Every last homie). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (All the homies). As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted. The first two letters are the same. But the last is something different. It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest. It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest. I won't get into that, I'll do it, ah, sorta properly. I say the last P hmm stands for property. Now lady here comes a kiss. Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly. Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife?. And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice?. You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away. That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway?. You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care. 'Cos in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there. When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know. And then y'all could throw the skeleton bone right in the closet door. Now don't be shocked 'cos if you're down I want your hands up high. Say "OPP," "OPP!" I like to say with pride. Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts. You're now down with a discount. You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (Every last lady). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (All the ladies). This girl ah tried to OPP me. I had a girl and she knew that matter of fact. My girl was partner's that had a fall out. Disagreement, yeah an argument. She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it. That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling. 'Cos after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings. I said, "Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave". She said, "Oh no, I love you Treach" I said, "Now child please". You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go. I said, "Now look you to the stairs and to the stairwindow. This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart. 'Cos you know I was OPP, hell from the very start". Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about. When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth. That's rule number one in this OPP establishment. You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him. Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business. Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with. Him or her for sure is going to admit it. When OPP comes, damn, skippy I'm with it. You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (This whole party). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). You down with OPP?. (Yeah you know me). Who's down with OPP?. (This whole party). Break it downEagle's calling and he's calling your name. Tides are turning, bringing winds of change. Why do I feel this way?.

My boy kept tellin' me. Yo, I don't know. I think your girl's been playing tic tac toe. I'll ask my girl I know she only loves me. Wasn't I the one who tool your viginity?. The look on her face read sorrow and gloom. She said "Yeah, Why do you guys always ask that?". . (Chorus). Things that make you go hmm. Things that make you go hmm. It's the things that make you go hmm. . (Repeat Chorus). . Hey ladies. Have you ever had a man. Go away for business, come back with a tan. Comes home late at night from work. You cooked him dinner now you feel like a jerk. Sayin' he didn't have time to eat. And he's not even hungry, he wants to be treat. To the bedroom he said his head hurts. You're only makin' love in radical spurts. Mysterious calls and the phone goes click. You say to yourself  "I'm gonna hit him with a brick". Ain't no way he could be cheatin' on me. I wonder who bought him those BVD's. Dressed to a T to hang with the fellas. Over the guys and I'm getting jealous. Comin' home late smellin' like perfume (fume). . (Repeat Chorus x7). .

Surrender your ego be free, be free to yourself. . If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky. If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die. If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask. Show yourself, destroy our fears, release your mask. . Oh yes we'll keep on trying, hey tread that fine line. Yeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah. Yeah, yeah and whatever will be, will be. We'll keep on trying, we'll just keep on trying. Till the end of time, till the end of time, till the end of timeOoh.

Another hero, another mindless crime. Behind the curtain, in the pantomime. Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore. The show must go on,. The show must go on. Inside my heart is breaking. My make-up may be flaking. But my smile still stays on.. Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance. Another heartache, another failed romance. On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?. I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now. I'll soon be turning, round the corner now. Outside the dawn is breaking. But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free. The show must go on. The show must go on. Inside my heart is breaking. My make-up may be flaking. But my smile still stays on. My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies. Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die. I can fly - my friends. The show must go on. The show must go on. I'll face it with a grin. I'm never giving in. On - with the show -. I'll top the bill, I'll overkill. I have to find the will to carry on. On with the -. On with the show -. The show must go on...Once again we sit in silence. After all is said and done. Only emptiness inside us. Baby, look what we've become. We can make a million promises. But we still won't change. It isn't right to stay together. When you only bring each other pain. I don't wanna cry,  don't wanna cry. Nothing in the world could take us back. To where we used to be. Though I've give you my heart and soul. I must find a way of letting go. 'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry. Too far apart to bridge the distance. But something keeps us hanging on and on. Pretending not to know the difference. Denying what we had is gone. Every moment we're together. It's just breaking me down. I know we swore it was forever. But it hurts too much to stay around. I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry. Nothing in the world could take us back. To where we used to be. Though I've given you my heart and soul. I must find a way of letting go. 'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry, no, no, no. All the magic's gone. There's just a shadow of a memory. Something just went wrong. We can't go on make believing, on make believing. I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry. Nothing in the world could take us back. To where we used to be. Though I've given you my heart and soul. Though I've given you my heart and soul oh baby. I must find a way of letting go. 'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, cry. I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cryI'm talking, I'm talking. I believe in the power of love. I'm singing, I'm singing. I believe that you can rescue me. With you I'm not a little girl, with you I'm not a man. When all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand. You see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak. You see that I am silly, and pretentious and a freak. But I don't feel too strange for you, don't know exactly what you do. I think when love is pure, you try to understand the reasons why. And I prefer this mystery, it cancels out my misery. And gives me hope that there could be a person that loves me. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. Your love has given me hope. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. I'm drowning, baby, throw out your rope. With you I'm not a fascist, can't play you like a toy. And when I need to dominate, you're not my little boy. You see that I am hungry for a life of understanding. And you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding. You bring me to my knees while I'm scratching out the eyes. Of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise. And right while I am kneeling there, I suddenly begin to care. And understand that there could be a person that loves me. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. Your love has given me hope. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope. Love is understanding. It's hard to believe life can be so demanding. I'm sending out an SOS. Stop me from drowning baby, I'll do the rest. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. Your love has given me hope. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. I'm drowning, baby, throw out your rope. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. Your love has given me hope. Rescue me, it's hard to believe. I'm drowning, baby, throw out your rope. Ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding. Ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding. Love is understanding. It's hard to believe life can be so demanding. I'm sending out an SOS. Rescue me, rescue me. It's not my business to decide how good you are for me. How valuable you are and what the world can see. Only that you try to understand me. And have the courage to love me for me. I believe, I believe in the power of love. I believe that you can rescue me. I believe, I believe in the power of love. I believe that you can rescue me. I'm singing I believe. I believe that you can rescue me. I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing. I believe that you can rescue me. I'm talking, I'm talking. I believe in the power of love. I'm talking, I'm talking. I believe in the power of love. I'm singing, I'm singing, I believe. I believe that you can rescue me. Hey hey, hey hey. R E S C U E me. Only you can rescue me. Hey hey, heyDon't let yourself be hurt this time. Don't let yourself be hurt this time. Then I saw your face. Then I saw your smile. The sky is still blue. The clouds come and go. Yet something is different. Are we falling in love?. Don't let yourself be hurt this time. Don't let yourself be hurt this time. Then your kiss so soft. Then your touch so warm. The stars still shine bright. The mountains still high. Yet something is different. Are we falling in love?. Falling, falling. Are we falling in love?. Falling, falling. Are we falling in love?Some things in life are bad. They can really make you mad. Other things just make you swear and curse. When you're chewing on life's gristle. Don't grumble, give a whistle. And this'll help things turn out for the best. And always look on the bright side of life. Always look on the light side of life. If life seems jolly rotten. There's something you've forgotten. And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing. When you're feeling in the dumps. Don't be silly chumps. Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing. And always look on the bright side of life. Come on!. Always look on the right side of life. For life is quite absurd. And death's the final word. You must always face the curtain with a bow. Forget about your sin. Give the audience a grin. Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow. So, always look on the bright side of death. A-just before you draw your terminal breath. Life's a piece of shit. When you look at it. Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true. You'll see it's all a show. Keep 'em laughing as you go. Just remember that the last laugh is on you. And always look on the bright side of life. Always look on the right side of life. C'mon Brian, cheer up!. Always look on the bright side of life. Always look on the bright side of life. Worse things happen at sea, you know. Always look on the bright side of life. I mean, what have you got to lose. You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing. What have you lost? Nothing!. Always look on the right side of life.... Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?. Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!. There you are, see, it's the end of the film. Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer. Some of us have to got live as well, you know. Who do you think pays for all this rubbish.

The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young. The sun was always shinin' we just lived for fun. Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know. The rest of my life's been just a show. Those were the days of our lives. The bad things in life were so few. Those days are all gone now but one thing is true. When I look and I find, I still love you. You can't turn back the clock. You can't turn back the tide, ain't that a shame?. I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride. When life was just a game. No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did. When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids. Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know. Better sit back and go with the flow. These are the days of our lives. They've flown in the swiftness of time. These days are all gone now but somethings remain. When I look and I find, no change. Those were the days of our lives, yeah. The bad things in life were so few. Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true. When I look and I find, I still love you, I still love youAh yeah, huh. America the beautiful. Huh, yeah, let me introduce y'all to the Wildside. Annie was a high school cheerleader. Pom, poms and bobby socks, no girl was sweeter. Come Prom time, everybody was on the line. All the fellas swinging nickel and dime. Tales about love and lust and trust. But Annie took it all in stride. 'Cause deep inside Annie had aspirations. Wanted to be a chemical engineer. Making 50 to 55 thousand a year. Her first year of college was a success. But along came Billy possessed and obsessed. He took Annie on a fatal date. And showed her things that make heartbeats accelerate. Annie took a hit, breathed two short breaths. One for life, the last for death. Now she's gone, a former Valedictorian. Ended up becoming a topic for historians. Washe up dreams and shattered pride. All because Annie took a hit on the Wildside. Ron had enough of being broke everyday. Saying to himself, there's gotta be a betta way. 'Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches. So Ron figured out a faster way to make money. Before you know it, he's a rich man. Gold on every finger of his hand. A brand new BMW, a condo. Ron ended up a John Doe. A body was found in the alley but never clained. Full of bullet holes but none to blame. Ron became another victim of homicide. Because he chose to walk on the Wildside. Charles had everything going for him. A top paying job, a good life, a good wife. A baby boy on the way any day. A gentleman attitude is all he displayed. Carol was the wife he loved and adored. Her family and friends treated him like an Ambassador. One night on the other side of town. A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound. Charles on the car phone asking for help. Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself. His pregnant wife lay slumped over. Dreams corrupted and a young life over. Extensive searches throughout the projects. Put a lot of people through misery and wreck. Everyone a suspect til' someone was found. Interrogated 'cause their skin was brown. Then there was Bennett, guilty until proven so. But soon as the case started moving slow. What do you know, sure as as sea gull gets webbed toed. Charles was the culprit. The whole plot was an insurance scam. Charles and his brother came up with a plan. Kill Carol, collect a big check. Blame it on a black man, what the heck?. And just before the story was known. Charles had a feeling that his cover was blown. So he jumped off a bridge, committed suicide. This is how it is on the Wildside. Little Tiffany, only thirteen. Came to the city, place of big dreams. Visiting family and friends for the summertime. Sittin' on a mailbox, watchin' the boys climb trees. And the girls play hopscotch. So far, her vacation was top notch. Then out of the blue, a Mercedes at top speed. Gang bangers chasin' the robbers on the stampede. Quick as a blink shots rang out loud. And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd. One hit Tiffany and instantly she died. Innocently on the WildsideStrike it up, this band is gonna play my tune. Strike it up, I wanna I wanna tell you so. Strike it up, nobody's gonna stop my sound. Strike it up, you know how lonely one can feel. If I have the line and you have the bass. Then strike it up and you'll find the rhythm's on time. Line after line, going straight to your mind. 'Cause hyping the place is what we're all about. Moving your waist to the bass is no doubt. Roll up the groove, melody is essential. Drop the knowledge on this instrumental. Dance your doubts about house music. You've got the body so why don't you use it?. Naturally swinging your thing to the song. 'Cause that's how we pump the dance floor for the strong. Waiting on my feelings, yeah, yeah. Waiting on my feelings, feelings. Waiting on my feelings, yeah, yeah. Waiting on my feelings, feelings. Strike it up, your hand is taping on my skin. Strike it up, and keep me and keep me standing on.

Strike it up. Strike it upI remember how. The sun came shining through the trees. Made shadows on the road. I was driving home. The morning after with the taste of you. Still on my tongue. You are my safety zone. I live and breathe in you. I'll never find a better love not in a minute. I'll never find a better love not in a minute. Never a better love, never a better love. On the harbour bridge. The rain was gently falling down. On a lazy summer day. Your face appeared there on my windscreen. You smiled and slipped away. You are my safety zone. I live and breathe in you. I'll never find a better love not in a minute. I'll never find a better love not in a minute. Never a better love, never a better love. You are my safety zone. I live and breathe in you. You are where I belong. I live and breathe in you. I'll never find a better love not in a minute ...You can reach me by railway, you can reach me by trailway.

Whenever I was in need of a friend. Why did it have to end. And why do they always say. Don't look back, keep your head held high. Don't ask them why because life is short. And before you know, you're feeling old. And your heart is breaking. Don't hold on to the past. Well, that's too much to ask. This used to be my playground. This used to be my childhood dream. This used to be the place I ran to. Whenever I was in need of a friend. Why did it have to end. And why do they always say. No regrets but I wish that you were here with me. Well, then there's hope yet. I can see your face in our secret place. You're not just a memory. Say goodbye to yesterday. Those are words I'll never say. This used to be my playground. This used to be our pride and joy. This used to be the place we ran to. That no one in the world could dare destroy. This used to be our playground. This used to be our childhood dream.

And now we're standing face-to-face. Isn't this world a crazy place?. Just when I thought our chance had passed. You go and save the best for last. All of the nights you came to me. When some silly girl had set you free. You wondered how you'd make it through. I wondered what was wrong with you. 'Cause how could you give your love to someone else. And share your dreams with me.

I love your smile, baby. I love your smile. I really doI saw you dancin' out the ocean. Running fast along the sand. A spirit born of earth and water. Fire flying from your hands. In the instant that you love someone. In the second that the hammer hits. Reality runs up your spine. And the pieces finally fit. And all I ever needed was the one. Like freedom fields where wild horses run. When stars collide like you and I. No shadows block the sun. You're all I've ever needed. Babe, you're the one. There are caravans we follow. Drunken nights in dark hotels. When chances breathe between the silence. Where sex and love no longer gel. For each man in his time is Cain. Until he walks along the beach. And sees his future in the water. A long lost heart within his reach. And all I ever needed was the one. Like freedom fields where wild horses run. When stars collide like you and I. No shadows block the sun. You're all I've ever needed. Ooh babe, you're the one. And all I ever needed was the one. Like freedom fields where wild horses run. When stars collide like you and I. No shadows block the sun. You're all I've ever needed. Ooh babe, you're the one. And all I ever needed was the one. Like freedom fields where wild horses run. When stars collide like you and I.

When I wonder why are the seas still dry?. Don't blame this sleeping satellite. Did we fly to the moon too soon?. Did we squander the chance? In the rush of the race. The reason we chase is lost in romance. And still we try to justify the waste. For a taste of man's greatest adventure. I blame you for the moonlit sky. And the dream that died with the Eagle's flight. I blame you for the moonlit nights. When I wonder why are the seas still dry?. Don't blame this sleeping satellite. Have we got what it takes to advance?. Did we peak too soon? If the world is so green. Then why does it scream under a blue moon?. We wonder why the earth's sacrificed. For the price of its greatest treasure. I blame you for the moonlit sky. And the dream that died with the Eagle's flight. I blame you for the moonlit nights. When I wonder why are the seas still dry?. Don't blame this sleeping satellite. And when we shoot for the stars. What a giant step have we got what it takes. To carry the weight of this concept?. Or pass it by like a shot in the dark. Miss the mark with a sense of adventure. I blame you for the moonlit sky. And the dream that died with the Eagle's flight. I blame you for the moonlit nights. When I wonder why are the seas still dry?. Don't blame this sleeping satelliteLove's like a road that you travel on. When there's one day here and the next day gone. Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand. Sometimes you turn your back to the wind. There's a world outside every darkened door. Where blues won't haunt you anymore. Where the brave are free and lovers soar. Come ride with me to the distant shore. We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate. There's not much time left today. Life is a highway. I want to ride it all night long. If you're going my way. I want to drive it all night long. Through all these cities and all these towns. It's in my blood and it's all around. I loved you now like I loved you then. This is the road and these are the ends. From Mozambique to those Memphis nights. The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights. Knock me down, I'm back up again. You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man. There's no load I can't hold. A road so rough this I know. I'll be there when the light comes in. Just tell 'em we're survivors. Life is a highway. I want to ride it all night long. And if you're going my way. I want to drive it all night long. Life is a highway. I want to ride it all night long. If you're going my way. I want to drive it all night long. There was a distance between you and I. A misunderstanding once. But now we look it in the eye. There ain't no load that I can't hold. A road so rough, this I know. I'll be there when the light comes in. Just tell 'em we're survivors. Life is a highway. I want to ride it all night long. If you're going my way. I want to drive it all night long.

Said with prejudiced eyes. . That boy's not right, three years ago. When I came to know Mary. First time that someone looked beyond the rumors. And the lies and saw the man inside. . We used to walk down by the river. She loved to watch the sun go down. We used to walk along the river. And dream our way out of this town. . No one understood what I felt for Mary. No one cared until the night. She went out walking alone. And never came home. . Man with a badge came. Knocking next morning, here was I surrounded. By a thousand fingers suddenly. Pointed right at me. . I swear, I left her by the river. I swear, I left her safe and sound. I need to make it to the river. And leave this old Nebraska town. . I think about my life gone by. And how it's done me wrong. There's no escape for me this time. All of my rescues are gone, long gone. . I swear, I left her by the river. I swear, I left her safe and sound. I need to make it to the river. And leave this old Nebraska townThere's a place in your heart. And I know that it is love. And this place could be much. Brighter than tomorrow.

Though it's plain to see. This world is heavenly. Be God's glow. We could fly so high. Let our spirits never die. In my heart I feel you are all my brothers. Create a world with no fear. Together we'll cry happy tears. See the nations turn their swords. Into plowshares. We could really get there. If you cared enough for the living. Make a little space. To make a better place.

A place to find myself again, you know”. Oh yeah, I know a goodbye when I hear it. She smiles but her heart's already out there. Walking down the street. She says. “I don't want nobody else, I love you”. She's lying. “There won't be somebody else and that's true”. She's lying. “Say you'll always be my friend, sweet darling”. Why does she pretend?. Ain't no doubt, it' plain to see. A woman like you's no good for me. Your heart beating at another door. I'm a damned fool for to ask for more. She says, “It's like in a song, remember. If you love someone, set them free”. Well, that's how it is for me and then she kisses me. And somewhere I hear a door slam, so I say, “Fine”. And just hope that I'm a better liar than she is. She says. “I don't want nobody else, I love you”. She's lying. “There won't be somebody else and that's true”. She's lying. “Say you'll always be my friend, sweet darling”. Why does she pretend?.

No one in the whole universe will ever compare. I am yours now and you are mine. And together we'll love through. All space and time, so don't cry. One day all 7 will die. All 7 and we'll watch them fall. They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all. With an intellect and a savior-faire. No one in the whole universe will ever compare. I am yours now and you are mine. And together we'll love through. All space and time, so don't cry. One day all 7 will die. And I saw an Angel come down unto me. In her hand she holds the very key. Words of compassion, words of peace. And in the distance an army's marching feet.   (1 2 3 4 - 1 2 3 4). But behold, we will watch them fall. And we lay down on the sand of the sea. And before us animosity will stand and decree. That we speak not of love only blasphemy. And in the distance, 6 others will curse me. But that's alright. (That's alright). 4 I will watch them fall. (1 2 3 4 5 6 7). All 7 and we'll watch them fall. They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all. With an intellect and a savior-faire. No one in the whole universe will ever compare. I am yours now and you are mine. And together we'll love through. All space and time, so don't cry. One day all 7 will die. (Just how old). And we will see a plague and a river of blood. And every evil soul will surely die in spite of. Their 7 tears, but do not fear. 4 in the distance, 12 souls from now. You and me will still be here, we will still be here. There will be a new city with streets of gold. The young so educated they never grow old. And a there will be no death for with every breath. The voice of many colors sings a song. That's so bold. Sing it while we watch them fall. All 7 and we'll watch them fall. They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all. With an intellect and a savior-faire. No one in the whole universe will ever compare. I am yours now and you are mine. And together we'll love through. All space and time, so don't cry. One day all 7 will die. Just how old. Just how old. Just how oldLord, I've really been real stressed, down and out, losing ground.. Although I am black and proud, problems got me pessimistic.. Brothers and sisters keep messin' up, why does it have to be so damn tuff?. I don't know where I can go to let these ghosts out of my skull.. My grandma past my brother's gone, I never at once felt so alone.. I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel, not just my spare tire.. (Home!) But Lord, I ask you,. (Home!) to be my guiding force and truth.. (Home!) For some strange reason it had to be,. (Home!) he guided me to Tennessee.. (Home!) Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Lord it's obvious we got a relationship. Talkin' to each other every night and day. Although you're superior over me. We talk to each other in a friendship way. Then outta nowhere you tell me to break. Outta the country and into more country. Past Dyesburg and Ripley. Where the ghost of childhood haunts me. Walk the roads my forefathers walked. Climb the trees my forefathers hung from. Ask those trees for all their wisdom. They tell me my ears are so young. (Home). Go back, from whence you came (Home). My family tree, my family name (Home). For some strange reason it had to be (Home). He guided me to Tennessee. (Home). (Home!) Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Now I see the importance of history. Why my people be in the mess that they be. Many journeys to freedom made in vain. By brothers on the corner playin' ghetto games. I ask you, Lord why you enlightened me. Without the enlightenment of all my folks. He said, cuz I set myself on a quest for truth. And he was there to quench my thirst. But I am still thirsty. The Lord allowed me to drink some more. He said what I am searching for are. The answers to all which are in front of me. The ultimate truth started to get blurry. For some strange reason it had to be. It was all a dream about Tennessee. (Home!) Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Take me to another place, take me to another land.. Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan.. Oh, won't you let me, won't you help me,. won't you help me understand your plan.. Take me home, take me home, home, take me to another place.. Take me home, take me home, home, take me to another place.Prince & The New Power Generation. Miscellaneous. Sexy M.F.. Yo man. What?.

Everybody that lives surely dies. A lot of people ask the questions why. Some people have to go through so much more. Before they really learn about life's score. The subject is not to be ignored (Kick it to ‘em, Joe). I don't wanna be the one. To tell you how it's gotta be. Livin' is the only way. You're ever really gonna see. You've got to live and learn. You've got to live and learn. Before your bridges burn. You've got to live and learn. Ah, yeah. Y'all, check it. Kick this one for the Public. Now break it down. There's so much wrong and negativity. Enough for the whole world to see. I know there's still a possibility. You raise a little kid, he turns out bold. It may be from the way you treat him cold. I guess that's how the story's told (Tell ‘em what it is). I don't wanna be the one. To tell you how it's gotta be. Livin' is the only way. You're ever really gonna see. You've got to live and learn. You've got to live and learn. Before your bridges burn. You've got to live and learn. You've got to live and learn. (I don't wanna be the one). You've got to live and learn. (To tell you how it's gotta be). Before your bridges burn. (Livin' is the only way). You've got to live and learn. (That you're ever gonna see). (Large) If large is how ya livin'. Why you're livin' large, are you takin' what is given. To you, in the form of true experience. ‘Cause if you're not your whole life could be spent. Doin' time for a crime you say you didn't even do. The only fool that you're foolin' is the fool that is you. Didn't even turn around to check and see if your bridge is burnin'. I guess it's true what they say that without livin' there's no learnin'. And this is from the J, the O, and the E. Mary, Mary, Mary, it's quite contrary. Yo', how did you earn your dough. You didn't finish school, you ain't got no job. But to the human eye it's pretty simple. You're always talkin' about what you want is respect. But never thinkin' about the little boy you neglect. Spendin' his formative years in a livin' hell. Not realizin' one day he'd end up in jail. Now on the other hand, there's Dan my man. Who planned a scam and I'll be damned. It was the ultimate flim flam. He was sayin' that it was easy as pie. But little did Dan know he was about to die. You've got to live and learn. (I don't wanna be the one). You've got to live and learn. (To tell you how it's gotta be). Before your bridges burn. (Livin' is the only way). You've got to live and learn. (That you're ever gonna see). You've got to live and learn. (I don't wanna be the one). You've got to live and learn. (To tell you how it's gotta be). Before your bridges burn. (Livin' is the only way). You've got to live and learn. (That you're ever gonna see). You've got to live and learn. (I don't wanna be the one). You've got to live and learn. (To tell you how it's gotta be)Babe I love you so. I want you to know. that I gonna miss your love. the minute you walk out that door.

Thank you, thank you, now check this out. (chorus)Not more than three short years ago. I was abandoned and alone. Without a penny to my name. So very young and so afraid. No proper shoes upon my feet. Sometimes I couldn't even eat. I often cried myself to sleep. But still I had to keep on going. Never knowing if I could take it. If I would make it through the night. I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed. And now I've found my way. If you believe in yourself enough. And know what you want. You're gonna make it happen. Make it happen. And if you get down on your knees at night. And pray to the Lord. He's gonna make it happen. Make it happen. You're gonna make it happen. Oh yeah. I know life can be so tough. And you feel like giving up. But you must be strong. Baby, just hold on. You'll never find the answers. If you throw your life away. I used to feel the way you do. Still I had to keep on going. Never knowing if I could take it. If I would make it through the night. I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed. And now I've finally found my way. If you believe in yourself enough. And know what you want. You're gonna make it happen. Make it happen, you're gonna make it happen. And if you get down on your knees at night. And pray to the Lord. He's gonna make it happen. Make it happen. If you believe in yourself enough. And know what you want. You're gonna make it happen. Make it happen, make it happen. And if you get down on your knees at night. And pray to the Lord. He's gonna make it happen. Make it happen, make it happen, yes. Make it, you're gonna make it. Make it, oh baby. I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed. And I've finally found my way. If you believe in yourself enough. And know what you want. You're gonna make it happen. Make it happen. And if you get down on your knees at night. And pray to the Lord. He's gonna make it happen. Make it happen, yes, He is. If you believe in yourself enough. And know what you want. You're gonna make it happen. Make it happen. And if you get down on your knees at night. And pray to the Lord. He's gonna make it happen. Make it happen. I once was lost but now I'm found. I got my feet on solid ground, thank you, Lord. If you believe within your soul. Just hold on tight and don't let go. You can make it, make it happen. Yeah, you can make it. Make it happen, gonna make it. Gonna make it, gonna make it. If you believe in yourself enough. And know what you want. You're gonna make it happen. Make it happen. And if you get down on your knees at night. And pray to the Lord. He's gonna make it happen.

I did not come to funk around. 'Til I get your daughter I won't leave this town. In the beginning God made the sea. But on the 7th day he made me. He was tryin' to rest y'all. When He heard the sound. Sound like a guitar, cold gettin' down. I tried to bust a high note. But I bust a string. My God was worried. 'Til he heard me sing. My name is Prince and I am funky. My name is Prince, the one and only. Hurt me. Do that, do that, somebody. Do that, do that, somebody. Do that, do that, somebody. Do that, do that, somebody. Do that, do that, somebody.

When you hear my music you'll be havin' fun. That's when I gottcha. That's when you mine. To tell the truth. Tell me what's my line?. My name is Prince and I am funky. My name is Prince, the one and only. Hurt me. Do that, do that, somebody. Do that, do that, somebody. Do that, do that, somebody. Do that, do that, somebody. My name is Prince, I don't wanna be king. 'Cause I've seen the top and it's just a dream. Big cars and women and fancy clothes. Will save your face but it won't save your soul. I'm here to tell you that there's a better way. Would our Lord be happy if He came today?. I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than you. But if you want to play with me, you better learn the rules. My name is Prince and I am funky. My name is Prince, the one and only. I did not come to funk around. 'Til I get your daughter I won't leave this town. I won't leave this town. I won't leave this town.

What is this you're seekin'?. The syncopated rhymes are at their peak. When you jumped on my D I C K. That's the one thing that I don't play. The jock strap was too big for you anyway. You're just a simpleton, I'll bust you like a pimple, son. My star is too bright. Boy, I'll sink you like the ship, Poseidon Adventure. You're bumpin' dentures to be cocksure. There must be more coming from your mouth than manure. So with a flow and a spray, I say. "Hey, you must become a prince before you're king anyway". Do that, do that somebody. Do that, do that somebody. It's time to get ig-ig-ignorant. Def be the beat that I'm rockin'. Yo so, come get a hit. And put your thinking cap on, you've been forewarned. I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin' in my cauldron. That means my nugget, sometimes I'm rugged. The style I posses be havin', the other brothers buggin'. And this is for those who oppose. To propose to overexpose disclose. Pose a threat to my brother. Like any other man makin' a stand. I'll be damned if I let you play this hand. I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked. What do you expect to win when you're used to playing craps?. Do that, do that somebody. Do that, do that somebody. It's gettin' tricky, I mean it's a sticky situation. To resurrect a groove with feeling and give it this much affection. Passion flows and who knows what lurks in the gallows of my mind. I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow. 12 inches of non-stop sole. I'm on a roll with P, it's time for the show. So do that, do that somebody. Wave your hands in the air. This is a motherfucking party. While you're laying back I'm on the attack paddywhack. Give yourself a bone. This is my house and I'm prone. To layin' some chrome upside some motherfuckers dome.

What is love?In the middle of the night. I go walking in my sleep. From the mountains of faith. To a river so deep. I must be looking for something. Something sacred I lost. But the river is wide. And it's too hard to cross. . And even though I know the river is wide. I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore. And try to cross to the opposite side. So I can finally find out what I've been looking for. . In the middle of the night. I go walking in my sleep. Through the valley of fear. To a river so deep. And I've been searching for something. Taken out of my soul. Something I would never lose. Something somebody stole. . I don't know why I go walking at night. But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore. I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life. Until I find what it is that I've been looking for. . In the middle of the night. I go walking in my sleep. Through the jungle of doubt. To a river so deep. I know I'm searching for something. Something so undefined. That it can only be seen. By the eyes of the blind. In the middle of the night. . I'm not sure about a life after this. God knows I've never been a spiritual man. Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river. That runs to the promised land. . In the middle of the night. I go walking in my sleep. Though the desert of truth. To the river so deep. We all end in the ocean. We all start in the streams. We're all carried along. By the river of dreams. In the middle of the nightOoh. Tu tu ru tu tu tu tu ooh, baby.   (Yea, baby). Tu tu ru tu tu tu tu ooh, baby.   (Oh yea). I need a lover to give me. The kind of love that will last always. I need somebody uplifting. To take me away, babe. Oh yea, yea. I want a lover who knows me, yea.   (Ooh, baby). Who understands how I feel inside. Someone to comfort and hold me. Through the long, lonely nights. Till the dawn. Why don't you take me away?. Dreamlover come rescue me.   (Baby). Take me up, take me down. Take me anywhere you want to baby now. I need you so desperately.   (Hmm). Won't you please, come around. 'Cause I wanna share forever with you baby.   (Tu tu ru tu tu tu tu tu, oooh). With you baby, hey. I don't want another pretender, na. To disillusion me one more time. Whisperin' words are forever. Playin' with my mind. No, no, no, no, no, no baby. I need someone to hold on to.   (Ooh, baby). The kind of love that won't fly away. I just want someone to belong to. Everyday. Of my life. Always. So come and take me away. Dreamlover come rescue me.   (Yea, ohh babe). Take me up take me down. Take me anywhere you want to baby now. I need you so desperately.   (I need you so desperately). Won't you please come around.

I need you so desperately.   (Come on baby). Won't you please, come around. 'Cause I wanna share forever with you babyCall you up in the middle of the night. Like a firefly without a light. You were there like a blow torch burning. I was a key that could use a little turning. So tired that I couldn't even sleep. So many secrets I couldn't keep. Promised myself I wouldn't weep. One more promise I couldn't keep. It seems no one can help me now. I'm in too deep. There's no way out. This time I have really led myself astray. Runaway train never going back. Wrong way on a one-way track. Seems like I should be getting somewhere. Somehow I'm neither here nor there. Can you help me remember how to smile. Make it somehow all seem worthwhile. How on earth did I get so jaded. Life's mystery seems so faded. I can go where no one else can go. I know what no one else knows. Here I am just drowning in the rain. With a ticket for a runaway train. And everything seems cut and dry. Day and night, earth and sky. Somehow I just don't believe it. Runaway train never going back. Wrong way on a one-way track. Seems like I should be getting somewhere. Somehow I'm neither here nor there. Bought a ticket for a runaway train. Like the madman laughing at the rain. Little out of touch, little insane. It's just easier than dealing with the pain. Runaway train never going back. Wrong way on a one-way track. Seems like I should be getting somewhere. Somehow I'm neither here nor there. Runaway train never coming back. Runaway train tearing up the track. Runaway train burning in my veins. I run away but it always seems the sameCame in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue. Thought I heard you talking softly. I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio. Still, I can't escape the ghost of you. What has happened to it all?. Crazy, some'd say. Where is the life that I recognize?. Gone away. But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say. "Pride will tear us both apart". Well, now, pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away. Left me in the vacuum of my heart. What is happening to me?. Crazy, some'd say. Where is my friend when I need you most?. Gone away. But, I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. (Just blown away...). Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed. Fear today, forgot tomorrow. Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need. Ours is just a little sorrowed talk. And I don't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world. Somehow I have to find. And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world. I will learn to survive. Every world, is my world (I will learn to survive). Any world, is my world (I will learn to survive). Any world, is my world. Every world is my worldYo, back up now an' give a brother room. The fuse is lit an' I'm about to go boom.

And you cast your fears aside. And you know you can survive. So when you feel like hope is gone. Look inside you and be strong. And you'll finally see the truth. That a hero lies in you.

To fall down at your doorI heard from a friend today, and she. Said you were in town. Suddenly the memorises came back to me in. My mind. . How can i be strong I've asked myself. Time and time I've said. That I'll never fall in love with you again. . A wounded heart you gave. My soul you took away. Good intentions you had many. I know you did. I come from a place that hurts. God knows how I've cried. And I never want to return. Never fall again. . Making love to you felt so good and. Oh so right. . How can i be strong I've asked myself. Time and time I've said. That I'll never fall in love with you again. . So here we are alone again. Didn't think I'd come to this. And I know it all began. With just a little kiss. I've come to close to happiness. To have it swept away. Don't think I can take the pain. No never fall again. . Kinda late in the game. And my heart is in your hands. Don't you stand there and then tell me. You love me. Then leave again. 'Cause I'm falling in love with you again. . Hold me, hold me. Don't ever let me go. Say it just one time. Say you love me. God knows I do love you. AgainThe Spin Doctors. Miscellaneous. Two Princes. Two Princes. Spin Doctors. {c:intro}. (D///Bm//D A/// G///).

Here we go, whoomp there it isMy child arrived just the other day, came to the world in the usual way. But there were planes to catch and bills to pay. He learned to walk while I was away. He was talkin' 'fore I knew it and as he grew he said. "I'm gonna be like you, dad, you know I'm gonna be like you". . And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon. Little boy blue and the man on the moon. When you comin' home? Son, I don't know when. We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then". . Well, my son turned ten just the other day. He said, "Thanks for the ball, dad come on, let's play. Could you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today, I got a lot to do". He said, 'That's okay", And he, he walked away. And he smiled and he said, "You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know I'm gonna be like him". . And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon. Little boy blue and the man on the moon. When you comin' home? Son, I don't know when. We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then. . Well, he came from college just the other day. So much like a man I just had to say. "I'm proud of you, could you sit for a while?". He shook his head and he said with a smile. "What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys. See you later, can I have them please?". . And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon. Little boy blue and the man on the moon. When you comin' home? Son, I don't know when. We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then. . I've long since retired, my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day, "I'd like to see you, if you don't mind". He said, "I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time. You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu. But it's sure nice talkin' to you, dad, it's been sure nice talkin' to you". . And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me. He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me. . And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon. Little boy blue and the man on the moon.

In a beautiful world. I wish I was special. You're so fucking special. But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?. I don't belong here. I don't care if it hurts. I want to have control. I want a perfect body. I want a perfect soul. I want you to notice. When I'm not around. You're so fucking special. I wish I was special. But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?. I don't belong here. She's running out the door. She's running. She run, run, run, run. Run. Whatever makes you happy. Whatever you want. You're so fucking special. I wish I was special. But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?. I don't belong here. I don't belong hereSaid I Loved You... But I Lied. You are the candle, love's the flame. A fire that burns through wind and rain. Shine your light on this heart of mine. Till the end of time. You came to me like the dawn through the night. Just shinin' like the sun. Out of my dreams and into my life. You are the one, you are the one. Said I loved you but I lied. 'Cause this is more than love I feel inside. Said I loved you but I was wrong. 'Cause love could never ever feel so strong. Said I loved you but I lied. With all my soul I've tried in vain. How can mere words my heart explain. This taste of heaven so deep so true. I've found in you. So many reasons in so many ways. My life has just begun. Need you forever, I need you to stay. You are the one, you are the one. Said I loved you but I lied. 'Cause this is more than love I feel inside. Said I loved you but I was wrong. 'Cause love could never ever feel so strong. Said I loved you but I lied. You came to me like the dawn through the night. Just shinin' like the sun. Out of my dreams and into my life. You are the one, you are the one. Said I loved you but I lied. 'Cause this is more than love I feel inside. Said I loved you but I was wrong. 'Cause love could never ever feel so strong. Said I loved you but I lied. Said I loved you. But this is more than love I feel inside. Said I loved you... But I liedGreen light, Seven Eleven. You stop in for a pack of cigarettes. You don't smoke, don't even want to. Hey now, check your change. Dressed up like a car crash. Your wheels are turnin' but you're upside down. You say when he hits you, you don't mind. Because when he hurts you, you feel alive. Oh, is that what it is?. Red lights, gray morning. You stumble out of a hole in the ground. A vampire or a victim, it depends on who's around. You used to stay in to watch the adverts. You could lip synch to the talk shows. And if you look, you look through me. And when you talk, you talk at me. And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing. If I could stay, then the night would give you up. Stay, and the day would keep its trust. Stay, and the night would be enough. Faraway, so close, up with the static and the radio. With satellite television. You can go anywhere, Miami, New Orleans. London, Belfast and Berlin. And, if you listen, I can't call. And, if you jump, you just might fall. And, if you shout, I'll only hear you. If I could stay, then the night would give you up. Stay, and the day would keep its trust. Stay with the demons you drowned, stay with the spirit I found. Stay, and the night would be enough. Three O'clock in the morning, it's quiet, there's no one around. Just the bang and the clatter. As an angel runs to ground, just the bang and the clatter. As an angel hits the groundDeeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter. I can't help falling in love. I fall deeper and deeper the further I go. Kisses sent from heaven above. They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know. When you know the notes to sing, you can sing 'most anything. That's what my mama told me. 'Round and 'round and 'round you go. When you find love, you'll always know. I let my father mold me. Daddy couldn't be all wrong.   (Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there). And my mama made me learn this song.   (You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you). That's why I can't help falling in love. I fall deeper and deeper the further I go. Kisses sent from heaven above. They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know, the deeper I go. "All is fair in love", she said,. Think with your heart, not with your head. That's what my mama told me. All the little things you do will end up coming back to you. I let my father mold me. Daddy couldn't be all wrong.   (Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there). And my mama made me learn this song.   (You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you). That's why I can't help falling in love. I fall deeper and deeper the further I go. Kisses sent from heaven above. They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know. I can't help falling in love. I fall deeper and deeper the further I go. Kisses sent from heaven above. They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know. Someone said that romance was dead. And I believed it instead of remembering what my mama told me. Let my father mold me, then you tried to hold me. You remind me of what they said. This feeling inside, I can't explain. But my love is alive and I'm never gonna hide it again. Daddy couldn't be all wrong.   (Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there). And my mama made me learn this song.   (You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you). That's why I can't help falling in love. I fall deeper and deeper the further I go. Kisses sent from heaven above. They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know. Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. Never gonna hide it again. Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter. Never gonna have to pretend. Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. Never gonna hide it again. Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter. Never gonna have to pretend. You got to just let your body move to the music. You got to just let your body go with the flow. Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love. I can't keep from falling in love with you. You know there's nothing better that I'd like to doAll I can say is that my life is pretty plain. I like watchin' the puddles gather rain. And all I can do is just pour some tea for two. And speak my point of view but it's not sane, it's not sane. I just want someone to say to me. I'll always be there when you wake. You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today. So stay with me and I'll have it made. And I don't understand why I sleep all day. And I start to complain that there's no rain. And all I can do is read a book to stay awake. And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape, escape, escape, escape. All I can say is that my life is pretty plain. You don't like my point of view. You think I'm insane. It's not sane, it's not sane. I just want someone to say to me. I'll always be there when you wake. You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today. So stay with me and I'll have it made. And I'll have it made, and I'll have it made, oh no, no.

Carry me. like you are my brother,. love me like a mother. Will you be there?. Weary. Tell me will you hold me?. When wrong, will you scold me?. When lost will you find me?. But they told me. a man should be faithful,. and walk when not able,. and fight till the end,. but I'm only human!. Everyone taking control of me,. seems that the world's. got a role for me. I'm so confused. will you show to me,. you be there for me,. and care enough to bear me!. (Hold me). (Lay your head lowly). (Softly then boldly) (Yeah!). (Carry me there) (I'm only human!). (Feed me) (Hold me!). (Love me and feed me). (Kiss me and free me). (I will feel blessed) (I'm only human!). (Carry). (Carry me boldly). (Lift me up slowly). (Carry me there) (I'm only human!).

(Softly then boldly). (Carry me there). (Need me). (Love me and feed me). (Kiss me and free me). (I will feel blessed)I don't know what it is that you've done to me. But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way. Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing. It's a feeling I want to stay. Cause my heart starts beating triple time. With thoughts of loving you on my mind. I can't figure out just what to do. When the cause and cure is you. I get so weak in the knees. I can hardly speak. I lose all control. And something takes over me. In a daze your love's so amazing. Its not a phase I want you to stay. With me by my side. I swallow my pride. Your love is so sweet. It knocks me right off of my feet. Can't explain why your lovin makes me weak. Time after time after time I tried to fight it. But your love is strong it keeps on holding on. Resistance is down when you're around cries fading. In my condition I don't want to be alone. Cause my heart starts beating triple time. With thoughts of loving you on my mind. I can't figure out just what to do. When the cause and cure is you. I get so weak in the knees. I can hardly speak. I lose all control. And something takes over me. In a daze your loves so amazing. Its not a phase I want you to stay. With me by my side. I swallow my pride. Your love is so sweet. It knocks me right off of my feet. Can't explain why your lovin makes me weak. I try hard to fight it. No way can I deny it. Your love's so sweet. Knocks me off my feet. I get so weak in the knees. I can hardly speak. I lose all control. And something takes over me. In a daze you loves so amazing. Its not a phase I want you to stay. With me by my side. I swallow my pride. Your love is so sweet. It knocks me right off of my feet. Can't explains why your lovin makes me weak. I get so weak. Blood starts racing through my veins. I get so weak-. Boy it's something I can't explain. I get so weak. Something bout the way you do. The things you do. It knocks me right off of my feet. I can't explain why your lovin makes me weak. I get so weak in the knees. I can hardly speak. I lose all control. And something takes over me. In a daze your loves so amazing. Its not a phase I want you to stay. With me by my side. I swallow my pride. Your love is so sweet. It knocks me right off of my feet. Can't explain. how your love it makes me weakYou'll remember me when the west wind moves. Upon the fields of barley. You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky. As we walk in fields of gold. So she took her love. For to gaze a while. Upon the fields of barley. In his arms she fell as her hair came down. Among the fields of gold. Will you stay with me?. Will you be my love?. Among the fields of barley. We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky. As we lie in fields of gold. See the west wind move like a lover so. Upon the fields of barley. Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth. Among the fields of gold. I never made promises lightly. And there have been some that I've broken. But I swear in the days still left. We'll walk in fields of gold. We'll walk in fields of gold. Many years have passed since those summer days. Among the fields of barley. See the children run as the sun goes down. Among the fields of gold. You'll remember me when the west wind moves. Upon the fields of barley. You can tell the sun in his jealous sky. When we walked in fields of gold. When we walked in fields of gold. When we walked in fields of goldWhatever it is I do, I try to think about you.. I have a love for you that nothing hides.. Whatever it is I do, I'm always thinking of you.. I hope you look at me through patient eyes.. I've become amused.. I've become blind.. I've become what I know not breathes.. You seem illiterate to all my emotions.. I stand corrected, how well you read.. You speak the truth, you speak the me.. You fell the love I have yet to find.. I know it's there, I know it's there.. But I let the sandcastles kill my mind.. Pathetic me, I long to be you.. They think I'm close but i stand so fat.. The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear.. I'm Mr. Love only 'cause they starve.. Oil and water, lust and sympathy.. I'll life and death my way through the sun.. Where originates all the pain that leaves.. My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you.. Well define my love and attitude.. Open up your mind and it will sing to you.. You can always tell.. But I know remorse so well.. I left reality early due to the lack of love... reason.. . [Chorus:]. Whatever I do, I try to think about you.. I seek the sympathy and I can't lie.. Whatever it is I do, I'm always thinking of you.. I hope you look at me through patient eyes.. . The channel, a professional liar.. How I long to contradict those vibes.. Joni help me, I think I'm falling.. It's not the love and I quest the why.. I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right.. But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong.. The fear of pity is always awake.. But infinite sympathy completely gone.. It's the windows, the doors, the passageway to the truth.. Oh my god, it echoes the mind.. In total recall as wild as the deuce.. It's so deceiving is the clouded heart.. So superficial is the open wound.. I caress the infinite light.. That even at night. Overshadows the moon and sings to you.. Well, define my love, that lives with you.. Even when I die, it will still sing to you.. You can always tell if remorse has done you well.... The misconstrued my answers due to the. Lack of love...reason.. . [Chorus]and the game of Life. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Andy Kaufman in the wrestling match. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Monopoly, Twenty One, checkers and chess.

There are always two sides to every story. Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town. Where death waits in the darkness. With a weapon to cut some stranger down. Sleeping with an empty bottle. He's a sad and an empty hearted man. All he needs is a job. And a little respect. So, he can get out while he can. We always need to hear both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. A neighborhood peace is shattered. It's the middle of the night. Young faces hide in the shadows. While they watch their mother and father fight. He says she's been unfaithful. She says her love for him has gone. And the brother shrugs to his sister and says. "Looks like it's just us from now on". We always need to hear both sides of the story. We need to hear both sides of the story. And the lights are all on. The world is watching now. People looking for truth. We must not fail them now. Be sure, before we close our eyes. Don't walk away from here. 'Til you hear both sides. No, no, no, no. Here we are all gathered. In what seems to be the center of the storm. Neighbors once friendly. Now stand each side of the line that has been drawn. They've been fighting here for years. But, now there's killing on the streets. While small coffins are lined up sadly. Now united in defeat. We always need to hear both sides of the story. And the lights are all on. The world is watching now. People looking for truth. We must not fail them now. Be sure, before we close our eyes. Don't walk away from here. 'Til you see both sides. No, no, no, no, no, no. White man turns the corner. Finds himself within a different world. Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder. Throws him up against the wall. He says, would you respect me. If I didn't have this gun. 'Cos without it, I don't get it. And that's why I carry one. We always need to hear both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Oh, both sides of the story. Yes, both sides of the story. Oh, both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Both sides, both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Both sides of the story, Yeah, yeah. Both sides of the story. Both sides, both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Both sides of the story. Must hear both sides of the storyCome on. Check it out, ya'll. Come on, come on!. Come on, come on!. Check it out! 'The tribal dance!'. (Say that again?). Feel the force, this is your chance.

And I know you've heard, I know it's real. Rain is what this thunder brings. For the first time I can hear my heart sing. Call me a fool but I know I'm not. I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top. Till I feel your. Rain, feel it on my finger tips. Hear it on my window pane. Your love's coming down like. Rain, wash away my sorrow. Take away my pain. Your love's coming down like rain. When you looked into my eyes. And you said, "Goodbye". Could you see my tears when I turned the other way. Did you hear me say. "I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky". You promised me when you said goodbye. That you'd return when the storm was done. And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun. Till I feel your. Rain, feel it on my finger tips. Hear it on my window pane. Your love's coming down like. Rain, wash away my sorrow. Take away my pain. Your love's coming down like. Here comes the sun. Here comes the sun. And I say, never go away. Waiting is the hardest thing.  (It's strange I feel like I've known you before). I tell myself that if I believe in you. In the dream of you.  (I want to understand you more and more and more). With all my heart and all my soul. (When I'm with you I feel like a magical child). That by sheer force of will, I will raise you from the ground. (Everything is strange). And without a sound you'll appear. (Everything is wild). And surrender to me, to love. Rain is what the thunder brings. For the first time I can hear my heart sing. Call me a fool but I know I'm not. I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top. Till I feel your. Rain, I feel it, it's coming. Your love's coming down like. Rain, I feel it, it's coming. Your love's coming down like. Rain, feel it on my finger tips. Hear it on my window pane. Your love's coming down like. Rain, wash away my sorrow. Take away my pain. Your love's coming down like. Rain, I feel it, it's coming. Your love's coming down like. Rain, I feel it, it's coming. Your love's coming down like rain. I'll stand out on the mountaintop. And wait for you to call my name. RainZhane. Pronounced Jah-Nay. Hey Mr. DJ. 1 - Everybody move your body . Now do it .

Didn't help me, I guess I'm all messed up, now baby. As soon as I jumped into my ride. Those memories start to play. A song comes on, on the radio. And there you are baby once again. It's just another sad love song. Rackin' my brain like crazy. Guess I'm all torn up. Be it fast or slow it doesn't let go. Or shake me and it's all because of you. Since you've been gone. I keep think about you, baby. Gets me all choked up. This heart of mine keeps. Dreamin' of you and it's crazy. You'd think I'd had enough, yeah. As soon as I get you out my head. I'm in your car again, ooh darlin'. Just one request from the radio. I'm back in love sugar once again. It's just another sad love song. Rackin' my brain like crazy. Guess I'm all torn up. Be it fast or slow, it doesn't let go. Or shake me, ooh baby. Here comes the strings then somebody sings. Only takes a beat and then it starts killin' me, darlin'. Only takes one note, I tell you from that radio. It's just another lonely love song. It's just another sad love song. Rackin' my brain like crazy. Guess I'm all torn up. Be it fast or slow, it doesn't let go. Or shake me and it's all because of you. It's a sad, it's a sad. It's a sad, sad love song. And it's all because of you. It's a sad, it's a sad. It's a sad, sad love songHere have a dollar. In fact now brotherman, here have two. Two dollars means a snack for me. But it means a big deal to you. Be strong, serve God only. Know that if you do, beautiful Heaven awaits. That's the poem I wrote for the first time. I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate. Mr. Wendal, that's his name. No one ever knew his name 'cuz he's a no one. Never thought twice about spending on an old bum. Until I had the chance to really get to know one. Now that I know 'em, to give him money isn't charity. He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes. And to think blacks spend all their money on big colleges. Still most of you come out confused. Go ahead Mr. Wendal. Go ahead Mr. Wendal. Mr. Wendal has freedom. A free that you and I think he's dumb. Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society. For Mr. Wendal's a bum. His only worries are sickness and occasional harassment. By the police and their chase. Uncivilized we call him but I just saw him. Eat off the food we waste. Civilization, are we really civilized?. Yes or no, who are we to judge. When thousands of innocent man could be brutally enslaved. And killed over a racist grudge. Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways. But we don't hear him talk. It's not his fault when we're goin' too far and we got too far. 'Cuz on him we walk. Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh but not by law. I feed you dignity to stand with pride. Realize now that all in all we stand tall. Go ahead Mr. Wendal. Mr. Wendal. Mr. Wendal. Mr. WendalI've heard people say that. Too much of anything. Is not good for you baby. But I don't know about that. As many times as we've loved. Shared love and made love. It doesn't seem to me. Like it's ever, ever enough. It's just not enough. My darling, I, can't get enough of your love babe. I don't know I don't know I don't know why. I can't get enough of your love babe. Oh some things I can't get used to. No matter how I try. It's like the more you give the more I want. And baby that's no lie, oh no babe. Tell me what can I say. What am I gonna do. How should I feel, when everything is you you you. What kind of love is this. That you've given me. Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet. All I know is every time you're near. I feel a change. Something's moving. I scream your name. What you got me doing. If I could make you see. And make you understand. Your love for me is all I need. and more than I can stand. Oh well babe. How can I explain. All the things I feel. You've given me so much. You're so unreal, unreal, unreal. Still I keep loving you. More and more each time. What am I gonna do. Cause you've blown my mind. I get the same old feeling. Every time you're near. I feel a change. Something's moving. I scream your name. What you got me doing. SONGWRITERS. WILLIAMS, JERRY LYNN. PUBLISHED BY. LYRICSBad boys, whatcha want.

Well, the first little piggy, well, he was kinda hick. He spent most of his days just a dreamin' of the city. And then one day, he bought a guitar. He moved to Hollywood to become a star. But living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city. Built his house out of straw, what a pity. And then one day, jammin' on some chords. Along came the wolf, knocking on his door. Little pig, little pig, let me in. Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin. Little pig, little pig, let me in. Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin. Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in. Huffin', puffin', blow your house in. Huffin', puffin', blow your house in. Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in. Well, the second little piggy, well, he was kinda stoked. He spent most of his day just in ganja smokin'. Huffin' and a puffin' down on Venice Beach. Getting paid money for religious speech. He built his shelter from what he garbage picked. Mostly made up of old cans and sticks. Then one day he was cranking out Bob Marley. And along came the wolf on his big, bad Harley. Little pig, little pig, let me in. Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin. Little pig, little pig, let me in. Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin. Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in. Huffin', puffin', blow your house in. Huffin', puffin', blow your house in. Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in. Well, the third little piggy, the grade A student. His daddy was a rock star named Pig Nugent. Earned his Masters Degree from Harvard College. Built his house from his architect knowledge. A tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills. Daddy's rock stardom, paid for the bills. And then one day came the old house smasher. The big, bad wolf, the little piggy slasher. Little pig, little pig, let me in. Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin. Little pig, little pig, let me in. Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin. Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in. Huffin', puffin', blow your house in. Huffin', puffin', blow your house in. Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in. Well, the big bad wolf. Well, he huffed and he puffed, all that he could. And low and behold the little piggy's house stood. "It's made out of concrete", the little piggy shouted. The wolf just frowned, as he pouted. So, they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would. They sent out Rambo just as fast as they could. Yo, wolf-face, I'm your worst nightmare. Your ass is mine. Well, the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see. So, that's to end the story for you and me. If you still give a listen, you just may. Hear a big wolf or little piggy say. Little pig, little pig, let me in. Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin. Little pig, little pig, let me in. Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin. Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in. Huffin', puffin', blow your house in. Huffin', puffin', blow your house in. Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in. And the moral of the story is. A band with no talent can easily amuse. Idiots with a stupid, puppet showDa-da-da-day, da-da-da-da-day-ay, Da-da-da-day, da-da-da-da-day-ay. Da-da-da-day, da-da-da-da-day-ay. If the shoe fits I want you to wear it,. and wear it good,. ah-ah, ah-ah-yeah, ah-ah-hah. Talkin' 'bout them times when I was by myself,. I would always be lookin' for somebody else. But as time went on I had a talk with my mind,. friends like you and you I gotta leave behind. And so, you call me your friend but you only want my gifts. And I'll never see you if I had no loot,. I'll never see them. I'm just glad I know the truth. and I'm payin' my own bills. and I'll never ever depend on you. Friends and enemies around me everyday,. I can't believe half the things they say. Takin' me for granted givin' no credit at all,. I'll just keep bouncin' like a bouncin' ball. Everybody seems to disappear on me,. can't trust no one as far as I can see. If I could be that fly that's on the wall, listenin' to my friends talk about it all. You call me your friend. but you only want my gifts. And I'll never see you if I had no loot,. I'll never see them. I'm just glad I know the truth. and I'm payin' my own bills. And I'll never ever depend on you,. Sons Of Soul, y'all. I don't mean to step on nobody's foot, but ah -. When I need somebody there's nobody to call. When they need me,. my phone rings off the wall. But these are my friends. and that so what they say. Constantly takin' from me everyday, you say. You call me your friend. but you only want my gifts. And I'll never see you if I had no loot,.

No barkin' from the dog, no smog. And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog. (Damn). I got my grub on, but didn't pig out. Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out. (Whassup?). Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'. Thinkin' will I live another twenty-fo'. I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top. . And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop. Had to stop, at a red light. Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight. And everything is alright. I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night. Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all. Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?. Get me on the court and I'm trouble. Last week fucked around and got a triple double. Freakin' niggaz everyway like M.J. I can't believe, today was a good day. (Shit!). . Drove to the pad and hit the showers. Didn't even get no static from the cowards. 'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me. Saw the police and they rolled right past me. No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction. As I ran the intersection. Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' yo! MTV Raps. What's the haps on the craps?. . Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em. Roll 'em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break 'em. With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven.

Left my nigga's house paid. (What). Picked up a girl been tryin' to fuck since the 12th grade. It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic. The lakers beat the Supersonics. I felt on the big fat fanny. Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny. And my dick runs deep, so deep. So deep put her ass to sleep. Woke her up around one. She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun. Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'. Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion. . I was glad everything had worked out. Dropped her ass off and then chirped out. Today was like one of those fly dreams. Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams. No helicopter looking for a murder. Two in the mornin' got the Fatburger. Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp. And it read, "Ice Cube's a pimp". (Yeah). Drunk as hell but no throwin' up. Half way home and my pager still blowin' up. Today I didn't even have to use my A.K. I got to say it was a good day. (Shit!). . Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh, stop this shit.

There's pigeons down on Market Square. She's standin' in her underwear. Lookin' down from a hotel room. Nightfall will be comin' soon. Oh, my, my, oh, hell, yes. You got to put on that party dress. It was too cold to cry, I woke up alone. I hit my last number, walked to the road. Last dance with Mary Jane. One more time to kill the pain. I feel summer creepin' in.

This is L.A.. "All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die". Says the man next to me out of nowhere. It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William. But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy. And he's plain ugly to me. And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life. We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday. In a bar that faces a giant car wash. The good people of the world. Are washing their cars on their lunch break. Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits. They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks. Back to the phone company, the record store too. Well they're nothing like Billy and me. 'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. Until the sun comes up. Over Santa Monica Boulevard. I like a good beer buzz early in the morning. And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud. He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match. In an oversized pack letting each one burn. Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out. And he's watching the bottles of Bud. As they spin on the floor. And a happy couple enters the bar. Dangerously close to one another. The bartender looks up from his want ads. But all I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. Until the sun comes up. Over Santa Monica Boulevard. Otherwise the bar is ours. The day and the night and the car wash, too. The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars. The sun and the moon. But all I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling, I'm not the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. I've got a feeling the party has just begun. All I wanna do is have some fun. I won't tell you, that you're the only one. All I wanna do is have some fun. Until the sun comes up. Over Santa Monica Boulevard. Until the sun comes up.

Beugouma kouma khol oaldine yaw li neka si yaw. Mo ne si man, li ne si mane moye dilene diapale. Roughneck and rudeness. We should be using. On the ones who practice wicked charms. For the sword and the stone. Bad to the bone. Battle is not over. Even when it's won. And when a child is born. Into this world. It has no concept. Of the tone the skin is livin' in. It's not a second. 7 seconds away. Just as long as I stay. I'll be waiting. It's not a second. 7 seconds away. Just as long as I stay. I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting. J'assume les raisons qui nous poussent de changer tout. J'aimerais qu'on oublie leur couleur pour qu'ils esperent. Beaucoup de sentiments de races qui font qu'ils desesperent. Je veux les portes grandements ouvertes. Des amis pour parler de leur peine, de leur joie. Pour qu'ils leur filent des infos qui ne divisent pas. Changer. 7 seconds away. Just as long as I stay. I'll be waiting. It's not a second. 7 seconds away. Just as long as I stay. I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting. And when a child is born. Into this world. It has no concept. Of the tone the skin is livin' in. And there's a million voices. And there's a million voices. To tell you what she should be thinkin'. So you better sober up for just a second. 7 seconds away. But just as long as I stay. I'll be waiting. It's not a second. 7 seconds away. Just as long as I stay. I'll be waiting. ...Things haven't been the same. Since you came into my life. You found a way to touch my soul. And I'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go. Happiness lies in your own hand. It took me much too long. To understand how it could be. Until you shared your secret with me. Something's comin' over. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over me. My baby's got a secret. You gave me back the paradise. That I thought I lost for good. You helped me find the reasons why. It took me by surprise that you understood. You knew all along. What I never wanted to say. Until I learned to love myself. I was never ever lovin' anybody else. Happiness lies in your own hand. It took me much too long. To understand how it could be. Until you shared your secret with me. Something's comin' over. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over me. My baby's got a secret. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over me. My baby's got a secret. Happiness lies in your own hand. It took me much too long. To understand how it could be. Until you shared your secret with me. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over me. My baby's got a secret. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over. Mmm, mmm, something's comin' over me. My baby's got a secret. Mmm, mmm, my baby's got a secret. Mmm, mmm, my baby's got a secret. Mmm, mmm, my baby's got a secret from me. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmmYou say, I only hear what I want to. And you say I talk so all the time, so. And I thought what I felt was simple. And I thought that I don't belong. And now that I am leaving. Now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you. Yeah, I missed you. And you say, I only hear what I want to. I don't listen hard. I don't pay attention to the distance. That you're running or to. Anyone, anywhere. I don't understand if you really care. I'm only hearing negative, no no no, bad. So I turned the radio on I turned the radio up. And this woman was singing my song. The lover's in love and the other's run away. The lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay. And some of us hover when we weep for the other who was dying. Since the day they were born well. Well this is not that. I think that I'm throwing but I'm thrown. And I thought I'd live forever. But now I'm not so sure. You try to tell me that I'm clever. But that won't take me anyhow or anywhere with you. And you said that I was naive. And I thought that I was strong. I thought, "Hey I can leave, I can leave". But now I know that I was wrong 'cause I missed you. Yeah' I missed you. You said, you caught me 'cause you want me. And one day I'll let you go. You try to give away a keeper or keep me. 'Cause you're know you're just too scared to lose. And you say, "Stay". You say, I only hear what I want toMadonna. Something To Remember. I'll Remember. Mmmm, mmmm. Say good-bye to not knowing when. The truth in my whole life began. Say good-bye to not knowing how to cry. You taught me that. . Chorus (first time substitute "strength" for "love" and "saved" for "changed"): . . And I'll remember the love that you gave me. Now that I'm standing on my own. I'll remember the way that you changed me. I'll remember. . Inside I was a child. That could not mend a broken wing. Outside I looked for a way. To teach my heart to sing. . (chorus). . I learned to let go of the illusion that we can possess. I learned to let go, I travel in stillness. And I'll remember happiness. I'll remember [I'll remember]. Mmmmm... [I'll remember]. Mmmmm.... . (chorus). [I'll remember]. . No I've never been afraid to cry. Now I finally have a reason why. I'll remember [I'll remember]. (repeat 3 times, substituting "And" for "Now" the second and third times)My love. There's only you in my life. The only thing that's right. Oh yeah. My first love (yeah). You're every breath that I take. You're every step I make. (Oh). And I (And I). I want to share. All my love with you, hey yeah. No one else will do. And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes). They tell me how much you care. Oh, yes. You will always be. My endless love. Oh yeah. Two hearts. Two hearts that beat as one. Our lives have just begun. And forever (forever). I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. No no no no (no no no). And I. (And I). I'd be a fool. For you, I'm sure. You know I don't mind (no, you know I don't mind). 'Cause baby you (baby, baby, baby, baby). You mean the world to me, yeah. I know I've found in you. My endless love. Yeah (yeah). Do do, do dooo, do do do. Whoa. And I. I'd play the fool. For you, (for you baby) I'm sure. That you know I don't mind (you know I don't mind). Oh, yes. You'd be the only one. 'Cause no-one can't deny. This love I have inside. And I'll give it all to you. My love (my love, my love). My my my. My endless love. My loveAnother head hangs lowly. Child is slowly taken. And the violence caused such silence. Who are we mistaken?. But you see, it's not me, it's not my family. In your head, in your head they are fighting. With their tanks and their bombs. And their bombs and their guns. In your head, in your head, they are crying. In your head, in your head. Zombie, zombie, zombie. Hey, hey, hey, what's in your head, in your head?. Zombie, zombie, zombie. Hey, hey, hey, hey. oh, oh, dou, dou, dou, dou. dou, dou, dou, dou. dou, dou, dou, dou. dou, dou, dou, dou. Another mother's breakin'. Heart is taking over. When the violence causes silence. We must be mistaken. It's the same old theme since nineteen-sixteen. In your head, in your head they're still fighting. With their tanks and their bombs. And their bombs and their guns. In your head, in your head, they are dying. In your head, in your head. Zombie, zombie, zombie. Hey, hey, hey, what's in your head, in your head. Zombie, zombie, zombie?. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Hey, oh, ya, ya yaIf I never feel you in my arms again. If I never feel your tender kiss again. If I never hear I love you now and then. Will I never make love to you once again. Please, understand if love ends. Then I promise you, I promise you. That, that I shall never breathe again.   (Breathe again, breathe again). That I shall never breathe again.   (Breathe again, yeah). And I can't stop thinkin' about. About the way things used to be. And I can't stop thinkin' about. About the love that you make to me. And I can't get you out of my head. How in the world will I begin. To let you walk right out my life. And blow my heart away?. And I can't stop carin' about. About the apple of my eye. And I can't stop doin' without. Without the center of my life. And I can't get you out of my head. And I know I can't pretend. That I won't die if you decide. You won't see me again. If I never feel you in my arms again. If I never feel your tender kiss again. If I never hear I love you now and then. Will I never make love to you once again. Please, understand if love ends. Then I promise you, I promise you. That, that I shall never breathe again.   (Breathe again, breathe again). That I shall never breathe again.   (Breathe again, yeah). And I can't stop thinkin' about. About the way my life would be. No I can't stop thinkin' about. How could you love me then leave. And I can't get you out of my mind. God knows how hard I tried. And if you walk right out my life. God knows I'd surely die. And I can't stop doin' without. Without the rhythm of my heart. No, I can't stop doin' without. For I would surely fall apart. And I can't get you out of my mind. 'Cause I know I can't deny. And I would die if you decide. You won't see me again. If I never feel you in my arms again. If I never feel your tender kiss again. If I never hear I love you now and then. Will I never make love to you once again. Please understand if love ends. Then I promise you, I promise you. That, that I shall never breathe again.   (Breathe again, breathe again). No, no, no, that I shall never breathe againDarlin' I can't explain. Where did we lose our way. Girl it's drivin' me insane. And I know I just need one more chance. To prove my love to you. If you come back to me. I'll guarantee. That I'll never let you go. Can we go back to the days our love was strong. Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong. Can somebody tell me how to get things back. The way they used to be. Oh God give me a reason. I'm down on bended knee. I'll never walk again until you come back to me. I'm down on bended knee. So many nights I dreamt. Holding my pillow tight. I know that I don't need to be alone. When I open up my eyes. To face reality. Every moment without you. It seems like eternity. I'm begging you, begging you come back to me. Can we go back to the days our love was strong. Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong. Can somebody tell me how to get things back. The way they used to be. Oh God give me a reason. I'm down on bended knee. I'll never walk again until you come back to me. I'm down on bended knee. I'm gonna swallow my pride. Say I'm sorry. Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me. I want a new life. And I want it with you. If you feel the same. Don't ever let it go. You gotta believe in the spirit of love. It'll heal all things. It won't hurt any more. No I don't believe our love's terminal. I'm down on my knees begging you please. Come home. Can we go back to the days our love was strong. Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong. Can somebody tell me how to get things back. The way they used to be. Oh God give me a reason. I'm down on bended knee. I'll never walk again until you come back to me. I'm down on bended knee. Wanna build a new life. Just you and me. Gonna make you my wife. Raise a familyIn the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey. Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie. With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables. Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose. Kill the headlights and put it in neutral. Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control. Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D. Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat. Someone keeps saying, I'm insane to complain. About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt. Don't believe everything that you breathe. You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve. So shave your face with some mace in the dark. Saving all your food stamps. And burning' down the trailer park. Yo, cut it. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare. Banned all the music with a phony gas chamber. 'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag. One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag. With the re-run shows and the cocaine nose job. The daytime crap of the folksinger slop. He hung himself with a guitar string. I slap the turkey neck and it's hanging' from a pigeon wing. You can't write if you can't relate. Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate. And my time is a piece of wax, falling on a termite. Who's choking on the splinters. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. Soy, soy, soy. I'm a driver, I'm the winner. Things are gonna change, I can feel it. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?. Soy un perdedor. I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?I was down at the New Amsterdam. Staring at this yellow-haired girl. Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation. With a black-haired flamenco dancer. . You know, she dances while his father plays guitar. She's suddenly beautiful. We all want something beautiful. Man, I wish I was beautiful. . So come dance this silence down through the morning. Cut up, Maria, show me some of them Spanish dances. And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones. Believe in me, help me believe in anything. . 'Cause I want to be someone who believes, yeah. Mr. Jones, and me tell each other fairy tales. And we stare at the beautiful women. "She's looking at you, ah, no, no, she's looking at me". . Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo. When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely. Well, I will paint my picture. Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray. . All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful. Yeah well, you know, gray is my favorite color. I felt so symbolic yesterday, if I knew Picasso. I would buy myself a gray guitar and play. . Mr. Jones and me look into the future. Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women. "She's looking at you, I don't think so. She's looking at me". . Standing in the spotlight. I bought myself a gray guitar. When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely. I will never be lonely, said I'm never gonna be lonely. . I want to be a lion, everybody wants to pass as cats. We all want to be big, big stars. Yeah, but we got different reasons for that. Believe in me 'cause I don't believe in anything. . And I want to be someone to believe, to believe, to believe, yeah. Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio. Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women. "She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me". . I want to be Bob Dylan. Mr. Jones wishes he was someone, just a little more funky. When everybody loves you, son. That's just about as funky as you can be. . Mr. Jones and me staring at the video. When I look at the television. I want to see me staring right back at me. We all want to be big stars. . But we don't know why and we don't know how. But when everybody loves me. I wanna be just about as happy as I can be. Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big starsRegulators. we regulate any stealing of his property. and we damn good too.

Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold. now they droppin and yellin. it's a tad bit late. Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate. I laid all them busters down. I let my gat explode. now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode. if you want skirts sit back and observe. I just left a gang of those over there on the curb. Now Nate got the freaks. and that's a known fact. before I got jacked I was on the same track. back up back up cause it's on. N A T E and me. the Warren to the G.

Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins. There were times in my life. When I was goin' insane. Tryin to walk through. The pain. When I lost my grip. And I hit the floor. Yeah, I thought I could leave, but couldn't get out the door. I was so sick and tired. Of livin' a lie. I was wishin that I. Would die. . chorus. . It's Amazing.

And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight. . That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation. And how high can you fly with broken wings?. Life's a journey not a destination. And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings. . You have to learn to crawl. Before you learn to walk. But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk. I was out on the street. Just tryin' to survive. Scratchin' to stay. Alive. . chorusFrom the day we arrive on the planet. And blinking, step into the sun. There's more to be seen than can ever be seen. More to do than can ever be done. Some say eat or be eaten. Some say live and let live. But all are agreed as they join the stampede. You should never take more than you give. In the circle of life. It's the wheel of fortune. It's the leap of faith. It's the band of hope. Till we find our place. On the path unwinding. In the circle, the circle of life. Some of us fall by the wayside. And some of us soar to the stars. And some of us sail through our troubles. And some have to live with the scars. There's far too much to take in here. More to find than can ever be found. But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky. Keeps great and small on the endless round. In the circle of life. It's the wheel of fortune. It's the leap of faith. It's the band of hope. Till we find our place. On the path unwinding. In the circle, the circle of life. It's the wheel of fortune. It's the leap of faith. It's the band of hope. Till we find our place. On the path unwinding. In the circle, the circle of life. On the path unwinding. In the circle, the circle of lifeI like to move it, move it. I like to move it, move it. I like to move it, move it.

You'd better come on. The moon is alright. The freeway's heading south. My heart is going boom. There's a strange taste in my mouth. Baby, babe. I'm moving real fast. So try to hold on. Try to hold on. Sleeping in my car. I will undress you. Sleeping in my car. I will caress you. Staying in the back seat. Of my car making up. So come out tonight. I'll take you for a ride.

The night is so pretty and so youngBabe, I'm here again. Babe, where have you been?. Babe, I'm back again. I come to your door to see you again. But where you once stood was an old man instead. I asked where you'd be, he said, "She's moved on, you see. All I have is a number you'd better ask her not me". So I picked up the phone and dialed your number. Not sure to put it down or speak. Then I voice I once knew answered in a sweet voice. She said, "Hello" Then paused before I began to speak. Babe, I'm here again, I tell you I'm here again. Where have you been?. Babe, I'm back again, I tell you I'm back again. Where have you been?. You held your voice well, there were tears I could tell. Where were you now? Was you gonna tell me in time?. Just give me a town and I'll be straight down. I've got so much to tell you about where I have been. As I walk down your road, can't wait to be near you. I can't keep this feeling in inside. As I stand at your door you answered in a sweet voice. You said, "Hello" Then pause before I begin to speak. Babe, I'm here again, I tell you I'm here again. Where have you been?. Babe, I'm back again, I tell you I'm back again. Where have you been?. As I looked away, I saw a face behind you. A little boy stood at your door. And when I looked again I saw his face was shining. He had my eyes, he had my smile. Babe, I'm back again, I tell you I'm back again. I'm here for you. Babe, please take me back, please take me back. Back home again. Babe, please hold me close, hold me close. Like you used to do. Babe, just feel me, feel meTake the chance . Give it all that you can . Cause he doesn't feel a thing for you . You can try to move on . So nothing will go wrong . Maybe he will be back . To search for you . . Back on track . It's me yeah, and I fixed it . I proved my point, now we mix it . Yeah the A double L star, fresh and I got together . To make the track flow better . That's why we stand strong, now you know what's up . If I'm on the move, . I can't stop . The beat is simple, but you can't refuse it, . That's why I love music. . . Move on baby . Move on baby . Move on baby . And we get together . . Again and again I keep going with the swing . I stay funky like this and I bring . Beats to move you, . So I can prove you . That I can rock a microphone like I used to . I love music yeah, can you feel it . Check me out . This is how I deal it . The bass, the mid, the treble . I just fuse it together . Cause I love music.In my eyes, indisposed. In disguise as no one knows. Hides the face, lies the snake. The sun in my disgrace. . Boiling heat, summer stench. 'Neath the black, the sky looks dead. Call my name through the cream. And I'll hear you scream again. . Black hole sun, won't you come?. And wash away the rain. Black hole sun, won't you come?. Won't you come?. . Stuttering, cold and damp. Steal the warm wind, tired friend. Times are gone for honest men. And sometimes far too long for snakes. . In my shoes, a walking sleep. And my youth, I pray to keep. Heaven send Hell away. No one sings like you anymore. . Hang my head, drown my fear. Till you all just disappear. . Black hole sun, won't you come?. And wash away the rain. Black hole sun, won't you come?. Won't you come?. . Black hole sun, won't you come?. And wash away the rain. Black hole sun, won't you come?. Won't you come?. . Black hole sun, won't you come?. And wash away the rain. Black hole sun, won't you come?. Won't you come?. ...Rainy night, I'm all alone. Sittin' here waitin' for your voice on the phone. Fever turns to cold, cold sweat. Thinkin' about the things we ain't done yet. Tell me now, I've got to know do you feel the same?. Do you just light up at the mention of my name?. Don't worry, baby, ain't nothin' new. That's just love sneakin' up on you. If your whole world's shakin', baby, feel like I do. That's just love sneakin' up on you. Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide. Once love comes sneakin' up on your blindside. And might as well try to stop the rain. Stand in the tracks of a runaway train. Just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be. Come on let's finish what you started with me. Don't worry, baby, ain't nothin' new. That's just love sneakin' up on you. If your whole world's shakin', baby, feel like I do. That's just love sneakin' up on you. Don't worry, baby, ain't nothin' new. That's just love sneakin' up on you. Whole world's shakin', feel like I do. That's just love sneakin' up on you. ...Yo.yo.you're no good to me..

Oh baby, babySwing low in the dark glass hour. You turn and cower see it turn to dust. Move on the stoned dark night. We take to flight. Snowfall turns to rust. Seems an infusion mine like a nursing rhyme. Fat man starts to fall. Here in a hostile place I hear your face starts to call. And if you think that I've been losing my way. That's because I'm slightly blinded. And if you think that I don't make too much sense. That's because I'm broken minded. Don't keep it. If you believe it. Don't keep it all inside (no, no).. Strong words in a Ganges sky I have to lie. Shadows move in pairs. Ring out from a blue sports car in the shooting yard. Looking through the tears. Out of the black slate time we move in line. But never reach an end. Falling along straight town as the ice comes down. River starts to bend. And if you think that I've been losing my way. That's because I'm slightly blinded. And if you think that I don't make too much sense. That's because I'm broken minded. Don't keep it. If you believe it. Don't keep it all inside (no, no).. Don't keep it. If you believe it. Don't keep it all inside (no, no).. Don't keep it. If you believe it. Don't keep it all inside (no, no).This song's dedicated to my homies. In that gangsta lean. Why'd you have to go so soon. It seems like yesterday. We were hanging round the hood. Now I'm gonna keep your memories alive. Like a homie should. A life time of memories. Going down the drain. I'd like to keep stepping. But I can't get past the pain. I tip my forty to your memory. Take a drink and I start to think. And I, I know one day soon we'll be. We'll be hanging out. This is for my homies. (This is for my homies, well, well). See you when I get there. In that gangsta lean. In that gangsta lean. This is for my homies. (This is for my homies, well). See you when I get there. In that gangsta lean. In that gangsta lean. My God, my God. Would you pass on a message for me. Ha, tell him, put down those. Dice for a second, Lord. Listen to his homie. Could you tell him. I'll never let go of his memory. So his son will know. You don't have to cry no more. Cause God's got his back. I said God's got his back. A lifetime of memories. (Lifetime of memories). Going down the drain. (Going down the drain). I'd like to keep stepping. (I would, oh, no). But I can't get past the pain. I tip my forty to your memory. Take a drink and I start to think.

Tommy from Master's Touch. My boy, EB and my boy, Ebeer. And whoever else out there that. Got a homie that's in a gangsta lean. And also, my boys in the pen. That ain't never gonna see the street again. Cause you know what. It don't matter what they was. Doing while they was here. They coulda been banging, slanging. But they ain't here no more. Now somebody's dead. Somebody's baby. That's somebody's homie. So go on and let em rest in peace. While they in that gansta lean. You know what I'm saying. That's on the real low.

You're living your life in peace and in harmony. You making your own decisions. That's how it's got to be for you and me. So many people are running around and 'round. Without any sense of logic. I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger. (Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing). Woah, you'll be living in danger.   (You can do what you want, you can live in a dream). I see lies in the eyes of a stranger. (Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing). Woah, you'll be living in danger.   (You can do what you want, you can live in a dream). I see lies in the eyes of a stranger. Woah, you'll be living in danger. People are the same today as they used to be. The same expectations. So high no one can reach that high. Not I nor you get satisfied today. We'll never get enough. I see lies, in the eyes of a stranger. (Live for yourself it's a wonderful thing). Woah, you'll be living in danger.

But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start. You want to shut out the night you want to shut down the sun. You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart. Think of how we'd lay down together. Who we'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong. Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the Gods. Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs. I treasure your love, I never want to lose it. You've been through the fires of hell. And I know you've got the ashes to prove it. I treasure your love, I want to show you how to use it. You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt. And I know you've got the scars to prove it. Remember everything that I told you. Well I'm telling you again that it's true. When you're alone and afraid and you're completely amazed. To find there's nothing anybody can do. Keep on believing and you'll discover baby. There's always something magic, there's always something new. And when you really, really need it the most. That's when rock 'n roll dreams come through. The beat is yours forever, the beat is always true. And when you really, really need it the most. That's when rock 'n roll dreams come through, for you. Once upon a time was a back beat. Once upon a time all the chords came to life. And the angels had guitars even before they had wings. If you hold on to a chorus you can get through the night. I treasure your love, I never want to lose it. You've been through the fires of hell. And I know you've got the ashes to prove it. I treasure your love, I want to show you how to use it. You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt. And I know you've got the scars to prove it. Remember everything that I told you. Well I'm telling you again that it's true. You're never alone 'cause you can put on the phones. And let the drummer tell your heart what to do. Keep on believing and you'll discover baby. There's always something magic, there's always something new. And when you really, really need it the most. That's when rock 'n roll dreams come through. The beat is yours forever, the beat is always true. And when you really, really need it the most. That's when rock 'n roll dreams come through, for you. Yeah. The beat is yours forever. That's when rock 'n roll dreams come through. ...As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.

And I know eventually we'll be together. One sweet day. Picture a little scene from Heaven. Darling, I never showed you. Assumed you'd always be there. I took your presence for granted.

Staring at a son that she just can't touch.. If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side. But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.. But all the praying just ain't helping at all. 'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.. So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how. Another body laying cold in the gutter.. Listen to me.. Don't go chasing waterfalls.. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all. But I think you're moving too fast.. Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation. But he just can't see.. She give him loving that his body can't handle. But all he can say is, "Baby, it's good to me.". One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror. But he doesn't recognize his own face.. His health is fading and he doesn't know why.. Three letters took him to his final resting place.. Y'all don't hear me.. Don't go chasing waterfalls.. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all. But I think you're moving too fast.. Don't go chasing waterfalls.. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all. But I think you're moving too fast.. I seen rainbow yesterday. But too many storms have come and gone. Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray. Is it because my life is ten shades of gray. I pray all ten fade away. Seldom praise Him for the sunny days. And like his promise is true. Only my faith can undo. The many chances I blew. To bring my life to anew. Clear blue and unconditional skies. Have dried the tears from my eyes. No more lonely cries. My only bleedin' hope. Is for the folk who can't cope. Wit such an endurin' pain. That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain. Who's to blame. For tootin' caine in your own vein. What a shame. You shoot and aim for someone else's brain. You claim the insane. And name this day in time. For fallin prey to crime. I say the system got you victim to your own mind. Dreams are hopeless aspirations. In hopes of comin' true. Believe in yourself. The rest is up to me and you. Don't go chasing waterfalls.. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all. But I think you're moving too fast.. Don't go chasing waterfalls.. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all. But I think you're moving too fast.Oh, when you walk by every night. Talking sweet and looking fine. I get kinda hectic inside. Mmm, baby I'm so into you. Darling, if you only knew. All the things that flow through my mind. But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby. When I close my eyes. You come and you take me. It's so deep in my daydreams. But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby. Images of rapture. Creep into me slowly. As you're going to my head. And my heart beats faster. When you take me over. Time and time and time again. But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby. When I close my eyes. You come and you take me. It's so deep in my daydreams. But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby. Sweet sweet fantasy baby.

Sweet sweet fantasy baby. Sweet sweet fantasy babyAnother day has gone, I'm still all alone. How could this be? You're not here with me. You never said good-bye, someone tell me why. Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?. Everyday I sit and ask myself. How did love slip away?. Something whispers in my ear and says. That you are not alone. I am here with you. Though you're far away. I am here to stay. You are not alone. I am here with you. Though we're far apart. You're always in my heart. You are not alone. All alone, why, oh....

Ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da. There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea. You became the light on the dark side of me. Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill. But did you know that when it snows. My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?. Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray. Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah. And now that your rose is in bloom. A light hits the gloom on the gray. Ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da.

Has a life, has a spirit, has a name. You think the only people who are people. Are the people who look and think like you. But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger. You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew. Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon. Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?. Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?. Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?. Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?. Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest.

Without love I wouldn't believe. In anything that lives and breathes. Without love I'd have no anger. I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here. Without love I wouldn't believe. I couldn't believe in you. And I wouldn't believe in me. Without love. I believe in love. I believe in love. I believe in love(So the story begins). City dweller. Successful fella.

They take their lives, destroy their goals. Their basic pride and dignity. Is stripped and torn and shown no pity. When this should be heaven for everyone. This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone. This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone etc.. And this is the end of this section.I was like peace in a groove. On a Sunday afternoon. You were there so was I. In the park 4th of July. I was chillin' with my kool aid. When Miss Chilli came to rely. That you had a thang for me. Finest thang you'd ever seen. I must admit to you. I've heard those lines a time or two. Although for some apparent reason. Monkey lines are now in season. Lights off, lights on. I guess the groove is on so I. (). Diggin' the scene. Diggin' on you. Diggin' on me. Baby baby ooo baby baby. It's on like that. It's on like that. I gotta be in love or somethin' like that. Diggin' the scene. Diggin' on you. Diggin' on me. Baby baby ooo baby baby. It's on like that. It's on like that. I gotta be in love or somethin' like that. I was like deep in a cool. What'nt gone be nobody's fool. Could not care less who was there. Could've been like anywhere. I was chillin' with my kool aid. Did not want to participate. In no silly conversations. Had no time for new relation ships. I must admit to you. When I heard the lines you threw. Although it usually turns me off. But this time you have turned me on. Lights off, lights on. I guess the groove is on and I am. Diggin' the scene. Diggin' on you. Diggin' on me. Baby baby ooo baby baby. It's on like that. It's on like that. I gotta be in love or somethin' like that. Diggin' the scene. Diggin' on you. Diggin' on me. Baby baby ooo baby baby. It's on like that. It's on like that. I gotta be in love or somethin' like that. Oh why do I feel the way I do. When all I can think about is you. What was it in a line. That made me fall for you. Do you know. Why I'm diggin' diggin' diggin' diggin' on you. Diggin' the scene. It's on like that. Diggin' diggin' diggin' diggin' on you. Diggin' the scene. Diggin' on you. Diggin' on me.

Diggin' on me. Baby baby ooo baby baby. It's on like that. It's on like that. I gotta be in love or somethin' like thatOoh yeah. Yahoo hoo. I don't wanna rain on this parade. But I'm starting to question the love that was made. I'm not looking for just an affair. Wanna love that is based on truth not just dare. You'll not hurt my pride if right now you decide. That you are not ready to settle down. But if you want my heart then it's time that you start. To act like you're mine in the light and the dark. If you love me say it. If you trust me do it. If you want me show it. If you need me prove it. If you love me say it. If you trust me do it. If you want me show it. If you need me prove it. You see now actions speak louder than words. So don't just say things that I've already heard. Don't want your body without your soul. I don't want a love who will come here and go. You'll not hurt my pride if right now you decide. That you are not ready to settle down. But if you want my heart then it's time that you start. To act like you're mine in the light and the dark. If you love me say it. If you trust me do it. If you want me show it. If you need me prove it. If you love me say it. If you trust me do it. If you want me show it. Prove it. If you love me say it. Do it. Show it. Prove it. Say it. Do it. Show it. Prove it. Oh I, oh I, I wanna touch you baby. And spread my love all around you, honey. And if you come, you gotta show, baby. True love to share. Show it. Prove it. Say it. Do it. Show it.

Now just like in a song from days of yore. Here you come a knockin', knockin' on my door. And I've never met a girl like you before. You give me just a taste so I want more and more. Now my hands are bleeding and my needs are raw. Now you've got me crawlin', crawlin' on the floor. And I've never met a girl like you before. You've made me acknowledge the devil in me. I hope to God I'm talkin' metaphorically. Hope that I'm talkin' allegorically. Know that I'm talkin' about the way I feel. And I've never met a girl like you before. Never, never, never, never, never met a girl like you before. This old town's changed so much, don't feel like I belong. Too many protest singers, not enough protest songs. And now you've come along, yes, you've come along. And I've never met a girl like you beforeYou are appreciated.. When I was young me and my mama had beef. 17 years old kicked out on the streets. Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face. Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place. Suspended from school, scared to go home. I was a fool with the big boys, breakin' all the rules. Shed tears with my baby sister. Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids. And even though we had different daddies. The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama. I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell. Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell. And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary. One day, runnin' from the police that's right. Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside. And even as a crack fiend mama. You always was a black queen mama. I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man. You always was committed, a poor single mother on welfare. Tell me how you did it, there's no way I can pay you back. But the plan is to show you that I understand.. You are appreciated.. Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama). Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated). Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.. Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair. No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there. He passed away and I didn't cry. 'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger. They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless. But all along I was lookin' for a father, he was gone. I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs. They showed a young brother love. I moved out and started really hangin'. I needed money of my own so I started slangin'. I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks. It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox. I love payin' rent when the rent's due. I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you. 'Cause when I was low you was there for me. You never left me alone because you cared for me. And I can see you comin' home after work, late. Your in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate. Just workin' with the scraps you was given. And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving. But now the road got rough, your alone. Tryin' to raise 2 bad kids on your own. And there's no way I can pay you back. But my plan is to show you that I understand.. You are appreciated.. Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (And dear Mama). Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated). Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.. Pour out some liquor and I reminisce. 'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama. And when it seems that I'm hopeless. You say the words that can get me back in focus. When I was sick as a little kid. To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did. And all my childhood memories. Are full of all the sweet things you did for me. And even though I act crazy. I got to thank the Lord that you made me. There are no words that can express how I feel. You never kept a secret, always stayed real. And I appreciate how you raised me. And all the extra love that you gave me. I wish I could take the pain away. If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day. Everything will be alright if you hold on. It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on. And there's no way I can pay you back. But my plan is to show you that I understand.. You are appreciated.. Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama). Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated). Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama). Sweet lady, lady, lady, lady.It's just one of dem days, when I wanna be all alone. It's just one of dem days, when I gotta be all alone.

Only wanna be with youWe've come so far and we've reached so high. And we've looked each day and night in the eye. And we're still so young and we hope for more. We've come a long way. But we're not too sure where we've been. We've had success, we've had good times. But remember this. Been on this path of life for so long. Feel I've walked a thousand miles. Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love. Everybody's been there. With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope. And I knew I could make it. Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw. My face in the moonlight. Just then I realized what a fool I could be. Just 'cause I look so high you don't have to see me. Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still. There's a road going down the other side of this hill. Never forget where you're coming from. Never pretend that it's all real. Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream. This will be someone else's dream. Safe from the arms of dissapoitment for so long. Feel each day we've come too far. Yet each day seems to make much more. Sure is good to be here. I understand the meaning of 'I can't explain this feeling' now. And it feels so unreal. At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I made. The fact of reality. Never forget where you're coming from. Never pretend that it's all real. Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream. This will be someone else's dream. We've come so far and we've reached so high. And we've looked each day and night in the eye. And we're still so young and we hope for more. But remember this. We're not invincible, we're not invicible, no. We're only people, we're only people. Hey we're not invincible, we're not invicible. So again I tell you. Never forget where you're coming from. Never pretend that it's all real. Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream. This will be someone else's dream. Never, never forget where. Never pretend that it's all real. Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream. This will be someone else's dream. Never, everybody sing, oh baby.

And if you complain once more. You'll meet an army of me. And if you complain once more. You'll meet an army of me, army of meI wrote her off for the tenth time today. And practiced all the things I would say. When she came over, I lost my nerve. I took her back and made her dessert. Now I know I'm being used. That's okay man, 'cause I like the abuse. I know she's playing with me. That's okay 'cause I've got no self esteem. We make plans to go out at night. I wait till two then I turn out the light. This rejection's got me so low. If she keeps it up I just might tell her so. When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me. Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends. When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease. Then I wonder how much more I can spend. Well, I guess I should stick up for myself. But I really think it's better this way. The more you suffer. The more it shows you really care, right? Yeah. Now I'll relate this little bit. That happens more than I'd like to admit. Late at night she knocks on my door. She's drunk again and looking to score. Now I know I should say no. But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go. I may be dumb but I'm not a dweeb. I'm just a sucker with no self esteem. When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me. Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends. When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease. Then I wonder how much more I can spend. Well I guess I should stick up for myself. But I really think it's better this way. The more you suffer. The more it shows you really care, right? YeahShe sits alone by a lampost. Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind. She says "Dad's the one I love the most. But Stipe's not far behind". She never lets me in. Only tells me where she's been. When she's had too much to drink. I said that I don't care. I just run my hands through her dark hair. Then I pray to God, you gotta help me fly away. And just. Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain. Let her sing, if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me. And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Let her be. This morning I woke up alone. Found a note standin' by the phone. Saying "baby, maybe I'll be back someday". I wanted to look for you. You walked in; I didn't know just what I should do. So I sat back down and had a beer. And felt sorry for myself, sayin'. Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain. Let her sing, if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me. And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Let her be. Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain. Let her sing, if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me. And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Ahh.... Last night, I tried to leave. Cried so much, I could not believe. She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago. She went in the back to get high. I sat down on my couch and cried, yellin'. "Oh mama, please help me!. Won't you hold my hand and...?". Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain. Let her sing, if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me. And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain. Let her sing, if it eases all her pain. Let her go, let her walk right out on me. And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be. Oh, let her be.You and I in this moment, holding the night so close. Hanging on still unbroken, while outside the thunder rolls. Listen now, you can hear our heart beat. Warm against life's bitter cold... these are the days. The sweetest days we'll know. There are times that scare me, that rattle the house like wind. Both of us so unbending, we battle the fear within. All the while, life is rushing by us hold it now and don't let go. These are the days, the sweetest days we'll know. So we whisper a dream here in the darkness. Watching the stars til they're gone. And when even the memories have all faded away. These days go on and on. Listen now you can hear our heartbeat. Hold me now and don't let go. These are the days. Every day is the sweetest day we'll know. The sweetest days we'll knowIt's all because of you. I'm feelin' sad and blue. You went away. Now my life is just a rainy day. And I love you so. How much you'll never know. You've gone away and left me lonely. Untouchable memories. Seem to keep haunting me. Another love, so true. That once turned all my gray skies blue. But you disappeared. Now my eyes are filled with tear. And I'm wishing you were here with me. Soaked with love. All my thoughts of you. Now that you're gone. I just don't know what to do. If only you were here. You wash away my tears. The sun would shine. And once again you'll be me mine, oh, mine. But in reality. You and I will never be. 'Cause you took your love away from me. Girl, I don't know what I did. To make you leave me but what I do know. Is that since you've been gone. There's such an emptiness inside me. I'm wishin' you would come back to me. If only you were here. You'd wash away my tears. The sun would shine and once again. You'd me mine, oh, mine. But in reality. You and I will never be. 'Cause you took your love away from me, ah baby. You took your love away from meThey call me 'The Wild Rose'. But my name was Elisa Day. Why they call me it, I do not know. For my name was Elisa Day. From the first day I saw her, I knew she was the one. She stared in my eyes and smiled. For her lips were the color of the roses. That grew down the river, all bloody and wild. When he knocked on my door and entered the room. My trembling subsided in his sure embrace. He would be my first man and with a careful hand. He wiped at the tears that ran down my face. They call me 'The Wild Rose'. But my name was Elisa Day. Why they call me that, I do not know. For my name was Elisa Day. On the second day, I brought her a flower. She was more beautiful than any woman I've seen. I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow. So sweet and scarlet and free?". On the second day, he came with a single red rose. He said, "Give me your loss and your sorrow". I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed. "If I show you the roses, will you follow?". They call me 'The Wild Rose'. But my name was Elisa Day. Why they call me that, I do not know. For my name was Elisa Day. On the third day, he took me to the river. He showed me the roses and we kissed. And the last thing I heard was a muttered word. As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist. On the last day, I took her where the wild roses grow. She lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief. And I kissed her goodbye, said, "All beauty must die". And I lent down and planted a rose between her teeth. They call me 'The Wild Rose'. But my name was Elisa Day. Why they call me it, I do not know. For my name was Elisa Day. My name was Elisa Day. For my name was Elisa DayLet me lay it on the line. I got a little freakiness inside. And you know that the man. Has got to deal with it. I don't care what they say. I'm not about to pay nobody's way. 'Cause it's all about the dog in me. I want to freak in the morning. A freak in the evening. Just like me.

Goldeneye, I found his weakness. Goldeneye, he'll do what I please. Goldeneye, no time for sweetness. But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees. You'll never know how I watched you from the shadows as a child. You'll never know how it feels to be the one who's left behind. You'll never know the days and the nights, the tears, the tears I've cried. But now my time has come and time, time is not on your side. See him move through smoke and mirrors. Feel his presence in the crowd. Other girls they gather around him. If I had him I wouldn't let him out. Goldeneye, not lace or leather. Golden chain take him to the spot. Goldeneye, I'll show him forever. It will take forever to see what I've got. You'll never know how I watched you from the shadows as a child. You'll never know how it feels to get so close and be denied. It's a gold and honey trap I've got for you tonight. Revenge is a kiss this time I won't miss. Now I've got you in my sight. With a goldeneye. Golden, goldeneye. With a goldeneye, goldeneyeIt felt like spring time on this February morning. In a courtyard birds were singing your praise. I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright. I carried them with me today. Now. As I lay me down to sleep. This I pray. That you will hold me dear. Though I'm far away. I'll whisper your name into the sky. And I will wake up happy. I wonder why I feel so high. Though I am not above the sorrow. Heavy hearted. Till you call my name. And it sounds like church bells. Or the whistle of a train. On a summer evening. I'll run to meet you. Barefoot, barely breathing. As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh). This I pray. That you will hold me dear. Though I'm far away. I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh). And I will wake up happy. Oh, darling. As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh). This I pray. That you will hold me dear.

Every season has it's change. And I will see you. When the sun comes out again. As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh). This I pray. That you will hold me dear. Though I'm far away. I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh). And I will wake up happy. As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh). This I pray. That you will hold me dear. Though I'm far away.

Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames. And what do I get, for my pain. Betrayed desires, and a piece of the game. Even though I know, I suppose I'll show. All my cool and cold, like old job. Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage. Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage. Someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved". Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage. Now I'm naked, nothing but an animal. But can you fake it, for just one more show. And what do you want, I want to change. And what have you got when you feel the same. Even though I know, I suppose I'll show. All my cool and cold, like old job. Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.

I walk the maze of moments. but everywhere I turn to. begins a new beginning. but never finds a finish. I walk to the horizon. and there I find another. it all seems so surprising. and then I find that I know . . Chorus:. You go there you're gone forever. I go there I'll lose my way. if we stay here we're not together. Anywhere is . . The moon upon the ocean. is swept around in motion. but without ever knowing. the reason for its flowing. in motion on the ocean. the moon still keeps on moving. the waves still keep on waving. and I still keep on going . . Chorus . I wonder if the stars sign. the life that is to be mine. and would they let their light shine. enough for me to follow. I look up to the heavens. but night has clouded over. no spark of constellation. no Vela no Orion . . The shells upon the warm sands. have taken from their own lands. the echo of their story. but all I hear are low sounds. as pillow words are weaving. and willow waves are leaving. but should I be believing. . Chorus . To leave the thread of all time. and let it make a dark line. in hopes that I can still find. the way back to the moment. I took the turn and turned to. begin a new beginning. still looking for the answer. I cannot find the finish. It's either this or that way. it's one way or the other. it should be one direction. it could be on reflection. the turn I have just taken. the turn that I was making. I might be just beginning. I might be near the end.Your arms are warm but they make me feel. As if they're made of cold, cold steel. A simple kiss like a turnin' key. A little click and the lock's on me. Can't move my arms, can't lift my hands. I won't admit to where I am. But I know baby, I'm in chains. I'm in chains. I pretend I can always leave. Free to go whenever I please. But then the sound of my desperate calls. Echo off these dungeon walls. I've crossed the line from mad to sane. A thousand times and back again. I love you baby, I'm in chains. I'm in chains. I'm in chains. I'm in chains. Should have known passing through the gate. That once inside I could not escape. I never thought this could happen to me. Never thought this is where I'd be. But baby, baby, baby, look at me. Baby, baby, look at me, I'm in chains. I'm in chains. I never thought this is where I'd be. Never thought this could happen to meYou could ever change your heart. If you would only change your mind. Instead of slammin' down the phone, girl, for the hundredth time. I got your number on my wall. But I ain't gonna make that call. When divided we stand, baby, united we fall. Got the time, got a chance, gonna make it. Got my hands on your heart, gonna take it. All I know, I can't fight this way. You could ever change your heart. If you would only change your mind. 'Cause I'm crazy about you, baby, time after time. Without you, one night alone. Is like a year without you, baby. Do you have a heart of stone?. Without you, can't stop the hurt inside. When love and hate collide. I don't want to fight no more. I don't know what we're fighting for. When we treat each other, baby, like an act of war. I can tell a million lies, I would come as no surprise. When the truth is like a stranger. It hits you right between the eyes. There's a time and a place and a reason. And I know I got a love to believe in. All I know, got to win this time. Without you, one night alone. Is like a year without you, baby. Do you have a heart of stone?. Without you, can't stop the hurt inside. When love and hate collide. You could ever change your heart. If you would only change your mind. 'Cause I'm crazy about you baby, crazy, crazy. Without you, one night alone. Is like a year without you baby. Do you have a heart of stone?. Without you, one night alone. Is like a year without you baby. If you have a heart of stone?. Without you, can't stop the hurt inside. When love and hate collideI want to be a hippie....

We'll walk upon the water. We'll rise above the mess. With a little peace and some harmony. We'll take the world together. We'll take 'em by the hand. 'Cause I've got a hand for you. 'Cause I wanna run with you. Yesterday, I saw you standing there. Your head was down, your eyes were red. No comb had touched your hair. I said get up, and let me see you smile. We'll take a walk together. Walk the road a while, 'cause. 'Cause I've got a hand for you. I've got a hand for you. 'Cause I wanna run with you. Won't you let me run with you? yeah. Hold my hand.

Oh, The best that I canOnce upon a midnight, dearie. I woke with something in my head. I couldn't escape the memory. Of a phone call and of what you said. Like a game show contestant with a parting gift. I could not believe my eyes. When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend. Who needs to humor me and tell me lies, yeah humor me and tell me lies. And I'll lie too and say I don't mind. And as we seek so shall we find. And when you're feeling open I'll still be here. But not without a certain degree of fear. Of what will be with you and me. I still can see things hopefully. But you. Why you wanna give me a run-around?. Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up?. When all it does is slow me down. And shake me and my confidence. About a great many things. But I've been there I can see it cower. Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings. Of a bad play where the heroes are right. And nobody thinks or expects too much. And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights. Singing "Hey babe, let's keep in touch", hey baby, let's keep in touch. But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me. And show me all the things no one else can see. So what you feel becomes mine as well. And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell. What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine. And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line. But you. Why you wanna give me a run-around?. Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up?. When all it does is slow me down. Tra la la la la bombardier, this is the pilot speaking. And I've got some news for you. It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop. And there ain't a whole lot that you can do. Oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder. Perhaps I've grown a little cynical. But I know no matter what the waitress brings. I shall drink in and always be full, yeah I will drink in and always be full. Oh I like coffee and I like tea. I'd like to be able to enter a final plea. I still got this dream that you just can't shake. I love you to the point you can no longer take. Well all right okay, so be that way. I hope and pray that there's something left to say. But you. Why you wanna give me a run-around?. Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up. When all it does is slow me down?. Oh you. Why you wanna give me a run-around?. Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up. When all it does is slow me down?Wish you were here. me oh my countryman. wish you were here.

Baby babyShe came from Greece she had a thirst for knowledge. She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's college. That's where I caught her eye. She told me that her dad was loaded. I said, "In that case I'll have a rum, Coca Cola". She said, "Fine". And then in thirty seconds time she said. I wanna live like common people. I wanna do whatever common people do. Wanna sleep with common people. I wanna sleep with common people like you. Oh, what else could I do. I said, "I'll, I'll see what I can do". I took her to a supermarket. I don't know why. But I had to start it somewhere. So it started there. I said, "Pretend you've got no money". And she just laughed and said, "Oh you're so funny". I said, "Yeah?. I can't see anyone else smiling in here". Are you sure you want to live like common people. You wanna see whatever common people see. Wanna sleep with common people. You wanna sleep with common people like me. But she didn't understand. And she just smiled and held my hand. Rent a flat above a shop. Cut your hair and get a job. Smoke some fags and play some pool. Pretend you never went to school. But still you'll never get it right. 'Cos when you're laid in bed at night. Watching roaches climb the wall. If you call your dad he could stop it all, yeah. You'll never live like common people. You'll never do whatever common people do. You'll never fail like common people. You'll never watch your life slide out of view. And the dance and drink and screw. Because there's nothing else to do. Sing along with the common people. Sing along and it might just get you through. Laugh along with the common people. Laugh along even though they're laughing at you. And the stupid things that you do. Because you think that boy is cool. Like a dog lying in a corner. They will bite you and never warn you. Look out they'll tear your insides out. 'Cos everybody hates a tourist. Especially one who thinks it's all such a laugh. Yeah and the chip stains grease. Will come out in the bath. You will never understand. How it feels to live your life. With no meaning or control. And I'm with nowhere left to go. You are amazed that they exist. And they burn so bright. While you can only wonder. Why rent a flat above a shop. Cut your hair and get a job. Smoke some fags and play some pool. Pretend you never went to school. But still you'll never get it right. 'Cos when you're laid in bed at night. Watching roaches climb the wall. If you called your dad he could stop it all, yeah. Never live like common people. Never do what common people do. Never fail like common people. Never watch your life slide out of view. And dance and drink and screw. Because there's nothing else to do. Wanna live with common people like you. Wanna live with common people like you. Wanna live with common people like you. Wanna live with common people like you. Wanna live with common people like you. Wanna live with common people like you. Wanna live with common people like you. Oh yeahI didn't ask. They shouldn't have told me. At first I'd laugh, but now. It's sinking in fast. Whatever they've sold me. Well baby I don't want to take advice from fools. I'll just figure everything is cool. Until I hear it from you. It gets hard. The memory's faded. Who gets what they say. It's likely they're just jealous and jaded. Well maybe I don't want to take advice from fools. I'll just figure everything is cool. Until I hear it from you. Until I hear it from you. I can't let it get me off. Or break up my train of thought. As far as I know, nothing's wrong. Until I hear it from you. Still thinking about not living without it. Outside looking in. Til we're talking about it, not stepping around it. Maybe. I don't want to take advice from fools. I'll just figure everything is cool. Until I hear it from you (hear it from you).

You saw the best there was in me. . Lifted me up when I couldn't reach. You gave me faith 'cause you believed. I'm everything I am. Because you loved me. . You were always there for me. The tender wind that carried me. A light in the dark shining your love into my life. You've been my inspiration. Through the lies you were the truth. My world is a better place because of you. . You were my strength when I was weak. You were my voice when I couldn't speak. You were my eyes when I couldn't see. You saw the best there was in me. . Lifted me up when I couldn't reach. You gave me faith 'cause you believed. I'm everything I am. Because you loved meDon't leave me in all this pain. Don't leave me out in the rain. Come back and bring back my smile. Come and take these tears away. I need your arms to hold me now. The nights are so unkind. Bring back those nights when I held you beside me. Un-break my heart. Say you'll love me again. Undo this hurt you caused. When you walked out the door. And walked out of my life. Un-cry these tears. I cried so many nights. Un-break my heart. My heart. Take back that sad word good-bye. Bring back the joy to my life. Don't leave me here with these tears. Come and kiss this pain away. I can't forget the day you left. Time is so unkind. And life is so cruel without you here beside me. Un-break my heart. Say you'll love me again. Undo this hurt you caused. When you walked out the door. And walked out of my life. Un-cry these tears. I cried so many nights. Un-break my heart. My heart. Don't leave me in all this pain. Don't leave me out in the rain. Bring back the nights when I held you beside me. Un-break my heart. Say you'll love me again. Undo this hurt you caused. When you walked out the door. And walked out of my life. Un-cry this tears. I cried so many, many nights. Un-break my. Un-break my heart oh baby. Come back and say you love me. Un-break my heart. Sweet darlin'. Without you I just can't go on. Can't go on...I step off the train. I'm walking down your street again. And past your door, but you don't live there anymore. It's years since you've been there. Now you've disappeared somewhere, like outer space. You've found some better place. And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain. And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain. Could you be dead?. You always were two steps ahead, of everyone. We'd walk behind while you would run. I look up at your house. And I can almost hear you shout down to me. Where I always used to be. And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain. And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain. Back on the train, I ask why did I come again?. Can I confess, I've been hanging round your old address?. And the years have proved. To offer, nothing since you've moved. You're long gone, but I can't move on. And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain. And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain. And I miss you. I step off the train. I'm walking down your street again. And past your door, I guess you don't live there anymore. It's years since you've been there. Now you've disappeared somewhere, like outer space. You've found some better place. And I miss you,. And I miss you,. You found some better place. And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain. And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain. And I miss you, and I miss you. Like the deserts miss the rain. And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain. The deserts miss the rain. Like the deserts miss the rain. Like the deserts miss the rain,. Like the deserts miss the rain. And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain[Instrumental]Today is gonna be the day. That they're gonna throw it back to you. By now you should've somehow. Realized what you gotta do. I don't believe that anybody. Feels the way I do about you now. Back beat, the word is on the street. That the fire in your heart is out. I'm sure you've heard it all before. But you never really had a doubt. I don't believe that anybody. Feels the way I do about you now. And all the roads we have to walk are winding. And all the lights that lead us there are blinding. There are many things that I would like to say to you. But I don't know how. Because maybe. You're gonna be the one that saves me. And after all. You're my wonderwall. Today was gonna be the day. But they'll never throw it back to you. By now you should've somehow. Realized what you're not to do. I don't believe that anybody. Feels the way I do about you now. And all the roads that lead you there were winding. And all the lights that light the way are blinding. There are many things that I would like to say to you. But I don't know how. I said maybe. You're gonna be the one that saves me. And after all. You're my wonderwall. I said maybe. You're gonna be the one that saves me. And after all. You're my wonderwall. I said maybe. You're gonna be the one that saves me. You're gonna be the one that saves me. You're gonna be the one that saves meAn old man turned ninety-eight. He won a lottery and died the next day. It's a black fly in your chardonnay. It's a death row pardon two minutes too late. Isn't it ironic? Don't you think?. . It's like rain on your wedding day. It's a free ride when you've already paid. It's the good advice that you just didn't take. Who would've thought it figures. . Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly. He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye. He waited his whole damn life to take that flight. And as the plane crashed down he thought. Well, isn't this nice? Isn't this ironic? Don't you think?. . It's like rain on your wedding day. It's a free ride when you've already paid. It's the good advice that you just didn't take. Who would've thought it figures. . Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you. When you think everything's okay and everything's going right. And ya well life has a funny way of helping you out when. You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up in your face. . A traffic jam when you're already late. A no smoking sign on your cigarette break. It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife. It's meeting the man of my dreams and then meeting his beautiful wife. Isn't it ironic don't you think a little too ironic and yeah I really do think. . It's like rain on your wedding day. It's a free ride when you've already paid. It's the good advice that you just didn't take. And who would've thought it figuresIf God had a name what would it be?. And would you call it to His face?. If you were faced with Him in all His glory. What would you ask if you had just one question?. And yeah, yeah God is great. Yeah, yeah God is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What if God was one of us?. Just a slob like one of us. Just a stranger on the bus. Trying to make His way home. If God had a face what would it look like?. And would you want to see?. If seeing meant that you would have to believe. In things like Heaven and in Jesus and the Saints. And all the Prophets. And yeah, yeah God is great. Yeah, yeah God is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What if God was one of us?. Just a slob like one of us. Just a stranger on the bus. Trying to make His way home. Tryin' to make His way home. Back up to Heaven all alone. Nobody callin' on the phone. 'Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome. Yeah, yeah God is great. Yeah, yeah God is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What if God was one of us?. Just a slob like one of us. Just a stranger on the bus. Trying to make His way home. Just tryin' to make His way home. Like a holy rolling stone. Back up to Heaven all alone. Just tryin' to make His way home. Nobody callin' on the phone. 'Cept for the Pope maybe in RomeKindness in your eyes. I guess you heard me cry. You smiled at me. Like, Jesus to a child. I'm blessed, I know. Heaven sent, heaven stole. You smiled at me. Like, Jesus to a child. And what have I learned. From all this pain. I thought I never feel the same. About anyone. Or anything again. But now I know. When you find love. When you know that it exists. Then the lover that you miss. Will come to you on those cold, cold nights. When you've been loved. When you know it holds such bliss. Then the lover that you kissed. Will comfort you when there is no hope in sight. Sadness in my eyes. No one guessed, well no one tried. You smiled at me. Like, Jesus to a child. Loveless and cold. With your last breathe you saved my soul. You smiled at me. Like, Jesus to a child. And what have I learned. From all these tears. I've waited for you all those years. Then just when it began. He took your love away. But I still say. When you find love. When you know that it exists. Then the lover that you miss. Will come to you on those cold, cold nights. When you've been loved. When you know it holds such bliss. Then the lover that you kissed. Comfort you when there is no hope in sight. So the words you could not say. I'll sing them for you. And the love we would have made. I'll make it for two. For every single memory. Has become a part of me. You will always be. My love. Well I've been loved. So I know just what love is. And the lover that I kissed is always by my side. Oh,  the lover I still miss. Was Jesus to a childSpaceman.

Of light mists with pale amber rose. Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent. Touching, discovering you. Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me. Miles of windless sumkmer nights. Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon. Out of the stillness, soft spoken words. Say it, say it again. I love you always forever. Near or far, closer together. Everywhere I will be with you. Everything I will do for you. Say it, say it again. I love you always forever. Near or far, closer together. Everywhere I will be with you. Everything I will do for you. You've got. The most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen. You've got. Me almost melting away. As we lay there. Under a blue sky with pure white stars. Exotic sweetness. A magical time. Say it, say it again. I love you always forever. Near or far, closer together. Everywhere I will be with you. Everything I will do for you. Say it, say it again. I love you always forever. Near or far, closer together. Everywhere I will be with you. Everything I will do for you.

Loud voice booming, "Please step out onto the line". Pele preaches words of comfort, Zina just hides her eyes. Policeman taps his shades, "Is that a Chevy '69?". How bizarre. How bizarre, how bizarre. Destination unknown, as we pull in for some gas. Freshly pasted poster reveals a smile from the past. Elephants and acrobats, lions snakes monkey. Pele speaks "righteous," Sister Zina says "funky". How bizarre. How bizarre, how bizarre. Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby). It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy). Everytime I look around. Everytime I look around (Everytime I look around). Everytime I look around. It's in my face. Ring master steps out and says "the elephants left town". People jump and jive, but the clowns have stuck around. TV news and camera, there's choppers in the sky. Marines, police, reporters ask where, for and why. Pele yells, "We're outta here," Zina says, "Right on". We're making moves and starting grooves before they knew we were gone. Jumped into the Chevy and headed for big lights. Wanna know the rest? Hey, buy the rights.... How bizarre. How bizarre, how bizarre. Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby). It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy). Everytime I look around. Everytime I look around (Everytime I look around). Everytime I look around. It's in my face[Featuring: Dr. Dre]. . California love!. . [1:]. California... knows how to party.

I wanna know. You leave without a word, no message, no number. And now my head is pounding like rolling thunder. You left me with a heartache deep inside. Girl, you should see me cry all night, and I wonder. Everybody says, "What a shame, what is wrong?". They don't like the game we play. Heard you're hanging 'round every night until dawn. I'm waiting for you night and day. Where do you go, my lovely?. Where do you go?. I wanna know, my lovely, I wanna know. You gotta break the silence, don't keep me waiting. Just like a river flowing to the sea. You're running back to me. Come, hear what I'm saying. Where do you go, my lovely?. I wanna know. Where do you go, oh, oh, oh?. Where do you go, oh, oh, oh?. I wanna know. Where do you, where do you go?. Save me. Come back and dry the tears, I cried for you, baby. You've gotta stop this heartache deep inside. You've gotta help me make it through the night safely. Come back and save meYou know what. I like the playettes. No diggity, no doubt, uh. Play on playette. Play on playette. Yo Dre, drop the verse. It's going down, fade to Blackstreet. The homies got RB, collab' creations. Bump like Acne, no doubt. I put it down, never slouch. As long as my credit can vouch. A dog couldn't catch me straight up. Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves. Attracting honeys like a magnet. Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent. Still moving this flavour. With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy. The original rump shakers. Shorty get down, good Lord. Baby got 'em open all over town. Strictly biz, you don't play around. Cover much ground, got game by the pound. Getting paid is a forte. Each and every day, true player way. I can't get her out of my mind. (Well). I think about the girl all the time (well, well). East side to the west side. Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise. She got tricks in the stash. Stacking up the cash. Fast when it comes to the gas. By no means average. She's on when she's got to have it. Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in. Can I get down, so I can win. I like the way you work it. No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up. She's got class and style. Street knowledge by the pound,. Baby never act wild. Very low key on the profile. Catching feelings is a no,. Let me tell you how it goes. Herb's the word, spin's the verb. Lovers it curves so freak what you heard. Rollin' with the phatness. You don't even know what the half is. You got to pay to play. Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way. I like the way you work it. Trumped tight, all day, every day. You're blowing my mind, maybe in time. Baby, I can get you in my ride. I like the way you work it. No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up. Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo. Hey yo, that girl looks good. Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo. Play on, play on playette. Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo. You're my kind of girl, no diggity. Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo. Hey. Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep. Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet. What you know about me, not a motherfucking thing. Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie. As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring. We be's the baddest clique up on the scene. Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads. I shows and proves, no doubt, I predicted so. Please excuse, if I come across rude. That's just me. And that's how a playette's got to be. Stay kicking game with a capital G. Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be. Word is born, faking moves never been my thing. So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy. I'll be sending a call, let's say around 3: 30. Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity. I like the way you work it. No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up. Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo. Hey yo, that girl looks good. Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo. Play on, play on playette. Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo. You're my kind of girl, no diggity. Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo. HeyThere were nights when the wind was so cold. That my body froze in bed. If i just listened to it. Right outside the window. . There were days when the sun was so cruel. That all the tears turned to dust. And i just knew my eyes were. Drying up forever. . I finished crying in the instant that you left. And i can't remember where or when or how. And i banished every memory you and i had ever made. . But when you touch me like this. And you hold me like that. I just have to admit. That it's all coming back to me. When i touch you like this. And i hold you like that. It's so hard to believe but. It's all coming back to me. (it's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now). . There were moments of gold. And there were flashes of light. There were things i'd never do again. But then they'd always seemed right. There were nights of endless pleasure. It was more than any laws allow. Baby baby. . If i kiss you like this. And if you whisper like that. It was lost long ago. But it's all coming back to me. If you want me like this. And if you need me like that. It was dead long ago. But it's all coming back to me. It's so hard to resist. And it's all coming back to me. I can barely recall. But it's all coming back to me now. But it's all coming back. . There were those empty threats and hollow lies. And whenever you tried to hurt me. I just hurt you even worse. And so much deeper. . There were hours that just went on for days. When alone at last we'd count up all the chances. That were lost to us forever. . But you were history with the slamming of the door. And i made myself so strong again somehow. And i never wasted any of my time on you since then. . But if i touch you like this. And if you kiss me like that. It was so long ago. But it's all coming back to me. If you touch me like this. And if i kiss you like that. It was gone with the wind. But it's all coming back to me. (it's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now). . There were moments of gold. And there were flashes of light. There were things we'd never do again. But then they'd always seemed right. There were nights of endless pleasure. It was more than all your laws allow. Baby, baby, baby. . When you touch me like this. And when you hold me like that. It was gone with the wind. But it's all coming back to me. When you see me like this. And when i see you like that.

June bug skipping like a stone. With the headlights pointed at the dawn. We were sure we'd never see an end to it all. And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues. And we don't know just where our bones will rest. To dust, I guess; forgotten and absorbed. To the earth below. Double cross the vacant and the bored. They're not sure just what we have in store. Morphine city slippin' dues down to see. That we don't even care as restless as we are. We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts. And poured cement, lamented and assured. To the lights and towns below. Faster than the speed of sound. Faster than we thought we'd go. Beneath the sound of hope. Justine never knew the rules. Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls. No apologies ever need be made. I know you better than you fake it to see. That we don't even care to shake these zipper blues. And we don't know just where our bones will rest. To dust, I guess; forgotten and absorbed. To the earth below. The street heats the urgency of now. As you see there's no one aroundThe sky isn't always blue. The sun doesn't always shine. It's alright to fall apart sometimes. I am not always you. And you are not always mine. It's alright to fall apart sometimes. After all is said and done. One and one still is one. When we cry, when we laugh. I am half, you are half. The heart isn't always true. And I am not always fine. We all have an angry heart sometimes. After all is said and done. One and one still is one. When we cry, when we laugh. I am half, you are half. Look how far we have come. One and one still is. One moon (one moon), one star (one star). I love the one we are. One thread (one thread), one line (one line). Let's stand still in time. One moon (one moon), one star (one star). I love the one we are. One thread (one thread), one line (one line). That runs through our lives. After all is said and done. One and one still is one. When we cry, when we laugh. I am half, you are half. Look how far we have come. One and one still is oneWish I'd told her how I felt, then maybe she'd be here right now, but. Instead. I pretended I'm glad you went away. These four walls closing more everyday. And I'm dyin' inside. And nobody knows it but me. Like a clown I put on a show. The pain is real even if nobody knows. And I'm cryin' inside. And nobody knows it but me. Why didn't I say, the things I needed to say. How could I let my angel get away. Now my world is just a tumblin' down. I can say it so clearly, but you're nowhere around. The nights are lonely, the days are so sad. And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had. And I'm missin' you. And nobody know it but me. I carry a smile when I'm broken in two. And I'm nobody without someone like you. I'm tremblin' inside. And nobody knows it but me. I lie awake it's a quarter past three. I'm screamin' at night if I thought you'd hear me. Yeah, my heart is callin' you. And nobody knows it but me. How blue can I get, you could ask my heart. But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart. A million words couldn't say just how I feel. A million years from now you know I'll be lovin' you still. The nights are lonely the days are so sad. And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had. And I'm missin' you. And nobody knows it but me. Yeah, Ohh, uhh, whoa, omom. Nobody, nobody, but me. Tomorrow morning I'm hittin' the dusty road. Gonna find you where ever, ever you might go. And I'm gonna unload my heart. And hope you come back to me. Yeah, sad when the nights are lonely. The nights are lonely, the days are so sad. And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had.

Pick up my pen and start to write. I struggle, fight dark forces. In the clear moon light. Without fear... insomnia. I can't get no sleep. . I used to worry, thought I was goin' mad in a hurry. Gettin' stress, makin' excess mess in darkness. No electricity, something's all over me, greasy. Insomnia please release me and let me dream of. Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath. Tearin' off tights with my teeth. But there's no release, no peace. I toss and turn without cease. Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast. At least a couple of weeks. Since I last slept, kept takin' sleepers. But now I keep myself pepped. Deeper still, that night I write by candle light. I find insight, fundamental movement, uh. So when it's back this insomniac take an original tack. Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack. I gets no sleep. I can't get no sleep. . I can't get no sleep. I can't get no sleep. I need to sleep, although I get no sleep. I need to sleep, although I get no sleepI'll give you love, the things you want. Ooh, and I would do anything for you. I would do anything for you.

This isn't where we intended to be. We had it all, you believed in me. I believed in you. . Certainties disappear. What do we do for our dream to survive?. How do we keep all our passions alive,. As we used to do?. . Bridge:. . Deep in my heart I'm concealing. Things that I'm longing to say. Scared to confess what I'm feeling. Frightened you'll slip away. . Chorus:. . You must love me. You must love me. . Why are you at my side?. How can I be any use to you now?. Give me a chance and I'll let you see how. Nothing has changed. . (bridge). (chorus). . You must love meOoo Heh heh, Oh, what we're living in, let me tell ya. It is a wonder man can eat at all. When things are big that should be small. Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us. And I'm giving all my love to this world. Only to be told. I can't see, I can't breathe. No more will we be. And nothing's going to change the way we live. 'Cause we can always take but never give. And now that things are changing for the worse. See, whoa, it's a crazy world we're living in. And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin. Is all we have to give these. Futures made of virtual insanity now. Always seem to be governed by this love we have for. Useless, twisting, of our new technology. Oh now there is no sound, for we all live underground. And I'm thinking what a mess we're in. Hard to know where to begin. If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made. And now every mother can choose the colour of her child. That's not nature's way. Well that's what they said yesterday. There's nothing left to do but pray. I think it's time to find a new religion. Whoa, It's so insane. To synthesize another strain. There's something in these. Futures that we have to be told. Futures made of virtual insanity now. Always seem to be governed by this love we have for. useless, twisting, of our new technology. Oh now there is no sound, for we all live underground. Now there is no sound if we all live underground. If there was virtual insanity. Forget your virtual reality. Oh, there's nothing so bad. As a man-made man, oh yeah, I know. Yeah. Ooh. Futures made of virtual insanity now. Always seem to be governed by this love we have for. Useless, twisting, of the new technology. Oh now there is no sound, for we all live underground. Now this life that we live in. It's so wrong. Shout out the window. Do you know that. There is nothing worse than a man-made man. Still there's nothing worse than a foolish man, hey. Virtual insanity is what we're living in. Yeah, it is alrightAnd even though the moment's passed me by. I still can't turn away. 'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose. Get tossed along the way. The letters that you never meant to send. Get lost and thrown away. And now we've grown up orphans I'd never knew their names. We don't belong to no one thats a shame. But you could hide beside me maybe for a while. And I won't tell no one your name. And I won't tell 'em your name. And scars are souvenirs you'll never lose. The past is never far. And did you lose yourself somewhere out there?. Did you get to be a star?. And don't it make you sad to know that life. Is more than who we are?. You grew up way too fast now there's nothing to believe. With re-runs all become our history. A tired song keeps playin' on a tired radio. And I won't tell no one your name. I won't tell 'em your name, yeah, yeah. And I won't tell 'em your name. Oh, oh, I won't tell em your name. I think about you all the time. But I don't need the same. It's lonely where you are, come back down. I won't tell 'em your nameI've been long, a long way from here. Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes. And drank till I was thirsty again. We went searching through thrift store jungles. Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo. And Benny Goodman's corset and pen. Well OK, I made this up. I promised you I'd never give up. If it makes you happy. It can't be that bad. If it makes you happy. Then why the hell are you so sad?. You get down, real low down. You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train. Well who hasn't been there before?. I come 'round, around the hard way. Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread. And serve you French toast again. Well OK, I still get stoned. I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home. If it makes you happy. It can't be that bad. If it makes you happy. Then why the hell are you so sad?. If it makes you happy. It can't be that bad. If it makes you happy. Then why the hell are you so sad?. We've been far, far away from here. Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes. And everywhere in between. Well OK, we get along. So what if right now everything's wrong?. If it makes you happy. It can't be that bad. If it makes you happy. Then why the hell are you so sad?. If it makes you happy. It can't be that bad. If it makes you happy. Then why the hell are you so sad?You're my love, you're my sweetest thing. Don't shy away, don't shy away. Every night makes me hate the days. Can't get enough of your love. Am I wrong? Am I so unkind?. Show me the way, don't turn away. I can't hide all these thoughts in my mind. Every moment I'm thinking of you. Ooh aah, just a little bit. Ooh aah, little bit more. Ooh aah, just a little bit. You know what I'm looking for. Ooh aah, just a little bit. Ooh aah, little bit more. Ooh aah, just a little bit. I'll give you love you can't ignore. Feeling good, let's go all the way. It's got to be, set me free. But tonight let my body say. Take it slow, don't let it go. How can I prove my love to you?. Baby please, you're all I need. Like a child but it's more than a phase. Could act the angel but it wouldn't be true. Ooh aah, just a little bit. Ooh aah, little bit more. Ooh aah, just a little bit. You know what I'm looking for. Ooh aah, just a little bit. Ooh aah, little bit more. Ooh aah, just a little bit. I'll give you love you can't ignore. What can you do for me?. Oh, what can you do?. 'Cause I feel so alive. I feel your love inside, ooh. Just a little bit, little bit more. Just a little bit, just a little. Just a little bit, little bit more. Just a little bit. Ooh aah, just a little bit. Ooh aah, little bit more. Ooh aah, just a little bit. You know what I'm looking for. Ooh aah, just a little bit. Ooh aah, little bit more. Ooh aah, just a little bit. I'll give you love you can't ignore. Ooh aah, just a little bit. Ooh aah, little bit more. Ooh aah, just a little bit. You know what I'm looking for. Ooh aah, just a little bit. Ooh aah, little bit more. Ooh aah, just a little bit. I'll give you love you can't ignore. Just a little bit, little bit more. Just a little bit, just a little. Just a little bit, little bit more. Just a little bitOh yeah. Well, I don't look good in no Armani suits. No Gucci shoes or designer boots. I tried the latest lines from A to Z. But there's just one thing that looks good on me. The only thing I want, yeah. The only thing I need, ah. The only thing I choose, yeah. The only thing that looks good on me. Is you. I'm not satisfied with Versace style. Put those patent leather pants in the circular file. Sometimes I think, I might be lookin' good. But there's only one thing that fits like it should. The only thing I want, ah. The only thing I need, oh yeah. The only thing I choose, come on. The only thing that looks good on me. Is you. Ya, it's you. It could only be you. Nobody else will ever do. Oh, baby it's you.

Yeah, Richie Rich, E-40, Spice 1. You say you got five on my tenda. You can bend over the table. But be sure bring my stallion back to my stable. Say, brush?. No elementary school ground plan. Not a five dollar bill. But five double zero on the real, feel. I'm on the level, stair mellow. No criticism from the fellows, hello. Being keyed during a high speed. But still don't tap the B.B.s. I'm dizzy, Dru Down, baby. Like Nyquil, I drop fever, so either put your five up. Or ya gots to leave it like beaver 'cause see ya. Nigge Perk land broke and smoke ya spliff all day. Go home and buy big tricky with his pretty Impala. I got five on the Hennessey, Segrims and 40's. Cause this is how we do it like Montell Jordan. I'm from the Oakland city, framed nigge is a gonna. Now I'm blowin' it up like Oklahoma. Put ya five with my fin, best believe we'll bend. Mo corners than you thought, to somethin' writers bought. More sizz-acks, believe that talkin', where you from?. Oakland. Smokin' in attempts to crack the chest plate. The zips be so fluffy, the whole town loves me. An every event I'm sacked up. So if ya need me, scream double R when ya see me. I got five on it, grab ya four, let's get keyed. I got five on it, messin' wit' dat indo weed. I got five on it, it's got me stuck and toed back. I got five on it, potna, let's go half on a sack. E-40, why ya treat me so bad?. 40 makes it happen, fives gets slapped. And rubbin' them girls just a little bit of light weight. Flamboyant, potent fumes lingerin' mighty clouds and molten lights. You expect to bit the baron an you'll be violatin' my civil rights. I'm startin' to feel my scrilla but perhaps today my scrilla ain't feelin' me. For the simple fact that I'm off to the track with hella fools three. Pockets empty, pitchin' five, man I'm dusted took off my hat. Passed it around, sprinkle me. Me an E-40 to the head, comin' fifth, plus. You let the lead bust, ready to do a murda, man?. Curved off the Hurricane, hurled again. Witness we'll bein' off two-fifths equal. Killing people like Jason, facin' death every sequel. (Insane in the membrane). Bring the pain like Method neglected. Smokin' crips to the night to the brains for breakfast. 'Cause for the indo fins do the evil that men do. Give me five and I shall proceed and continue. I got five on it, grab ya four, let's get keyed. I got five on it, messin' wit' dat indo weed. I got five on it, it's got me stuck and toed back. I got five on it, potna, let's go half on a sack. Yeah, it's been a while since I've hollered from the town. Mess around heard young genome said, "I've gotta be down". 'Cause new styles is goin' down, look around you. Tunes from the Luniz spread round an round you. Back to get my O on, they let me flow on. The thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it. Still brinin' satin for them draws. Velvet for the mic and got a pound for the 'cause. Rollin' up the cannabis, hittin' the Mary Jane. Smokin' the five before it's twelve o'clock. Sippin' on Hurricane, ready to smoke on the indo. Rollin' up my window, fittin' to go to the land. With a hand fulla broccoli. When it comes to the sticky, I'm the man. Crunch nasty, I be hittin' the jank so hard I hurl. Fall on the floor fittin' to have a stroke THC ain't no joke. I got five on everything, let's get loaded and smoke. S P I C E about to hit it an croak. I got five on it, grab ya four, let's get keyed. I got five on it, messin' wit' dat indo weed. I got five on it, it's got me stuck and toed back. I got five on it, potna, let's go half on a sack. Ha ha, wassup baby. It's me, your boy to keep the song always tight. You little short on some ends?. Don't worry, I'll take care of that, I got youReady Or Not, Here I Come. You Can't Hide. Gonna Find You. And Take it Slowly. Ready Or Not, Here I Come. You Can't Hide. Gonna Find You. And Make you want me. Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake. Those who could relate know the world ain't cake. Jail bars ain't golden gates Those who fake, they break,. When they meet their 400 pound mate. If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun. In the ghetto of course, when giddyupin' on their horse. I kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine. I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased. But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep. Thinkin' 'bout the robbery, that I did last week.. Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag. I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad. Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit. My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist. I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends. A born again hooligan only to be king again. Ready Or Not, Here I Come. You Can't Hide. Gonna Find You. And Take it Slowly. Ready Or Not, Here I Come. You Can't Hide. Gonna Find You. And Make you want me. Yo, I play my enemies like a game of chess. Where I rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess, lest. I must confess, my destiny's manifest. In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless. Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess. Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes. Bless you if you represent the Fu. But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're Doo Doo. Voo Doo, I can do what you do, easy. Belive me, frontin' niggas give me hee-bee-gee-bees. So while you're imitating Al Capone. I'll be Nina Simone and defacating on your microphone. Ready Or Not, Here I Come. You Can't Hide. Gonna Find You. And Take it Slowly. You can't run away. From these styles I got,. Oh baby, hey baby. Cause I got a lot, oh yeah. And anywhere you go. My whole crew's gonna know,. Oh baby, hey baby. You can't hide from the block, oh no. Ready or not, refugees takin' over. The Buffalo soldier, dread-lock rasta. On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber. Crews run for cover, now they're under pushin' up flowers. Superfly true lies, do or die,. Toss me high - only puff la, With my crew from lock high. I refugee from Guantanamo Bay. Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes). Ready Or Not, Here I Come. You Can't Hide. Gonna Find You. And Take it Slowly. Ready Or Not, Here I Come. You Can't Hide (Ay, yo, nobody move). Gonna Find You. And Make you want me. Ready Or Not, Here I Come. You Can't Hide. Gonna Find You. And Take it Slowly. Ready Or Not, Here I Come. You Can't Hide. Gonna Find You. And Make you want meI had no choice but to hear you. You stated your case time and again. I thought about it. .

Don't you think I know exactly where I stand. This world is forcing me to hold your hand. 'Cause I'm just a girl, oh, little old me. Don't let me out of your sight. Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite. So don't let me have any rights. Oh, I've had it up to here. The moment that I step outside. So many reasons for me to run and hide. I can't do the little things I love so dear. 'Cause it's all those little things that I fear. 'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be. 'Cause they won't let me drive late at night. I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak. 'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes. Oh, I'm just a girl take a good look at me. Just your typical prototype, oh, I've had it up to here. Oh, am I making myself clear?. I'm just a girl, I'm just a girl in the world. That's all that you'll let me be. Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity. Your rule of thumb make me worry so. Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?. What I've succumbed to is making me numb. Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies. What I've become is so burdensome. Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me. Twiddle dum there's no comparison. Oh, I've had it up to. Oh, I've had it up to. Oh, I've had it up to hereSmile an ever lasting smile. A smile can bring you near to me. Don't ever let me find you gone. 'Cos that would bring a tear to me. This world has lost its glory. Let's start a brand new story. Now my love. You think that I don't even mean. A single word I say. It's only words. And words are all I have. To take your heart away. Talk in ever lasting words. And dedicate them all to me. And I will give you all my life. I'm hear if you should call to me. You think that I don't even mean. A single word I say. It's only words. And words are all I have. To take your heart away. It's only words. And words are all I have. To take your heart away. Da da da da da da da. Da da da da da da da da da da. Da da da da da da da. Da da da da da da da da da da. This world has lost its glory. Let's start a brand new story. Now my love. You think that I don't even mean. A single word I say. It's only words. And words are all I have. To take your heart away. It's only words. And words are all I have. To take your heart away. It's only words. And words are all I have. To take your heart awayLife, I wonder. Will it take me under, I don't know. Imagine smokin' weed in the streets without cops harassin'. Imagine goin' to court with no trial. Lifestyle cruisin' blue behind my waters, no welfare supporters. More conscious of the way we raise our daughters. Days are shorter, nights are colder. Feelin' like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra. The world's hot, my son got not evidently. It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually. Troopin' out of state for a plate knowledge. Of coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars. Imagine everybody flashin', fashion. Designer clothes, lacin' your click up with diamond vogues. Your people holdin' dough, no parole. No rubbers, go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers. Just some thoughts for the mind, I take a glimpse into time. Watch the blimp read 'The World Is Mine'. If I ruled the world, imagine that. I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby. Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be. If you could be mine, we'd both shine?. If I ruled the world, still livin' for today. In these last days an' times. The way to be, paradise like relaxin' black. Latino an' Anglo-Saxon, Armani exchange the reins. Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last. Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path. The Villa house is for the crew, how we do. Trees for breakfast, dime sexes an' Benz stretches. So many years of depression make me vision. The better livin', type of place to raise kids in. Open they eyes to the lies history's told, foul. But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child. Seein' things like I was controllin', click rollin'. Trickin' six digits on kicks an' still holdin'. Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage. Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish. Political prisoner set free, stress free. No work, release purple M3's an' jet skis. Feel the wind breeze in West Indies. I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities. An' reverse themes to Willies. It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown. I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa. If I ruled the world, imagine that. I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby. Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be. If you could be mine, we'd both shine?. If I ruled the world, still livin' for today. In these last days an' times. An' then we'll walk right up to the sun. Hand in hand. We'll walk right up to the sun. We won't land. We'll walk right up to the sun. Hand in hand. We'll walk right up to the sun. We won't land. You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry. Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory. Runnin' from jake, gettin' chased, hunger for papes. These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state. Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight. Tryin' to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe. Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera. Makin' moves in Atlanta, back an' forth scrambler. 'Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich. Still nobody want a nigga havin' shit. If I ruled the world an' everythin' in it, sky's the limit. I push a Q-45 Infinit. It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies. Strictly livin' longevity to the destiny. I thought I'd never see but reality struck. Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?. If I ruled the world, imagine that. I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby. Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be. If you could be mine, we'd both shine?. If I ruled the world, still livin' for today. In these last days an' times. If I ruled the world, imagine that. I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby. Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be. If you could be mine, we'd both shine?. If I ruled the world, still livin' for today. In these last days an' times. If I ruled the world. I'd free all my sons. I love 'em, love 'em, baby. Black diamonds an' pearls. If I ruled the world. If I ruled the world. I love 'em, love 'em, babyThis is some of the lingua-fringa of da funk business,.

On a dance floor she was landing. It was clear that she was from another time. Like some baby Barbarella. With the stars as her umbrella. She asked me if I liked to magnetize. Do I have to go star-trekking. 'Cos it's you I should be checking. So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes. She's just a cosmic girl. From another galaxy. My heart's at zero gravity. She's from a cosmic world. Putting me in ecstasy. Transmitting on my frequency. She's cosmic. I'm scanning all my radars. Well she said she's from a quasar. Forty thousand million light years away. It's a distant solar system. I tried to phone but they don't list 'em. So I asked her for a number all the same. She said, step in my transporter. So I can teleport ya. All around my heavenly body. This could be a close encounter. I should take care not to flounder. Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face. She's just a cosmic girl. From another galaxy. My heart's at zero gravity.

Oh, my cosmic girl, yeah. She [Incomprehensible]Did you see the sky, I think it means that we've been lost. Maybe one less time is all we need. I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots. Jumping off a bridge, it's just the farthest that I've ever been. Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down. Anyplace, but those I know by heart. Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down. I'll follow you down, but not that far. I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come. But still, I can't remember anything. Let's not do the wrong thing and I swear it might be fun. It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone. Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down. Anyplace, but those I know by heart. Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down. I'll follow you down, but not that far. Whoooo!. How you gonna ever find your place. Runnin' in an artificial pace. Are they gonna find us lying face down in the sand. So what the hell, have we already been forever damned?. Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down. Anyplace, but those I know by heart.

You wanna live fat, all for my sack. You got more drag than a low lo-do, cut the act. 'Cause back before 92 and 93. You didn't give a damn about Warren G. But now that I'm slingin' platinum LP's. All of a sudden, you on my NUT's. Ain't nothin' you can do to make it stop. 'Cause money makes the world go 'round and the panties drop. I ain't in love though, I don't need the pressure. I just wanna dig it like I'm diggin' for treasure. Some of y'all had a good thing that you couldn't keep. Thought you was TLC, you had to creep. You say you had love, I said you bullshit. It's all about the dough, so what's love got to do with it?. What's love got to do, got to do with it?. (That's right ). What's love if you don't respect the game?. (Uh huh). What's love got to do, got to do with it?. If you lack in this game, it's a shame, you won't make it. Now, I'm the type of brother that's down for mines. Before I made beats, I was down to grind. Back then, every single homey had my back. Now they're peepin' my stack and they're talkin' 'bout Jack. But I'm the same brother day in and day out. And I'm-a stay that way until the day I lay out. In a casket it's drastic, 'cause homies is plastic. Break 'em off some bread, they want the whole damn basket. If you's a true homey, you would wish me well. Not plot to make a brother fell, jealous as hell. We used to get the same riches. Now your trigger-finger got the itches, schemin' on my riches. Which is not a suprise, my eyes peep game. 211's, 187's it's all the same. It's all a shame, homies'd jack you for your grip. Ain't no love involved, because it's all about the chips. What's love got to do, got to do with it?. (That's right ). What's love if you don't respect the game?. (Uh huh). What's love got to do, got to do with it?. (That's right). If you lack in this game, it's a shame, you won't make it. Now for these labels tellin' fables. Makin' them fucked up deals under the tables. You think that you smart, but, fool, I'm the smartest. You can't make no money if you can't keep a artist. Sign the dotted line, put 'em on the shelf. Break 'em off some crumbs, keep the rest for yourself. I know how it goes, treat a artist like you know. Fly cars, gold, clothes but no dough. Since it's all business, I'm-a handle mine. Keep track of my stack down to the very last dime. 'Cause in this rap game, it's all about the buck. You bend over for the label and you will get bucked. Like how we run up in the trick and then you're through. The record label do the same thing to you. 90 percent business, 10 percent show. Ain't no love in this game, 'cause it's all about the dough. What's love got to do, got to do with it?. (That's right). What's love if you don't respect the game?. (Uh huh). What's love got to do, got to do with it?. (That's right). If you lack in this game, it's a shame, you won't make it.

After the body bliss?. How do you turn your eyes. From the romantic glare?. How do you block the sound. Of a voice you'd know anywhere?. Oh, I really should have known. By the time you drove me home. By the vagueness in your eyes. Your casual good byes. By the chill in your embrace. The expression on your face that told me. Maybe you might have some advice to give. On how to be insensitive, insensitive, insensitive. How do you numb your skin. After the warmest touch?. How do you slow your blood. After the body rush?. How do you free your soul. After you've found a friend?. How do you teach your heart. to fall in love again?. Oh, you probably won't remember me. It's probably ancient history. I'm one of the chosen few. Who went ahead and fell for you. I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch. I fell too fast, I feel too much. I thought that you might have some advice to give. On how to be insensitive. Oh, I really should have known. By the time you drove me home. By the vagueness in your eyes. Your casual good byes. By the chill in your embrace. The expression on your face that told me. Maybe you might have some advice to give. On how to be, insensitive. How to be. Insensitive. How to be. Insensitive. How to beAll my little plans and schemes. Lost like some forgotten dreams. Seems that all I really was doing. Was waiting for you. Just like little girls and boys. Playing with their little toys. Seems like all they really were doing. Was waiting for love. Don't need to be alone. No need to be alone. It's real love, it's real. Yes it's real love, it's real. From this moment on I know. Exactly where my life will go. Seems that all I really was doing. Was waiting for love. Don't need to be afraid. No need to be afraid. It's real love, it's real. Yes it's real love, it's real. Thought I'd been in love before. But in my heart, I wanted more. Seems like all I really was doing. Was waiting for you. Don't need to be alone. Don't need to be alone. It's real love, yes it's real. It's real love, it's real. Yes it's real love, it's real. It's real love, it's real. Yes it's real love, it's real. It's real love, it's real. Yes it's real love, it's real. It's real love, it's real. Yes it's real love, it's realI've been watchin' you from afar. For as long as I can remember. You are all a real man can need. And ever ask for, this is love. This is more than a crush. It was all up at Rutgers, I saw with your man. Smiling, a coach bag in your hand. I was layin' in the coup with my hat turned back. We caught eyes for a moment and that was that. So skated off as you strolled off. Looking at them legs, god damn they looked so soft. I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission. If his love is real he got ta handle competition. You only knew about 5 months. Besides he drinks too much and smokes too many blunts. And I've been workin' out everyday thinkin' 'bout you. Lookin' at my own eyes in the rear view. Catchin' flash backs of our eye contact. Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back. I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears. I can't believe it, I had a crush in years. Hey lover. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday. Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way. And I don't want ta violate your relationship. So I lay back in the cut with a crush that'a trip. Still he can't stop me from having day dreams. Tonging you down with  vanilla ice cream. Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight. Searching your body with my tounge girl all night. I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams can turn into reality. Our love would come down so naturally. We would walk down the isle of destiny. What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared. Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair. That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs. But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead. Hey lover. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Last week I saw ya at the mall. Standing at the pay phone 'bout to make a call. I had a vision, it was me on the other end. Telling you come by and then you walked in. I touched you gently with my hands. We talked about travellin' the distant lands. Escaping all the madness out here in the world. Becomin' my wife no longer my girl. Then you let your dress fall down to the floor. I kissed you softly and you yearned for more. We experienced pleasure unparallel. Into a ocean of love we both fell. Swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss. Fantasies interchanging with each kiss. Undying passion unites our souls. Together we swim until the point of no control. But its a fantasy, you won't come true. We never even spoke and your man still love you. So I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside. Keep my dreams alive until the right time. Hey, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush. This is more than a crush. This is more than a crush. This is more than a crush. This is more than a crushA long December and there's reason to believe. Maybe this year will be better than the last. I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving. Oh the days go by so fast. . And it's one more day up in the Canyons. And it's one more night in Hollywood. If you think that I could be forgiven. I wish you would. Na na na, yeah. . The smell of hospitals in winter. And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls. All at once you look across a crowded room. To see the way that light attaches to a girl. . And it's one more day up in the Canyons. And it's one more night in Hollywood. If you think you might come to California. I think you should. Na na na, yeah. . Drove up to hillside manor sometime after 2 A.M. And talked a little while about the year. I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower. Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her. . And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe. Maybe this year will be better than the last. I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself. To hold on to these moments as they pass. . And it's one more day up in the Canyon. And it's one more night in Hollywood. It's been so long since I've seen the ocean. I guess I should. Na na na, yeah. Na na na, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Na na na, yeah.

Though I never knew you at all. You had the grace to hold yourself. While those around you crawled. They crawled out of the woodwork. And they whispered into your brain. They set you on the treadmill. And they made you change your name. And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in. And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid. Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did. Loneliness was tough. The toughest role you ever played. Hollywood created a superstar. And pain was the price you paid. Even when you died. All the press still hounded you. All the papers had to say. Was that Marilyn was found in the nude. And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in. And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid. Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did. Goodbye, Norma Jean. Though I never knew you at all. You had the grace to hold yourself. While those around you crawled. Goodbye, Norma Jean.

And I am taken to a place, where your crystal mind and. Magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine. Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola. I don't need to try to explain, I just hold on tight. And if it happens again, I might move so slightly. To the arms and the lips. And the face of the human cannonball. That I need to, I want to. Come stand, a little bit closer. Breathe in and get a bit higher. You'll never know what hit you. When I get to you. Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you. But, oh, I'd die to find out. Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you. But, oh I gotta to find out. I'm the kind of person, who endorses a deep commitment. Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for. But a look, and then a smell of perfume. It's like, I'm down on the floor. And I don't know what I'm in for. Conversation has a time and place. In the interaction of a lover and a mate. But the time of talking, using symbols, using words. Can be likened to a deep sea diver. Who is swimming with a raincoat. Come stand, a little bit closer. Breathe in and get a bit higher. You'll never know what hit you. When I get to you. Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you. But, oh, I'd die to find out. Oh, I want you, I don't know if I need you. But, oh I gotta to find out. Anytime, I need to see your face I just close my eyes. And I am taken to a place where your crystal mind and. Magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine. Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola. I don't need to try to explain, I just hold on tight. And if it happens again, I might move so slightly. To the arms and the lips. And the face of the human cannonball. That I need to, I want to. Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you. But, oh, I'd die to find out. Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you. But, oh I gotta to find out. So can we find out?. Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you. But, oh, I gotta to find out. Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you. But, oh I gotta to find out. Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you. But, oh, I gotta to find out. Oh, I want you I don't know if I need you. But, oh I gotta to find outI hate the world today. You're so good to me. I know but I can't change. Tried to tell you. But you look at me like maybe. I'm an angel underneath. Innocent and sweet. Yesterday I cried. You must have been relieved to see. The softer side. I can understand. How you'd be so confused. I don't envy you. I'm a little bit of everything. All rolled into one. I'm a bitch, I'm a lover. I'm a child, I'm a mother. I'm a sinner, I'm a saint. I do not feel ashamed. I'm your hell, I'm your dream. I'm nothing in between. You know you wouldn't want it. Any other way. So take me as I am, this may mean. You'll have to be a stronger man. Rest assured that. When I start to make you nervous. And I'm going to extremes. Tomorrow I will change. And today won't mean a thing. I'm a bitch, I'm a lover. I'm a child, I'm a mother. I'm a sinner, I'm a saint. I do not feel ashamed. I'm your hell, I'm your dream. I'm nothing in between. You know you wouldn't want it. Any other way. Just when you think, you got me figured out. The season's already changing. I think it's cool, you do what you do. And don't try to save me. I'm a bitch, I'm a lover. I'm a child, I'm a mother. I'm a sinner, I'm a saint. I do not feel ashamed. I'm your hell, I'm your dream. I'm nothing in between. You know you wouldn't want it. Any other way. I'm a bitch, I'm a tease. I'm a goddess on my knees. When you hurt, when you suffer. I'm your angel undercover. I've been numb, I'm revived. Can't say I'm not alive. You know I wouldn't want it. Any other wayMadonna. Evita. Don't Cry For Me Argentina. (Eva:). It won't be easy, you'll think it strange. When I try to explain how I feel. That I still need your love after all that I've done. . You won't believe me. All you will see is a girl you once knew. Although she's dressed up to the nines. At sixes and sevens with you. . I had to let it happen, I had to change. Couldn't stay all my life down at heel. Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun. . So I chose freedom. Running around, trying everything new. But nothing impressed me at all. I never expected it to. . Chorus:. . Don't cry for me Argentina. The truth is I never left you. All through my wild days. My mad existence. I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance. . And as for fortune, and as for fame. I never invited them in. Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired. . They are illusions. They are not the solutions they promised to be. The answer was here all the time. I love you and hope you love me. . Don't cry for me Argentina. . (chorus). . Have I said too much?. There's nothing more I can think of to say to you.. But all you have to do is look at me to know. That every word is trueJust tell me what you've got to say to me. I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth. It comes as no surprise at all you see. So cut the crap and tell me that we're through. Now I know your heart, I know your mind. You don't even know you're bein' unkind. So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways. Just use me up and then you walk away. Boy, you can't play me that way. Well I guess what you say is true. I could never be the right kind of girl for you. I could never be your woman. I could never be your woman. I could never be your woman. I could never be your woman. When I saw my best friend yesterday. She said she never liked you from the start. Well me, I wish that I could claim the same. But you always knew you held my heart. And you're such a charming, handsome man. Now I think I finally understand. Is it in your genes? I don't know. But I'll soon find out, that's for sure. Why did you play me this way?. Well I guess what you say is true. I could never be the right kind of girl for you. I could never be your woman. I could never be your woman. I could never be your woman. I could never be your woman. Well I guess what they say is true. I could never spend my life with a man like you. I could never be your woman. I could never be your woman. I could never be your woman. I could never be your woman[** duet with Akon:]. . [Akon:]. Konvict music (oh yeah). [Michael:]. Yeah.

Leave the one I'm with. Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do. Think about a ring and all the things that come along with. You make me, you make me. Before anything became between us. You were like my best friend. The one I used to run and talk to. When me and my girl was having problems. You used to say it would be okay. Suggest little nice things I should do. And when I go home at night and lay my head down. All I seem to think about was you. And how you make me wanna leave the one I'm with. Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do. Think about a ring and all the things that come along with. You make me, you make me. Leave the one I'm with. Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do. Think about a ring and all the things that come along with. You make me, you make me. Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up. Knowing it should have been you. And what's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you. What should I do, should I tell my baby bye-bye. Should I do exactly what I feel inside. 'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay. But I really need to get it together. You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to. Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do.

Think about a ring and all the things that come along with. You make me, you make me. At this point the situation's out of control. I never meant to hurt her but I gotta let her go. And she may not understand it why all of this is going on. I tried, I tried to fight but the feeling's just too strong. You make me wanna. You make me wanna. You make me wanna. You make me wanna.

The sun in the sky never raised an eye to me. The blood on the tracks and must be mine. The fool on the hill and I feel fine. Don't look back 'cause you know what you might see. Look into the wall of my mind's eye. I think I know, but I don't know why. The questions are the answers you might need. Coming in a mess going out in style. I ain't good looking but I'm someone's child. No one can give me the air that's mine to breathe. I met my maker, I made him cry. And on my shoulder he asked me why. His people won't fly through the storm. I said "Hey listen up man, they don't even know you're born". All my people right here, right now. D'you know what I mean? Yeah yeah. All my people right here, right now. D'you know what I mean? Yeah yeah. All my people right here, right now. D'you know what I mean? Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah, yeah yeah. I don't really care for what you believe. So open up your fist or you won't receive. The thoughts and the words of every man you'll need. Get up off the floor and believe in life. No one's ever gonna ever ask you twice. Get on the bus and bring it on home to me. I met my maker, I made him cry. And on my shoulder he asked me why. His people won't fly through the storm. I said "Listen up man, they don't even know you're born". All my people right here, right now. D'you know what I mean? Yeah yeah. All my people right here, right now. D'you know what I mean? Yeah yeah. All my people right here, right now. D'you know what I mean? Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah. All my people right here, right now. D'you know what I mean? Yeah yeah. All my people right here, right now. D'you know what I mean? Yeah yeah. All my people right here, right now. D'you know what I mean? Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeahI finally found someone. That knocks me off my feet. I finally found the one. That makes me feel complete. It started over coffee. We started out as friends. It's funny how from simple things. The best things begin. This time it's different. Ta ra ra ra. It's all because of you. Ta ra ra ra. It's better than it's ever been. 'Cause we can talk it through. My favorite line was. Can I call you sometime?. It's all you had to say. To take my breath away. This is it, oh, I finally found someone. Someone to share my life. I finally found the one. To be with every night. 'Cause whatever I do. It's just got to be you. My life has just begun. I finally found someone. Someone. I finally found someone. Did I keep you waiting?. I didn't mind. I apologize. Baby, that's fine. I would wait forever just to know. You were mine. You know, I love your hair. Are you sure it looks right. I love what you wear. Isn't it too tight?. You're exceptional. I can't wait for the rest of my life. This is it, oh, I finally found someone. Someone to share my life. I finally found the one. To be with every night. 'Cause whatever I do. It's just got to be you, oh yeah. My life has just begun. I finally found someone. And whatever I do. It's just got to be you. My life has just begun. I finally found someoneNow I've seen places and faces and things. You ain't never thought about thinking. If you ain't peek then you must be drinking and smokin'. Pretending not to lookin' but you're brokin' let me get you open. Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life. And Tamika around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe. The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money. And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny. But who's the dummy 'cos, now you done lost the hustler. A down-ass brother got replaced by a buster. And though I got love for ya I know I can't trust ya. 'Cos my crew is rollin' hummers and your crew is rollin' dust's. And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more. I guess that's just the way it goes I ain't trying preach. I believe I can reach but your mind ain't prepared. I'll see you when you get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. More temptation and faith I guess we livin' for the day. I seen a man get swept off his feet by a boy with an AK. The situation so twisted everybody getting lifted. I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business. 'Cos it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention. So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin'. Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big horse. Someone's gotta run a little faster 'cos we gotta lay the struggle. I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender. And if everybody's a sinner then everybody could be a winner. No matter you rag collar deep down we all brothers. And regardless of the time somebody up there still love us. I'm a scuff and struggle and y'all I'm breathless and weak. I just strive my whole life to make it to the mountain peak. Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something. I'll be there when you get there when you wit the sound bumpin'. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. You need to loosen up and live a little. And if you got kids let them know how you feelin'. For your own sake give a little. Oh, you don't want to hear that you busy trying stack. And keep them from the Jones's is taking advantage of your own. The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest. But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone. Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us. We prefer to keep our eyes shut to describe when. It's something wrong and we desire. So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous. I know time seems right and the problems seem endless. But at times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together. And if you fell you're out the game then you need to get back in it. 'Cos nothing worse than a quitter. You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother. So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition. And put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. See you when you get there. As we walk down the road of our destiny. And the time comes to choose which shall it be. The wide and crooked, or the straight barrel. We got one voice to give and one life to live. Stand up for something or lie down in your game. Listen to the song that we sing. It's up to you to make it big. I guess I'll see you when you see me. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get there. I'll see you when you get there. If you ever get thereDo-do-do, do-do-do-doo. Do-do-do, do-do-do-doo. Do-do-do, do-do-do-doo. Do-do-do. I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling. She's living, she's golden, she lives for me. Says she lives for me. Ovation, her own motivation. She comes 'round and she goes down on me. And I make her smile like a drug for you. Do ever what you want to do, coming over you. Keep on smiling what we go through. One stop to the rhythm that divides you. And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse. Chop another line like a coda with a curse. Come on like a freak show, takes the stage. We give them the games we play, she said. I want something else. To get me through this. Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby. I want something else. I'm not listening when you say. Goodbye. Do-do-do, do-do-do-doo. Do-do-do, do-do-do-doo. Do-do-do, do-do-do-doo. Do-do-do. The sky was gold, it was rose. I was taking sips of it through my nose. And I wish it could get back there, some place back there. Smiling in the pictures you would take. Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break. It won't stop, I won't come down. I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop. And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given. Then I bumped again, then I bumped again. Said how do I get back there. To the place where I fell asleep inside you?. How do I get myself back to the place. Where you said?. I want something else. To get me through this. Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby. I want something else. I'm not listening when you say. Goodbye. I believe in the sand beneath my toes. The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling. I believe in the faith that grows. And the four right chords can make me cry. When I'm with you I feel like I could die. And that would be all right, all right. And when the plane came in. She said she was crashing. The velvet it rips in the city. We tripped on the urge to feel alive. But now I'm struggling to survive. Those days you were wearing that velvet dress. You're the priestess I must confess. Those little red panties, they pass the test. Slide up around the belly face. Down on the mattress one. And you hold me and we are broken. Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now. Feel myself head made of the ground. I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no. And I won't run for my life. She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile. But nothing is all right, all right. And I want something else. To get me through this life baby. I want something else. Not listening when you say. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. Do-do-do, do-do-do-doo. Do-do-do, do-do-do-doo. Do-do-do, do-do-do-doo. The sky was gold, it was rose. I was taking sips of it through my nose. And I wish it could get back there, some place back there. In the place we used to start. Do-do-do, do-do-do-doo. Do-do-do, do-do-do-doo.   (I want something else). Do-do-do, do-do-do-dooYou took your coat off and stood in the rain,. You're always crazy like that.. And I watched from my window,. Always felt I was outside looking in on you.. You're always the mysterious one with. Dark eyes and careless hair,. You were fashionably sensitive. But too cool to care.. You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say. Besides some comment on the weather.. Well in case you failed to notice,. In case you failed to see,. This is my heart bleeding before you,. This is me down on my knees, and.... These foolish games are tearing me apart,. And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart.. You're breaking my heart.. You're always brilliant in the morning,. Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee.. Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you.. You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones. As I clumsily strummed my guitar.. You'd teach me of honest things,. Things that were daring, things that were clean.. Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.. I hid my soiled hands behind my back.. Somewhere along the line, I must have gone. Off track with you.. Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else,. Somebody who gave a damn,. Somebody more like myself.. These foolish games are tearing me,. You're tearing me,. You're tearing me apart,. And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart.. You're breaking my heart.. You took your coat off,. Stood in the rain,. You're always crazy like that.When I was young. I never needed anyone. And making love was just for fun. Those days are gone. Livin' alone. I think of all the friends I've known. When I dial the telephone. Nobody's home. All by myself. Don't wanna be. All by myself. Anymore. Hard to be sure. Sometimes I feel so insecure. And loves so distant and obscure. Remains the cure. All by myself. Don't wanna be. All by myself. Anymore. All by myself. Don't wanna live. All by myself. Anymore. When I was young. I never needed anyone. Making love was just for fun. Those days are gone. All by myself. Don't wanna be. All by myself. Anymore. All by myself. Don't wanna live. Oh. Don't wanna live. By myself, by myself. Anymore. By myself. Anymore. Oh. All by myself. Don't wanna live. I never, never, never. Needed anyoneEverybody needs a little time away. I heard her say, from each other. Even lovers need a holiday. Far away from each other. Hold me now. It's hard for me to say, I'm sorry. I just want you to stay. And after all that you've been through. I will make it up to you, I promise you baby. And after all that's been said and done. You're just a part of me I can't let go. Couldn't stand to be kept away. Not for a day, from your body. Baby, I can't live without you, not even day. Wouldn't wanna be swept away. Far away from the one that I love. Hold me now. It's hard for me to say, I'm sorry. I just want you to know. Hold me now.

Oh I will come to youI hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man. He said he'd been down this road more than twice. He was high on intellectualism. I've never been there but the brochure looks nice. Jump in, let's go. Lay back, enjoy the show. Everybody gets high, everybody gets low. These are the days when anything goes. Everyday is a winding road. I get a little bit closer. Everyday is a faded sign. I get a little bit closer to feeling fine. He's got a daughter he calls Easter. She was born on a Tuesday night. I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone. Why I'm a stranger in my own life. Jump in, let's go. Lay back, enjoy the show. Everybody gets high, everybody gets low. These are the days when anything goes. Everyday is a winding road. I get a little bit closer. Everyday is a faded sign, oh yeah. I get a little bit closer. Everyday is a winding road. I get a little bit closer. Everyday is a faded sign, oh oh yeah. I get a little bit closer to feeling fine. I've been living on a sea of anarchy. I've been living on coffee and nicotine. I've been wondering if all the thing I've seen. Were ever real, were ever really happening. Everyday is a winding road. I get a little bit closer. Everyday is a faded sign, oh yeah. I get a little bit closer. Everyday is a winding road. I get a little bit closer. Everyday is a faded sign. I get a little bit closer to feeling fine. Hey feeling fine, oh feeling fine. Oh yeahWooooo hoooo!. Wooooo hoooo!. Wooooo hoooo!. Wooooo hoooo!. I got my head checked. By a jumbo jet. It wasn't easy. but nothing i-is. No. Wooooo hooooooo!. When I feel heavy metal. Wooooo hooooooo!. And I feels that i made all. Wooooo hooooooo!. Well, I lie and I'm easy. All of the time but I am never sure. Why I need you. Pleased to meet you. I got my head down. When I was young. It's not my problem. It's not my problem. Wooooo hooooooo!. When I feel heavy metal. Wooooo hooooooo!. And I feels that i made all. Wooooo hooooooo!. Well, I lie and I'm easy. All of the time but I am never sure. Why I need you. Pleased to meet you. Yeah yeah!...She used to be my enemy and never let me be free. Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be. Every other day I crossed the line, I didn't mean to be so bad. I never thought you would become the friend I never had. Back then I didn't know why. Why you were misunderstood. So now I see through your eyes. All that you did was love. Mama, I love you, Mama, I care. Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend. You're my friend. I didn't want to hear it then but, I'm not ashamed to say it now. Every little thing you said and did was right for me. I had a lot of time to think about, about the way I used to be. Never had a sense of my responsibility. Back then I didn't know why. Why you were misunderstood. So now I see through your eyes. All that you did was love. Mama, I love you, Mama, I care. Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend. You're my friend, you're my friend. But now I'm sure I know why. Why you were misunderstood. So now I see through your eyes. All I can give you is love. Mama, I love you, Mama, I care. Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend. Mama, I love you, Mama, I care. Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend. You're my friend, you're my friend. Ohh, my Mama my love. Ohh, my Mama my love. In love in you, in love in me. And love is true and guaranteed. ...Summer stretching on the grass. Summer dresses pass. In the shade of a willow tree. Creeps a crawling over me. Over me and over you, stuck together with God's glue. It's going to get stickier too. It's been a long hot summer, let's get undercover. Don't try too hard to think, don't think at all. You're not the only one, staring at the sun. Afraid of what you'd find, if you stepped back inside. Not just deaf and dumb, staring at the sun. Not the only one, who's happy to go blind. There's an insect in your ear. If you scratch it won't disappear. It's going to itch and burn and sting. You want to see what the scratching brings. Waves that leave me out of reach. Breaking on your back like a beach. Will we ever live in peace? 'Cause those that can't do, often have to. No those that can't do, often have to preach. To the one, staring at the sun. Afraid of what you'd find, if you stepped back inside. Not just deaf and dumb, staring at the sun. I'm not the only one, who's happy to go blind. Intransigence is all around. Military still in town. Armour plated suits and ties. Daddy just won't say goodbye. Referee won't blow the whistle, God is good, but will He listen?. I'm nearly great, but there's something missing. I left it in the duty free, oh superb. You never really belonged to me. You're not the only one, staring at the sun. Afraid of what you'd find, if you stepped back inside. I'm not sucking on my thumb, staring at the sun. I'm not the only one, who's happy to go blind. Happy to go blind, happy to go blind, happy to go blind. I'm happy to go, happy to go, happy to go blind. Happy to go blind, happy to go blind. I'm happy to go, happy to go, happy to go blindOh yea oh oh oh. I long for the warmth of days gone by when you were mine. But now those days are memories in time. Life's empty without you by my side. My heart belongs to you. No matter what I try. When I get the courage up to love somebody new. It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you. Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain. Reminiscing our love as I watch 4 seasons change. In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow. And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe. When springtime makes it's way here. Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume. When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you. Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do. When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare. When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same. Remember the nights when we closed our eyes. And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time. Anytime I think about these things I shared with you. I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional. Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain. Reminiscing our love as I watch 4 seasons change. In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow. And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe. When springtime makes it's way here. Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume. When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you. Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do. When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare. When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same. This loneliness has crushed my heart. Please let me love again. 'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain. Or 4 seasons will bring the loneliness again. In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow. And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe. When springtime makes it's way here. Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume. When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you. Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do. When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare. When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same. Remember the warmth of days gone byShe's taking her time making up the reasons. To justify all the hurt inside. Guess she knows from the smiles. And the look in their eyes. Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one. They're saying. Mama never loved her much. And daddy never keeps in touch. That's why she shies away from human affection. But somewhere in a private place. She packs her bags for outer space. And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come. (and she'll say to him). She's saying. I would fly to the moon and back. If you'll be, if you'll be my baby. Got a ticket for a world where we belong. So would you be my baby?. Ooh-ooh. She can't remember a time when she felt needed. If love was red then she was color-blind. All her friends they've been tried for treason. And crimes that were never defined. She's saying. Love is like a barren place. And reaching out for human faith. Is like a journey I just don't have a map for. So baby gonna take a dive and. push the shift to overdrive. Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars. (What a pleasant dream). Just saying. I would fly to the moon and back. If you'll be, if you'll be my baby. Got a ticket for a world where we belong. So would you be my baby?. Mama never loved her much. And daddy never keeps in touch. That's why she shies away from human affection. But somewhere in a private place. She packs her bags for outer space. And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come. (And she'll say to him). She's saying. I would fly to the moon and back. If you'll be, if you'll be my baby. Got a ticket for a world where we belong. So would you be my baby?. yeahOh you get me ready in your 56 Chevy. Why don't we go sit down in the shade?. Take shelter on my front porch. The dandy lion sun scorching. Like a glass of cold lemonade?. I will do laundry if you pay all the bills. Where is my John Wayne?. Where is my prairie son?. Where is my happy ending?. Where have all the Cowboys gone?. Why don't you stay the evening. Kick back and watch the TV. And I'll fix a little somethin' to eat?. Oh I know your back hurts from working on the tractor. How do you take your coffee my sweet?. I will raise the children if you pay all the bills?. Where is my John Wayne?. Where is my prairie son?. Where is my happy ending?. Where have all the Cowboys gone?. I am wearing my new dress tonight. But you don't even notice me. Say our goodbyes.

But I was alone. I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind. I remember how your body started trembling. Oh, what a night it's been and for the state I'm in. I'm still alone. And all the wonders made for the earth. And all the hearts in all creation. Somehow I always end up alone. Always end up alone, always end up alone. So I play, I'll wait. 'Cause you know that love takes time. We came so far. Just the beat of a lonely heart. And it's mine. And I don't want to be alone. Since I got no message on your answer phone. Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home. I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere. But I'm still alone. I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate. 'Cause I know it isn't Heaven, is it love or hate?. Am I the subject of the pain and I the stranger in the rain?. I am alone. And if there glory there to behold. Maybe it's my imagination. Another story there to be told. So I play, I'll wait. And I pray it's not too late. We came so far. Just a beat of a lonely heart. And it's mine. And I don't want to be alone.

Just a beat of a lonely heart. And it's mine. And I don't want to be alone. Gone but not out of sight. I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home. Face the heat of the night.

And tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me. I keep away from fools . They do crime and it attracts cops. Cops got guns and cuffs. And cells to stuff you in. [Repeat Chorus:]. [Verse 2:]. They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do. You know who. The boys in blue. There they go with they assumpitons. Slaverys over let us have somethin'. Why you wanna pull me over?. Cuz I'm bumpin?. I just made a new song. My profession is music. Your profession is protection with gats. Then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away. I'm just tryin' to live my life today. So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops. Cops got guns and cuffs. And cells to stuff you in. [Repeat Chorus:]. [Verse 3:]. I shot the sheriff. I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to. Cuz in this game they always tryin' to blast you. And leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder. They harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man. The hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay. Cuz I'm gonna work for life. So he can see another day. A hommies a hommie. A fake is a snake. Straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake. So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops. Cops got guns and cuffs. And cells to stuff you inDon't it always seem to go.

Trying to hold on to that was just impossible. She was more than beautiful, closer to ethereal. With a kind of down to earth flavor. Close my eyes, it's three in the afternoon. Then I, I realize that she's really gone for good. Anybody seen my baby. Anybody seen her around. Love has gone and made me blind. I've looked but I just can't find. She has got lost in the crowd. And I was flippin' magazines. In that place on Mercer Street. When I thought I spotted her. And getting on a motor bike. Looking really lady like. Didn't she just give me a wave?. The salty tears, it's three in the afternoon. Has she disappeared, has she really gone for good. Anybody seen my baby. Anybody seen her around. If I just as close my eyes. I reach out and touch the prize. Anybody seen her around. Oh yeah, that's a loosener. Anybody seen my baby. Has anybody seen her, anybody seen her around. If I could just as close my eyes. I will reach out, reach out and touch the prize. Anybody seen her around. Anybody seen my baby. Anybody seen her around. Lost, lost and never found. I must have called her a thousand times. Oh, sometimes I just think. She's just in my imagination. Lost, lost in the crowdAerosmith. Nine Lives. Falling In Love (Is Hard On The Knees). (Tyler, Perry, Ballard) . .

Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease. As I listened through the cemetery trees. I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn. The long broken arm of human law. Now it always seemed such a waste. She always had a pretty face. I wondered why she hung around this place. Hey, come on try a little, nothing is forever. There's got to be something better than in the middle. But me and Cinderella we put it all together. We can drive it home with one headlight. She said it's cold, it feels like Independence Day. And I can't break away from this parade. But there's got to be an opening. Somewhere here in front of me. Through this maze of ugliness and greed. And I seen the sign up ahead at the county line bridge. Saying all is good and nothingness is dead. Run until she's out of breath. She ran until there's nothing left. She hit the end, it's just her window ledge. Hey, come on try a little, nothing is forever. There's got to be something better than in the middle. But me and Cinderella we put it all together. We can drive it home with one headlight. Well this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck. I turn the engine but the engine doesn't turn. Well it smells of cheap wine and cigarettes. This place is always such a mess. Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn. I'm so alone and I feel just like somebody else. Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same. But somewhere here in between. These city walls of dying dreams. I think her death it must be killing me. Hey, hey, hey! Come on try a little, nothing is forever. There's got to be something better than in the middle. But me and Cinderella we put it all together. We can drive it home with one headlightI'm just a bachelor. I'm looking for a partner.

Destination Anywhere. Midnight In Chelsea. J. Bon Jovi, Dave Stewart . . The kids 'round here look just like sticks . They trade old licks with a beat up six . I just smile and catch the groove . . Gothic girls all dress in black . Serious as heart attacks . It takes a little bit of getting used to . . The old man with the whiskey stains . Lost the night forgot his name . His poor wife will sleep alone again . And it ain't hard to understand . Why she's holding on to her own hand . . Chorus: . It's midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea . No one's asking me for favors . No one's looking for a savoir . They're too busy saving me . . (Repeat Chorus) . . I've seen a lone,sloane ranger drive . seems her chauffeur took a dive . And sold her secrets to the sun . And later in a magazine . I finally figured what it means . To be a saint, not a queen . . Two lustful lovers catch a spark . And chase their shadows in the dark . Someone's getting off tonight . Of a big red bus that's packed so tight . It disappears in a trail of light . Somewhere someone's dreaming baby it's all right... . . Chorus: . It's midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea . No one's asking me for favors . No one's looking for a savoir . They're too busy saving me . Midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea . No one's pinned dreams on me . No one's asking me to bleed . I'm the man I want to be . When Chelsea girls sing... . . It's morning when I go to sleep . In the distant dawn a church bell rings . Another day is coming on . A baby's born, an old man dies . Somewhere young lovers kiss good-bye . I leave my soul and just move on . And wish that I was there to sing this song . . Chorus: . It's midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea . No one's asking me for favors . No one's looking for a savoir . They're too busy saving me . . It's midnight in Chelsea, midnight in Chelsea . No one's pinned dreams on me . No one's asking me to bleed . I'm the man I want to be . The man I want to be,the man I want to be . Midnight in ChelseaBruce Springsteen. Greatest Hits. Secret Garden.

You're frozen when your heart's not open. You're so consumed with how much you get. You waste your time with hate and regret. You're broken when your heart's not open. Mmm, mmm, if I could melt your heart. Mmm, mmm, we'd never be apart. Mmm, mmm, give yourself to me. Mmm, mmm, you hold the key. Now there's no point in placing the blame. And you should know I suffer the same. If I lose you my heart will be broken. Love is a bird, she needs to fly. Let all the hurt inside of you die. You're frozen when your heart's not open. Mmm, mmm, if I could melt your heart. Mmm, mmm, we'd never be apart. Mmm, mmm, give yourself to me. Mmm, mmm, you hold the key. You only see what your eyes want to see. How can life be what you want it to be. You're frozen when your heart's not open. Mmm, mmm, if I could melt your heart. Mmm, mmm, we'd never be apart. Mmm, mmm, give yourself to me. Mmm, mmm, you hold the key. Mmm, mmm, if I could melt your heart. Mmm, mmm, we'd never be apart. Mmm, mmm, give yourself to me. Mmm, mmm, you hold the key. If I could melt your heartI thought, I saw a man brought to life. He was warm, he came around and he was dignified. He showed me what it was to cry. Well, you couldn't be that man I adored. You don't seem to know. Seem to care what your heart is for. But I don't know him anymore. There's nothing where he used to lie. The conversation has run dry. That's what's going on. Nothing's fine, I'm torn. I'm all out of faith. This is how I feel. I'm cold and I am shamed. Lying naked on the floor. Illusion never changed. Into something real. I'm wide awake and I can see. The perfect sky is torn. You're a little late, I'm already torn. So I guess the fortune teller's right. Should have seen just what was there. And not some holy light. It crawled beneath my veins. And now I don't care, I had no luck. I don't miss it all that much. There's just so many things. That I can touch, I'm torn. I'm all out of faith. This is how I feel. I'm cold and I am shamed. Lying naked on the floor. Illusion never changed. Into something real. I'm wide awake and I can see. The perfect sky is torn. You're a little late, I'm already torn, torn. There's nothing where he used to lie. My inspiration has run dry. That's what's going on. Nothing's right, I'm torn. I'm all out of faith. This is how I feel. I'm cold and I am shamed. Lying naked on this floor. Illusion never changed. Into something real. I'm wide awake and I can see. The perfect sky is torn. I'm all out of faith. This is how I feel. I'm cold and I'm ashamed. Bound and broken on the floor. You're a little late, I'm already torn, tornAnd i'd give up forever to touch you. 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow. You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be. And I don't want to go home right now. And all I can taste is this moment. And all I can breathe is your life. 'Cause sooner or later it's over. I just don't want to miss you tonight. And I don't want the world to see me. 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken. I just want you to know who I am. And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming. Or the moment of truth in your lies. When everything feels like the movies. Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive. And I don't want the world to see me. 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand. When everything's made to be broken. I just want you to know who I am. And I don't want the world to see me.

Was it that I never paid enough attention?. Or did I not give enough affection?. Not only will your answers keep me sane. But I'll know never to make the same mistake again. You can tell me to my face. Or even on the phone. You can write it in a letter. Either way I've have to know. Did I never treat you right?. Did I always start the fight?. Either way I'm going out of my mind. All the answers to my questions I have to find. My head's spinning boy, I'm in a daze. I feel isolated, don't wanna communicate. I take a shower, I will scour, I will roam. Find peace of mind, the happy mind I once owned, yeah. Flexing vocabulary runs right through me. The alphabet runs right from A to Z. Conversations, hesitations in my mind. You got my conscience asking questions that I can't find. I'm not crazy,  I'm sure I ain't done nothin' wrong, no. I'm just waiting 'cos I heard that this feeling won't last that long. Never ever have I ever felt so low. When you gonna take me out of this black hole. Never ever have I ever felt so sad. The way I'm feeling yeah, you got me feeling really bad. Never ever have I had to find. I've had to dig a way to find my own piece of mind. I've never ever had my conscience to fight.

Need to be free from pain. Go insane. My heart aches, yeah. Sometimes vocabulary runs through my head. The alphabet runs right from A to Z. Conversations, hesitations in my mind. You got my concience asking questions that I can't find. I'm not crazy. I'm sure I ain't done nothing wrong. Now I'm just awaiting. 'Cos I heard that this feeling won't last that long.

We mighta took the long way. We knew we'd get there someday. They said, "I bet they'll never make it". But just look at us holding on. We're still together still going strong. (You're still the one). You're still the one I run to. The one that I belong to. You're still the one I want for life. (You're still the one). You're still the one that I love. The only one I dream of. You're still the one I kiss good night. Ain't nothin' better. We beat the odds together. I'm glad we didn't listen. Look at what we would be missin'. They said, "I bet they'll never make it". But just look at us holding on. We're still together still going strong. (You're still the one). You're still the one I run to. The one that I belong to. You're still the one I want for life.

You're still the one I kiss good nightYo, remember back on the boogie when cats used to harmonize like. Yo, my men and my women. Don't forget about the deen, Sirat al-Mustaqeem. Yo, it's about a thing. If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air. And lick two shots in the atmosphere!. It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend. The one you let hit it and never called you again. 'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?. You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim. To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend. Like you wasn't down and you called him again?. Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him. If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again. Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian. A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn. Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in. Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?. Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend. Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again. You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine. Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem. Baby girl, respect is just a minimum. Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em. Now, Lauryn is only human. Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament. Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn. It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in. Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans. Fake nails done by Koreans. Come again. Guys you know you'd better watch out. Some girls, some girls are only about. That thing, that thing, that thing. That thing, that thing, that thing. The second verse is dedicated to the men. More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women. Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans. Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!). Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men. Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement. The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men. Need to take care of they three or four kids. And they face a court case when the child support late. Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men. The sneaky, silent men. The punk, domestic violence men. Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men. How you gonna win when you ain't right within?. How you gonna win when you ain't right within?. How you gonna win when you ain't right within?. Come again. Watch out, watch out. Look out, look out. Girls you know you'd better watch out. Some guys, some guys are only about. That thing, that thing, that thing. That thing, that thing, that thing. Guys you know you'd better watch out. Some girls, some girls are only about. That thing, that thing, that thing. That thing, that thing, that thing. Girls you know you'd better watch out. Some guys, some guys are only about. That thing, that thing, that thing. That thing, that thing, that thingAhh crush ahh. See you blowin' me a kiss it doesn't take a scientist. To understand whats goin' on baby. If you see somethin' in my eye, let's not over analyze. Don't go too deep with it baby. So let it be, what it'll be. Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me. Here's what I do, I'll play the wuss. Not like we have a date with destiny. It's just a little crush. Not like I faint, every time we touch. It's just some little thing. Not like every thing I do, depends on you. Sha la la la, sha la la la. It's raisin' my adrenalin', you're bangin' on a heart of tin. Please don't make too much of it, baby. Say, "That were for ever more". That's not what I'm lookin' for all I can commit to is maybe. So let it be, what it'll be. Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me. Here's what I do, I'll play the wuss. Not like we have a date with destiny. It's just a little crush. Not like I faint, every time we touch. It's just some little thing. Not like every thing I do, depends on you. Sha la la la, sha la la la. Vanilla skies. White picket fences in your eyes. A vision of you and me. It's just a little crush. Not like I faint, every time we touch. It's just some little thing. Not like every thing, I do depends on you. Sha la la la, sha la la la. Not like I faint, every time we touch. It's just some little thing. Not like every thing, I do depends on you. Sha la la la, sha la la la. Not like I faint, every time we touch. It's just some little thing. Not like every thing I doPras Michel. Miscellaneous. Ghetto Supastar (that Is What You Are). Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are). Pras Michel featuring Ol' Dirty Bastard & Mya. Album: Bulworth (The Soundtrack). [Ol' Dirty Bastard]. Man, man look up at the sky. All the stars man, the stars look beautiful tonight. Look at em!. Chorus: Mya. Ghetto superstar, that is what you are. Comin' from afar, reachin' for the stars. Run away with me, to another place. We can rely on each other, uh-huh. From one corner to another, uh-huh. [Pras]. Uh, yeah, yo, yo. Some got hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means. The supreme dream team, always up with the schemes. From hubcaps to sellin' raps, name your theme. My rise to the top, floatin' on this cream. Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me. A million refugees with unlimited warranties. Black Caesar, dating top skeezers. Diplomatic legalese, no time for a Visa. They just begun, I'ma shoot them one by one. Got five sides to me, somethin' like a pentagon. Strike with the forces of King Solomon. Lettin' bygones be bygones and so on and so on. I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto. Keepin' it retro-spective from the get-go. Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo. P-Politic with ghetto senators on the deelow. Chorus. [Ol' Dirty Bastard]. One two, and you don't stop, yo. My eyes are sore, bein' a senator. Behind closed doors hittin' truth to the seafloor. The rich go north ignore, the tug of war. While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores. So, I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more. I'ma reveal EVERYTHING, change the law. I find myself, walkin' the streets. Tryin' to find what's really goin' on in the streets. [Pras]. Yea, yo, yo, yo. Now every dog got his day, needless to say. When the chief away, that's when them cats want to play. I told you, mess around with fools like Cassius Clay. Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree. Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin' ballet. Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway. Get applause like a matador, cry yellin' !Ole!. Who the hell wanna' save me, from B.K., to Cali. Come on. Chorus. [Pras]. Yeah...yo, yeah. Just when you thought it was safe in a common place. Showcase your finest is losin' fast in the horse race. Two faced, gettin' defaced, out like Scarface. Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface. [Ol' Dirty Bastard]. Well I'm paranoid at the things I said. Wonderin' what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin' out. Partyin' with girls that never die, you see I was. Pickin' on the small fries, my campaign tellin' lies. Was just spreadin' my love, didn't know my love. Was the one holdin' the gun and the glove. But it's all good as long as it's understood. It's all together now, in the hooooooooooooooooooooooooooood. Chorus. [Pras]. Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh. Yeah. All stars, yeah yeah yeah. Chorus. [Ol' Dirty Bastard]. Sing it baby, sing it babyeeeeeeeeeeeeee. To another, aheoehahahahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Yeahhhh, heeee, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. From: "Rick Thompson"Many nights we pray. With no proof anyone could hear. And our hearts a hopeful song. We barely understand. Now we are not afraid. Although we know there's much to fear. We were moving mountains long. Before we know we could. Oh yes, there can be miracles. When you believe. Though hope is frail. It's hard to kill. Who knows what miracle. You can achieve. When you believe. Somehow you will. You will when you believe. In this time of fear. When prayer so often proves in vain. Hope seems like the summer birds. Too swiftly flown away. And now I am standing here. My heart's so full, I can't explain. Seeking faith and speaking words. I never thought I'd say. There can be miracles. When you believe. Though hope is frail. It's hard to kill. Who knows what miracles. You can achieve. When you believe. Somehow you will. You will when you believe. They don't always happen when you ask. And it's easy to give in to your fear, ohh. But when you're blinded by your pain. Can't see your way safe through the rain. Thought of a still resilient voice. Says love is very near. There can be miracles. When you believe. Though hope is frail. It's hard to kill. Who knows what miracles. You can achieve. When you believe. Somehow you will, how you will. You will when you believe. You will when you believe. Just believe. You will when you believe. Just believe. You will when you believeI'm a big big girl. In a big big world. It's not a big big thing if u leave me. But I do do feel. That I do do will.

She's got herself a universe gone quickly. For the call of thunder threatens everyone. And I feel like I just got home. And I feel. And I feel like I just got home. And I feel. Faster than the speeding light she's flying. Trying to remember where it all began. She's got herself a little piece of heaven. Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one. And I feel like I just got home. And I feel. And I feel like I just got home. And I feel. Quicker than a ray of light. Quicker than a ray of light. Quicker than a ray of light. Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder. Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?. She's got herself a universe gone quickly. For the call of thunder threatens everyone. And I feel. Quicker than a ray of light. Then gone for. Someone else will be there. Through the endless years. She's got herself a universe. She's got herself a universe. She's got herself a universe.

People coming, people going, people born to die. Don't ask me, because I don't know why. But it's like that, and that's the way it is. People in the world try to make ends meet. You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet. I said you got to work hard you want to compete. It's like that, and that's the way it is. Money is the key to end all your woes. Your ups and downs, your highs and your lows. Won't you tell me last time that love bought you clothes. It's like that, and that's the way it is. Bills fly higher every day. We receive much lower pay. I'd rather stay young, go out and play. It's like that, and that's the way it is. War's going on across the sea. Street soldiers killing the elderly. What ever happened to unity. It's like that, and that's the way it is. Disillusion is the word. That's used by me when I'm not heard. I just go through life with my glasses blurred. It's like that, and that's the way it is. You can see a lot in this lifespan. Like a bum eating out of a garbage can. You notice one time he was your man. It's like that, and that's the way it is. (What?). You should've gone to school, you could've learned a trade. But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid. Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid. It's like that, and that's the way it is. (What?). You know it's like that, and that's the way it is. Because it's like that, and that's the way it is. You know it's like that, and that's the way it is. Because it's like that. Check this out. Run-DMC and Jam Master J goin'. It's Run-DMC and Jam Master J goin'. It's Run-DMC and Jam Master J goin'.

The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught. It's like that, and that's the way it is. (What?). If you really think about it times aren't that bad. The one that stretches for successes will make you glad. Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad. It's like that, and that's the way it is. (What?). Check this out. You know it's like that, and that's the way it is. Because it's like that, and that's the way it is. You know it's like that, and that's the way it is.

You know there's a better way for you and me to be. . Look for the rainbow in every storm. Fly like an Angel, Heaven sent to me. . Goodbye, my friend.   (I know you're gone, you said you're gone).   (But I can still feel you here). It's not the end.   (Gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear). .

What a revelation. She found there's a better way, for you and me to be. . Look for the rainbow in every storm. Find out for certain. Love's gonna be there for you. You'll always be someone's baby. . Goodbye, my friend.   (I know you're gone, you said you're gone).   (But I can still feel you here). It's not the end.

No matter where they take us. We'll find our own way back. I can't deny what I believe. I can't be what I'm not. I know I'll love forever. I know, no matter what. If only tears were laughter. If only night was day. If only prayers were answered. Then we would hear God say. No matter what they tell you. No matter what they do. No matter what they teach you. What you believe is true. And I will keep you safe and strong. And sheltered from the storm. No matter where it's barren. A dream is being born. No matter who they follow. No matter where they lead. No matter how they judge us. I'll be everyone you need. No matter if the sun don't shine. Or if the skies are blue. No matter what the ending. My life began with you. I can't deny what I believe. I can't be what I'm not. I know, I know. I know this love's forever. That's all that matters now. No matter whatHow 'bout getting off of these antibiotics. How 'bout stopping eating when I'm full up. How 'bout them transparent dangling carrots. How 'bout that ever elusive kudo. Thank you India, thank you terror. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you frailty, thank you consequence. Thank you, thank you silence. How 'bout me not blaming you for everything. How 'bout me enjoying the moment for once. How 'bout how good it feels to finally forgive you. How 'bout grieving it all one at a time. Thank you India, thank you terror. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you frailty, thank you consequence. Thank you, thank you silence. The moment I let go of it was. The moment I got more than I could handle. The moment I jumped off of it was. The moment I touched down. How 'bout no longer being masochistic. How 'bout remembering your divinity. How 'bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out. How 'bout not equating death with stopping. Thank you India, thank you providence. Thank you disillusionment. Thank you nothingness, thank you clarity. Thank you, thank you silence, yeahDo you still remember how we used to be. Feeling together, believe in whatever my love has said to me. Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun. Felt like my savior, my spirit I gave you, we'd only just begun. Hasta Manana, always be mine. Viva forever, I'll be waiting. Everlasting like the sun. Live forever for the moment. Ever searching for the one. Yes, I still remember every whispered word. The touch of your skin giving life from within like a love song that I'd heard. Slipping through our fingers like the sands of time. Promises made, every memory saved has reflections in my mind. Hasta Manana, always be mine. Viva forever, I'll be waiting. Everlasting like the sun. Live forever for the moment. Ever searching for the one. Back where I belong now, was it just a dream?. Feelings unfold, they will never be sold and the secret's safe with me. Hasta Manana, always be mine. Viva forever, I'll be waiting. Everlasting like the sun. Live forever for the moment. Ever searching for the one. ...Mmm, yeah yeah yeah. Oh yeah, yeah yeah. Oh life, oh life. I'm afraid of the dark. Especially when I'm in a park. And there's no one else around.

I'm your angelI sit and wait. Does an angel. Contemplate my fate?. Do they know. The places where we go. When we're gray and old. 'Cause I've been told. That salvation. Lets their wings unfold. . So when I'm lyin' in my bed. Thoughts runnin' through my head. And I feel that love is dead. I'm lovin' angels instead. . And through it all. She offers me protection. A love and affection. Whether I'm right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won't break me. When I come to call. She won't forsake me. I'm lovin' angels instead. . When I'm feelin' weak. And my pain walks down. A one way street. I look above. And I know I'll always be blessed with love. . And as the feeling grows. She breathes flesh to my bones. An' when love is dead. I'm lovin' angels instead. . And through it all. She offers me protection. A lot of love and affection. Whether I'm right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won't break me. When I come to call. She won't forsake me. I'm lovin' angels instead. . And through it all. She offers me protection. A lot of love and affection. Whether I'm right or wrong. And down the waterfall. Wherever it may take me. I know that life won't break me. When I come to call. She won't forsake me. I'm lovin' angels insteadI am thinking of you. In my sleepless solitude tonight. If it's wrong to love you. Then my heart just won't let me be right. 'Cause I've drowned in you. And I won't pull through. Without you by my side. I'd give my all to have. Just one more night with you. I'd risk my life to feel. Your body next to mine. 'Cause I can't go on. Living in the memory of our song. I'd give my all for your love tonight. Baby can you feel me. Imagining I'm looking in your eyes. I can see you clearly. Vividly emblazoned in my mind. And yet you're so far. Like a distant star. I'm wishing on tonight. I'd give my all to have. Just one more night with you. I'd risk my life to feel. Your body next to mine. 'Cause I can't go on. Living in the memory of our song. I'd give my all for your love tonight. I'd give my all to have. Just one more night with you. I'd risk my life to feel. Your body next to mine. 'Cause I can't go on. Living in the memory of our song. I'd give my all for your love tonight. Give my all for your love. TonightLove is blind, as far as the eye can see. Deep and meaningless, words to me. Easy lover, I need a friend. Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end. Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me. (Pleases me). But short time solution ain't no resolution. That ain't no release for me. Too much of something is bad enough. But something's coming over me to make me wonder. Too much of nothing is just as tough. I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. Unwrap myself from around my finger. Hold me too tight or left to linger. Something fine built to last. Slipped up there I guess we're running out of time too fast. Yes my dear you know he shows me. (Moves me). There's no complication there's no explanation. It's just a groove in me. Too much of something is bad enough. (Bad enough). But something's coming over me to make me wonder. Too much of nothing is just as tough. (Just as tough). I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. What part of no don't you understand. (Understand, understand). I want a man not a boy who thinks he can. Boy who thinks he can. Too much of something is bad enough. But something's coming over me to make me wonder. Too much of nothing is just as tough. I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. Too much of something is bad enough. (Bad enough). But something's coming over me to make me wonder. Too much of nothing is just as tough. (Just as tough). I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied. Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try. Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie. Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try. Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie. Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try. Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie. Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try.

Do itIt's been one week since you looked at me. Cocked your head to the side and said I'm angry. Five days since you laughed at me saying. Get that together come back and see me. Three days since the living room. I realized it's all my fault but couldn't tell you. Yesterday, you'd forgiven me. But it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry. Hold it now and watch the hood wink. As I make you stop think. You'll think you're looking at aqua man. I summon fish to the dish although I like the Chalet Swiss. I like the Sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan. Hot like Wasabe when I bust rhymes. Big like Leann Rimes. Because I'm all about value. Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits. You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through. Gonna make a break and take a fake. I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake. I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors. Gotta see the show 'cause then you'll know. The vertigo is gonna grow. 'Cause it's so dangerous. You'll have to sign a waiver. How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?. Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad. I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral. Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will. I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve. I have a history of taking off my shirt. It's been one week since you looked at me. Threw your arms in the air and said you're crazy. Five days since you tackled me. I've still got the rug burns on both my knees. It's been three days since the afternoon. You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon. Yesterday, you'd forgiven me. And now I sit back and wait till you say you're sorry. Chickity China of the Chinese chicken. You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'. Watchin' X files with no lights on. We're dans la maison. I hope the smoking man's in this one. Like Harrison Ford I'm getting frantic. Like Sting I'm Tantric. Like snickers guaranteed to satisfy. Like Kurasawa I make mad films. Okay, I don't make films. But if I did they'd have a Samurai. Gonna get a set of better clubs. Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs. Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back swing. Gotta get in tune with sailor moon. 'Cause the cartoon has got the boom Anime Babes. That make me think the wrong thing. How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?. Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad. I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral. Can't understand what I mean?. Well, you soon will. I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve. I have a history of losing my shirt. It's been one week since you looked at me. Dropped your arms to your sides and said I'm sorry. Five days since I laughed at you and said. You just did just what I thought you were gonna do. Three days since the living room. We realized we're both to blame. But what could we do?. Yesterday, you just smiled at me. 'Cause it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry. It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry. It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry.

Sometimes I might even forget crew, my X-5 bulletproof, I turbo boost, and. blast right through in the ceiling and in the roof. . Comin through, hittin you, and knockin other suckas tooth's.

People in wylin, I think you need to wreak the sirene. . CHORUS' 1 and 2Everything's gonna be alright. Everything's gonna be alright. Whoever thought the sun would come crashing down. My life in flames, my tears concrete the pain. We feel the end, the darkest, deepest riverbed. My book of life ain't complete without you here. Alone I sit and reminisce, sometimes. I miss your touch, your kiss, your smile. And meanwhile you know I never cry. 'Cuz deep down inside. You know our love will never ever die. Everything's gonna be alright. (Yeah). Everything's gonna be okay. (No doubt). Everything's gonna be alright. (Together we can take this one day at a time). Can you take my breath away?. (Yeah). Can you give him life today?. (No doubt). Is everything gonna be okay?. (I'll be your strength, I'll be here when you wake up). (Take your time, and I'll be here when you wake up). I never thought my heart would miss a single beat. Caress your hands, as I watch you while you sleep. So sweet, I weep as I search within. To find a cure, to bring you back again. And the sun will rise, open up your eyes.

But love is all I have to giveWe made up their minds and they started packing. We left before the sun came up that day. An exit to eternal summer slacking. But where were they going without ever knowing the way?. We drank up the wine and they got to talking. We now had more important things to say. And when the car broke down they started walking. Where were they going without ever knowing the way?. Anyone could see the road that they walk on is paved in gold. And it's always summer, they'll never get cold. They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and gray. You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere. They won't make it home but they really don't care. They wanted the highway they're happier there today, today. The children woke up and they couldn't find 'em. We left before the sun came up that day. We just drove off and left it all behind 'em. But where were they going without ever knowing the way?. Anyone could see the road that they walk on is paved in gold. It's always summer, they'll never get cold. They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and gray. You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere. They won't make it home but they really don't care. They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today. Anyone could see the road that they walk on is paved in gold. It's always summer, they'll never get cold.

They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, todayIf I could tell the world just one thing. It would be that we're all OK. And not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful. And useless in times like these. I won't be made useless. I won't be idle with despair. I will gather myself around my faith. For light does the darkness most fear. My hands are small, I know. But they're not yours, they are my own. But they're not yours, they are my own. And I am never broken. Poverty stole your golden shoes. But it didn't steal your laughter. And heartache came to visit me. But I knew it wasn't ever after. We'll fight, not out of spite. For someone must stand up for what's right. 'Cause where there's a man who has no voice. There ours shall go singing . My hands are small I know. But they're not yours, they are my own. But they're not yours, they are my own. And I am never broken. In the end only kindness matters. In the end only kindness matters. I will get down on my knees, and I will pray. I will get down on my knees, and I will pray. I will get down on my knees, and I will pray. My hands are small I know. But they're not yours, they are my own. But they're not yours, they are my own. And I am never broken. My hands are small I know. But they're not yours, they are my own. But they're not yours, they are my own. And I am never broken. We are never broken. We are God's eyes. God's hands. God's mind. We are God's eyes. God's hands. God's heart. We are God's eyes. God's hands. God's eyes. We are God's hands. We are God's handsGreen Day. Miscellaneous. Time Of Your Life (Good Riddance). Another turning point a fork stuck in the road . Time grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go . So make the best of this test and don't ask why . It's not a question but a lesson learned in time . . Chorus . It's something unpredictable but in the end . It's right I hope you've had the time of your life . . So take the photographs and still frames in your mind . Hang it on a shelf in good heath and good time . Tattoos and memories and dead skin on trial . For what it's worth it was worth all the while . . Chorus . It's something unpredictable but in the end . It's right I hope you've had the time of your lifeHangin' round downtown by myself. And I had so much time. To sit and think about myself. And then there she was. Like double cherry pie. Yeah there she was. Like disco superfly. I smell sex and candy here. Who's that lounging in my chair. Who's that casting devious stares. In my direction. Mama this surely is a dream. Hangin' round downtown by myself. And I had too much caffeine. And I was thinkin' 'bout myself. And then there she was. In double platform suede. Yeah there she was. Like disco lemonade. I smell sex and candy here. Who's that lounging in my chair. Who's that casting devious stares. In my direction. Mama this surely is a dream. Mama this surely is a dream. Yeah mama this must be my dreamI woke up and called this morning. The tone of your voice was a warning. That you don't care for me anymore. I made up the bed we sleep in. I looked at the clock when you creep in. It's six AM and I'm alone. Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending. To the bad day I was just beginning. When you go all I know is you're my favorite mistake. Your friends act sorry for me. They watch you pretend to adore me. But I'm no fool to this game. Now here comes your secret lover. She'll be unlike any other. Until your guilt goes up in flames.. Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending. To the bad day I'd gotten used to spending. When you go all I know is you're my favorite mistake. You're my favorite mistake. Well maybe nothing lasts forever. Even when you stay together. I don't need forever after, but it's your laughter won't let me go. So I'm holding on this way. Did you know could you tell you were the only one. That I ever loved?. Now everything's so wrong. Did you see me walking by, did it ever make you cry?. Now you're my favorite mistake. Yeah you're my favorite mistake. You're my favorite mistakeBaby, baby, tell me what's up. Can you hear me, or do I, do I need to turn it up, huh? Huh?. Baby, baby, tell me what's up. Can you hear me, or do I, do I need to turn it up, huh? What?. Baby, baby, tell me what's up. Can you hear me, or do I, do I need to turn it up, huh? Huh?. Baby, baby, tell me what's up. Can you hear me, or do I, do I need to turn it up, huh? What?. Boy, this evening, was it only me. Feeling completely down to be open. Down to be open for some satisfaction. Didn't wanna say yes, 'fraid of your reaction. I knew it was wrong for feeling this way. Especially the thought of giving in on the first date. Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind. At the end of the night, I had to decide. I was thinkin'. I should make a move, but I won't (I should, I should). I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong. Knowing if I do that it won't be right. I don't get down on the first night. I should make a move, but I won't. I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong. Knowing if I do that it won't be right. I wanna get down, but not the first night. We were chillin', watchin' your tv. I felt it was coming the closer that you got to me. Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you. And somehow in one night discover I love you. Felt so right, but it felt so wrong. And look how we are carrying on. Trying to say things to get me to stay. But my watch is telling me it's getting too late. I'm thinkin'. I should make a move, but I won't (I should, I should). I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (Knowing). Knowing if I do that it won't be right (Be right). I don't get down on the first night (I don't, I don't get down, baby). I should make a move, but I won't. I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (You're probably thinkin' something's wrong). Knowing if I do that it won't be right (Be right). I wanna get down, but not the first night. If you want me, you've got to know me (Got to know me). And if you want my love (my love). You've gotta wait, my love. Hey baby, that's the way it's got to be, yeah. Get to know me (get to know me). So we can do this. I should make a move (ohhhhhhh). I know you're probably thinkin' (I won't, I won't, baby). Knowing if I do (I won't, I won't, baby). I don't get down on the first night. I should make a move, but I won't (no, no, no). I know you're probably thinking something is wrong (oh no, no, no). Knowing if I do that it won't be right. I wanna get down, but not the first night (I wanna get down, but not the first night). (to end)Adia I do believe I failed you. Adia I know I've let you down. Don't you know I tried so hard. To love you in my way. It's easy let it go. Adia I'm empty since you left me. Trying to find a way to carry on. I search myself and everyone. To see where we went wrong. 'Cause there's no one left to finger. There's no one here to blame. There's no one left to talk to, honey. And there ain't no one to buy our innocence. 'Cause we are born innocent. Believe me Adia, we are still innocent. It's easy, we all faulter. Does it matter?. Adia I thought that we could make it. But I know I can't change the way you feel. I leave you with your misery.

Hey, I know it's just a song, but it's spice for the recipe. This is a love attack. I know it went out, but it's back. It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact. And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with-it and hip. If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique. So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out. Allow if you're still alive. Six to eight years to arrive. And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow. But if the offer's shunned. You might as well be walking on the Sun. Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out. Of recession and oppression and together they toked. And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire. Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened?. Then some were spellbound, some were hellbound. Some, they fell down and some got back up. And fought back against the meltdown. And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites. Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it. So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out. Allow if you're still alive. Six to eight years to arrive. And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow. But if the offer's shunned. You might as well be walking on the Sun. It ain't no joke. When a mama's handkerchief is soaked. With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked. The bond is broke up. So choke up and focus on the close up. Mr. Wizard can't perform no god-like hocus-pocus. So don't sit back, kick back. And watch the world get bushwhacked. News at 10, your neighborhood is under attack. Put away the crack, before the crack puts you away. You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate. So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out. Allow if you're still alive. Six to eight years to arrive. And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow. But if the offer's shunned. You might as well be walking on the Sun. You might as well be walking on the Sun. You might as well be walking on the Sun. You might as well be walking on the Sun. You might as well be walking on the Sun...Dirty South. (Uh huh). Can y'all really feel me?. (Feel this). East Coast feel me. (Feel this). West Coast feel me. (Say what?). . Dirty South.

But you are my only. I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play. Hand over my heart I'll find my way. I will make them give to me. Immortality. There is a vision and a fire in me. I keep the memory of you and me, inside. And we don't say goodbye. We don't say goodbye. With all my love for you. And what else we may do. We don't say, goodbyeThis is my church.

What have I done?. When will all my hopes arise?. How will I know him. When I look in my father's eyes?.   (Look into my father's eyes). My father's eyes. When I looked in my father's eyes.   (Look into my father's eyes). My father's eyes. Then the light begins to shine. And I hear those ancient lullabies. And as I watch this seedling grow. Feel my heart start to overflow. Where do I find the words to say?. How do I teach him?. What do we play?. Bit by bit, I've realized. That's when I need them. That's when I need my father's eyes.   (Look into my father's eyes). My father's eyes. That's when I need my father's eyes.   (Look into my father's eyes). My father's eyes.   (Yeah). Then the jagged edge appears. Through the distant clouds of tears. Now I'm like a bridge that was washed away. My foundations were made of clay. As my soul slides down to die. How could I lose him?. What did I try?. Bit by bit, I've realized. That he was here with me. And I looked into my father's eyes.   (Look into my father's eyes). My father's eyes. I looked into my father's eyes.   (Look into my father's eyes). My father's eyes.

You haven't found it baby, that's for sure. You rip me up and spread me all around. In the dust of the dead of time. And this is not a case of lust, you see. It's not a matter of you versus me. It's fine the way you want me on your own. But in the end it's always me alone. And I'm losing my favorite game. You're losing your mind again. I'm losing my baby. Losing my favorite game. I only know what I've been working for. Another you so I could love you more. I really thought that I could take you there. But my experiment is not getting us anywhere. I had a vision I could turn you right. A stupid mission and a legal fight. I should have seen it when my hope was new. My heart is black and my body is blue. And I'm losing my favorite game. You're losing your mind again. I'm losing my favorite game. You're losing your mind again. I'm losing my baby. Losing my favorite game. I'm losing my favorite game. You're losing your mind again.

It's all about the money, it's all about the. I think we got it all wrong anyway. Strange ways of showing how much we really care. When in face we don't seem to care at all. This pretty world is getting out of hand. So how come we fail to understand?. It's all about the money, it's all about the dum dum. And I don't think it's funny to see us fade away. It's all about the money, it's all about the. I think we got it all wrong anywayIt's you that I adore. You always be my whore. You be the mother to my child. And a child to my heart.

Where did she gone? where the rose bush rise up. Are you wicked than bandolero. Then a-better wise up. Or we go, ash to ash, and dust onto the dust. You just big up a chest and go loco. (repeat chours). Smile up on the face. Make the next plan. Wiggle the bottom to attract the next man. Rude boys, beware. This one's a-come fe run the things. Swing them together. Like vendetta the gun things. She lick a shot, sa, to get. She take care of dha freak. And you get the money. Cause her punani popularity. Bum, bye-bye, she make a grown man cry. She just big up her chest and go loco. Come on. (rpt chorus twice)So open up your morning light. And say a little prayer for I. You know that if we are to stay alive. Then see the peace in every eye. She had two babies, one was six months, one was three. In the war of '44. Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging. When she thought it was God calling her. Oh, would her son grow to know his father?. I don't want to to wait for our lives to be over. I want to know right now what will it be. I don't want to wait for our lives to be over. Will it be yes or will it be sorry?. He showed up all wet on the rainy front step. Wearing shrapnel in his skin. And the war he saw lives inside him still. It's so hard to be gentle and warm. The years pass by and now he has granddaughters. I don't want to to wait for our lives to be over. I want to know right now what will it be. I don't want to wait for our lives to be over. Will it be yes or will it be sorry?. You look at me from across the room. You're wearing your anguish again. Believe me I know the feeling. It sucks you into the jaws of anger. So breathe a little more deeply my love. All we have is this very moment. And I don't want to do what his father. And his father, and his father did. I want to be here now. So open up your morning light. And say a little prayer for I. You know that if we are to stay alive. Then see the love in every eye. I don't want to to wait for our lives to be over. I want to know right now what will it be. I don't want to wait for our lives to be over. Will it be yes or will it be sorry?Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning I sit around.

The priest is on the phone. Your father hit the wall. Your ma disowned you. Don't suppose I'll ever know. What it means to be a man. Something I can't change. I'll live around it. I wanna wake up where you are. I won't say anything at all. So why don't you slide. Mmm slide. And I'll do anything you ever. Dreamed to be complete. Little pieces of the nothing that, fall.

Just slide into my room. Oh, we'll run away, run away, run awayYou tell me you're in love with me. Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me. It's not that I don't want to stay. But every time you come too close I move away. I wanna believe in everything that you say. 'Cause it sounds so good. But if you really want me move slow. There's things about me you just have to know. Sometimes I run. Sometimes I hide. Sometimes I'm scared of you. But all I really want is to hold you tight. Treat you right, be with you day and night. Baby, all I need is time. I don't wanna be so shy. Every time that I'm alone I wonder why. Hope that you will wait for me. You'll see that you're the only one for me. I wanna believe in everything that you say. 'Cause it sounds so good. But if you really want me move slow. There's things about me you just have to know. Sometimes I run (sometimes). Sometimes I hide. Sometimes I'm scared of you. But all I really want is to hold you tight. Treat you right, be with you day and night. All I really want is to hold you tight. Treat you right, be with you day and night. Baby all I need is time. Just hang around and you'll see. There's nowhere I'd rather be. If you love me, trust in me. The way that I trust in you. Sometimes I run (sometimes). Sometimes I hide. Sometimes I'm scared of you (oh). But all I really want is to hold you tight (hold you tight). Treat you right, be with you day and night (day and night). Sometimes I run (sometimes). Sometimes I hide. Sometimes I'm scared of you. But all I really want is to hold you tight.

Sometimes I'm scared of you. But all I really want is to hold you tightShe moves like she don't care. Smooth as silk, cool as air. Ooh it makes you wanna cry. She doesn't know your name. And your heart beats like a subway train. Ooh it makes you wanna die. Ooh, don't you wanna take her?. Wanna make her all your own?. Maria, you've gotta see her. Go insane and out of your mind. Latina, Ave Maria. A million and one candle lights. I've seen this thing before. In my best friend and the boy next door. Fool for love and full of fire. Won't come in from the rain. She's oceans running down the drain. Blue as ice and desire. Don't you wanna make her?. Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?. Maria, you've gotta see her. Go insane and out of your mind. Latina, Ave Maria. A million and one candle lights. Ooh, don't you wanna break her?. Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?. She walks like she don't care. Walkin' on imported air. Ooh, it makes you wanna die. Maria, you've gotta see her. Go insane and out of your mind. Latina, Ave Maria. A million and one candle lights. Maria, you've gotta see her. Go insane and out of your mind. Latina, Ave Maria. A million and one candle lightsCome on, come on. I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself. Is life worth living, should I blast myself?. I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black. My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch. Cops give a damn about a negro. Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero. Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares. One less hungry mouth on the welfare. First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers. Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other. It's time to fight back that's what Huey said. Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead. I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere. Unless we share with each other. We gotta start makin' changes. Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers. And that's how it's supposed to be. How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?. I'd love to go back to when we played as kids. But things changed, that's the way it is. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. I see no changes, all I see is racist faces. Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races. We under, I wonder what it takes to make this. One better place, let's erase the wasted. Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right. 'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight. And only time we chill is when we kill each other. It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other. And although it seems heaven sent. We ain't ready, to see a black President. It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact. The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks. But some things will never change. Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game. Now tell me, what's a mother to do?. Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you. You gotta operate the easy way. I made a G today, but you made it in a sleazy way. Sellin' crack to the kid, I gotta get paid. Well hey, well, that's the way it is. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. We gotta make a change. It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes. Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live. And let's change the way we treat each other. You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do. What we gotta do, to survivem. And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?. There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East. Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs. So the police can bother me. And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do. But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you. Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up. Crack you up and pimps smack you up. You gotta learn to hold ya own. They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone. But tell the cops, they can't touch this. I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this. That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool?. My mama didn't raise no fool. And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped. And I never get to lay back. 'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs. Some buck that I roughed up way back. Comin' back after all these years. Rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, that's the way it is. That's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. That's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. Some things will never changeHow did I ever let you slip away?. Never knowing, I'd be singing this song some day. And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more. Ever since you closed the door. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then my darlin', you'd still be mine. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine. Funny, funny how time goes by. And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye. Oh why, oh why should one have to go on suffering?. When every day I pray, please come back to me. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then my darlin' you, you'd be mine. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then my darlin', you still be mine. And you had enough love for the both of us. But I, I, I did you wrong I admit I did. But now, I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then my darlin' you, you'd be mine, whao. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then my darlin', you still be mine. Oh, I'd never hurt you.   (If I could turn back). Never do you wrong.   (If I could turn back). And never leave your side.   (If I could turn back the hands). Turn back the hands. There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you.   (If I could turn back). Forever honest and true to you.   (If I could turn back). If you accept me back in your heart, I love you.   (If I could turn back the hands).   (If I could turn back). That would be my will.   (If I could turn back). Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands.   (If I could turn back the hands). I'm going down, yes I am.   (If I could turn back). Down on my bended knee, yeah.   (If I could turn back). And I'm gonna be right there, until you return to me.   (If I could turn back the hands).   (If I could turn back). Just turn back that little clock on the wall.   (If I could turn back). Then I'd come to realize how much, I love you.   (If I could turn back the hands).   (If I could turn back). Love you.   (If I could turn back). Love you.   (If I could turn back the hands). Love you. Love you.   (If I could turn back). (If I could turn back). (If I could turn back the hands)Have you ever loved somebody so much. It makes you cry. Have you ever needed something so bad.

Gotta get you in my world. 'Cuz baby I can't sleep. Have you ever loved somebody so much. It makes you cry. Have you ever needed something so bad. You can't sleep at night. Have you ever tried to find the words. But they don't come out right. Have you ever, have you everSomebody once told me. The world is gonna roll me. I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was looking kinda dumb. With her finger and her thumb. In shape of an "L" on her forehead. Well the years start coming. And they don't stop coming. Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.

Pack your bags up and leave.. And don't you dare come. Running back to me.. It's not right, but it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway. Close the door behind you. Leave your key. I'd rather be alone than unhappy. Verse 2. I'm packing bags so you can leave town for a week. The phone rings then you look at me (why'd you turn and look at me). You said it was one of your friends from over 54th street. So why did 213 show up on your caller ID.. I've been through all this before. So how could you think.. That I would stand around. And take some more. Things are gonna change.. Cause I won't be a fool anymore. That's why you have to leave.. So don't turn around to see my face. Cause there's no more tears. Left here for you to see.. Verse 3. Now is it really worth you going out like that. See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back. See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for me. It turns out, you were making a fool of me.. Hook(repeat out)Like a movie scene. in the sweetest dreams. I have pictured us together.

Waiting for tonight.It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart. Without saying a word, you can light up the dark. Try as I may I can never explain. What I hear when you don't say a thing. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall. You say it best, when you say nothing at all. All day long I can hear people talking out loud. But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd. Try as they may they could never define. What's been said between your heart and mine. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall. You say it best when you say noting at all. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.

(You say it best when you say nothing at all. You say it best when you say nothing at all.). That smile on your face. The truth in your eyes. The touch of your hand. Let's me know that you need me. (You say it best when you say nothing at all. You say it best when you say nothing at all.)They say around the way you've asked for me. There's even talk about you wanting me. I must admit that's what I want to hear. But that's just talk until you take me there, oh. . If it's true don't leave me all alone out here. Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there. Tell me what you're feeling 'cause I need to know. Girl you've gotta let me know which way to go. . 'Cause I need to know, I need to know. Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know. I need to know, I need to know. Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know. . My every thought is of this being true. It's getting harder not to think of you. Girl I'm exactly where I wanna be.

Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to knowSpend all your time waiting. For that second chance. For a break that would make it okay. There's always some reason. To feel not good enough. And it's hard at the end of the day. I need some distraction. Oh beautiful release. Memories seep from my veins. Let me be empty. Oh and weightless and maybe. I'll find some peace tonight. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you fear. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort here. So tired of the straight line. And everywhere you turn. There's vultures and thieves at your back. The storm keeps on twisting. Keep on building the lies. That you make up for all that you lack. It don't make no difference. Escaping one last time. It's easier to believe. In this sweet madness. Oh this glorious sadness. That brings me to my knees. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you fear. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort here. You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort hereI wanna know. Who ever told you I was letting go?. The only joy that I have ever known. Girl, they were lying. Just look around. And all of the people that we used to know. Just gave it up, they wanna let it go. But we're still trying. So, you should know this love we shared was never made to die. I'm glad we're on this one way street, just you and I. Just you and I. I'm never gonna say goodbye. 'Cause I never wanna see you cry. I swore to you my love would remain. And I swear it all over again and I. I'm never gonna treat you bad. 'Cause I never wanna see you sad. I swore to share your joy and your pain. And I swear it all over again. All over again. Some people say. That everything has got it's place and time. Even the day must give way to the night. But I'm not buying. 'Cause in your eyes. I see a love that burns internally. And if you see how beautiful you are to me. You know I'm not lying. Shall there be times we wanna say goodbye but even if we try. There are some things in this life won't be denied. Won't be denied. I'm never gonna say goodbye. 'Cause I never wanna see you cry. I swore to you my love would remain. And I swear it all over again and I. I'm never gonna treat you bad. 'Cause I never wanna see you sad. I swore to share your joy and your pain. And I swear it all over again. The more I know of you. Is the more I know I love you. And the more that I'm sure. I want you forever and ever more. And the more that you love me. The more that I know.... That I'm never gonna let you go. Gotta let you know that I (I'm never gonna say goodbye). 'Cause I never wanna see you cry. I swore to you my love would remain. And I swear it all over again and I. I'm never gonna treat you bad. 'Cause I never wanna see you sad. I swore to share your joy and your pain. And I swear it all over again. All over again. All over again. I'd swear it all over againAt first we started out real cool. Taking me places I ain't never been. But now, you're getting comfortable. Ain't doing those things you did no more. You're slowly making me pay for things. Your money should be handling. And now you ask to use my car. Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank. And you have the audacity. To even come and step to me. Ask to hold some money from me. Until you get your check next week. You triflin', good for nothing type of brother. Silly me, why haven't I found another?. A baller, when times get hard, I need someone to help me out. Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about. Can you pay my bills?. Can you pay my telephone bills?. Do you pay my automo' bills?. If you did then maybe we could chill. I don't think you do. So, you and me are through. Can you pay my bills?. Can you pay my telephone bills?. Do you pay my automo' bills?. If you did then maybe we could chill. I don't think you do. So, you and me are through. Now you've been maxing out my card. Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends. Haven't paid the first bill. But instead you're headin' to the mall. Goin' on shopping sprees. Perpetrating to your friends like you be ballin'. And then you use my cell phone. Callin' whoever that you thinks at home. And then when the bill comes. All of a sudden you be acting dumb. Don't know where none of these calls come from. When your mommas number's here more than once. You triflin', good for nothing type of brother. Silly me, why haven't I found another?. A baller, when times get hard, I need someone to help me out. Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about. Can you pay my bills?.

There's nothing you can say or do for me. And I don't want a miracle. You'll never change for no one. And I hear your reasons why. Where did you sleep last night?. And was she worth it,. was she worth it?. I'm strong enough to live without you. Strong enough and I quit crying. Long enough. now I'm strong enough. To know you gotta go. There's no more to say. So save your breath and walk away. No matter what I hear you say. I'm strong enough. to know you gotta go. So you feel misunderstood. Baby have I got news for you. On being used, I could write the book. But you don't wanna hear about it. 'Cause I've been losing sleep. And you've been going cheap. And she ain't worth half of me it's true. I'm telling you, that. I'm strong enough to live without you. Strong enough and I quit crying. Long enough now I'm strong enough. To know you gotta go. Come hell or waters high. You'll never see me cry.

Now I'm strong enough...It's undeniable that we should be together. It's unbelievable how I used to say, â€½That I'd fall neverâ€. The basis is need to know if you don't know just how I feel. Then let me show you now that I'm for real. If all things in time, time will reveal, yeah. One, you're like a dream come true. Two, just wanna be with you. Three, girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me. And four, repeat steps one through three. Five, make you fall in love with me. If ever I believe my work is done then I'll start back at one, yeah. It's so incredible the way things work themselves out. And all emotional once you know what it's all about, hey. And undesirable for us to be apart, never would've made it very far. 'Cause you know you got the keys to my heart. 'Cause. One, you're like a dream come true. Two, just wanna be with you. Three, girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me. And four, repeat steps one through three. Five, make you fall in love with me. If ever I believe my work is done then I'll start back at one. Say farewell to the dark of night, I see the coming of the sun. I feel like a little child whose life has just begun. You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine. You threw out the lifeline just in the nick of time. One, you're like a dream come true. Two, just wanna be with you. Three, girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me. And four, repeat steps one through three. Five, make you fall in love with me. If ever I believe my work is done then I'll start back at oneI was lying on the grass. On Sunday morning of last week. Indulging in my self defeats. My mind was thugged. All laced and bugged. All twisted round and beat. Uncomfortable three feet deep. Now the fuzzy stare from not being there. On a confusing morning week. Impaired my tribal lunar-speak. And of course you can't become. If you only say what you would have done. So I missed a million miles of fun. I know it's up for me. (If you steal my sunshine). Making sure I'm not in too deep. (If you steal my sunshine). Keeping versed and on my feet. (If you steal my sunshine). I was frying on the bench slide. In the park across the street. L A T E R that week. My sticky paws were into making straws. Out of big fat slurpy treats. An incredible eight foot heap. Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tear. In a staring under heat. Involved an under usual feat. And I'm not only among. But I invite who I want to come. So I missed a million miles of fun. I know it's up for me. (If you steal my sunshine). Making sure I'm not in too deep. (If you steal my sunshine). Keeping versed and on my feet. (If you steal my sunshine). I know it's done for me. (If you steal my sunshine). Not something hard to see. (If you steal my sunshine). Keeping dumb and built to beat. (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine. (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine. (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine. (If you steal my sunshine). ...You know this boogie is for real. I used to put my faith in worship. But then my chance to get to heaven slipped. I used to worry about the future. But then I threw my caution to the wind. I had no reason to be care free, no, no, no.

Through each one of my eyelids?. (Uh, huh). Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?. (Yeah, yeah). Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?. (Huh?). My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight. But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate. (Umm). And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead". Uh, uhh, So why's your face red?  Man you wasted. Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else. 'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt. Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off. And smacked her so hard. I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross. I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass. Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast. C'mere slut. (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog). I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off. Hi, my name is, my name is. (What? Who?). My name is Slim Shady. Hi, my name is, my name is. (Huh? What?). My name is Slim Shady. My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high. Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five. I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler. And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers. (Oww). Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up. Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup. Extraterrestrial, runnin' over pedestrians. In a spaceship while they screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends". Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to. I just found out my mom does more dope than I do. (Damn). I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper. Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her. (Oh, thank you). You know you blew up when the women rush your stands. And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans. (Aah). This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph. (Dude, can I get your autograph?). So I signed it "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole". Hi, my name is, my name is. (What? Who?). My name is Slim Shady. Hi, my name is, my name is. (Huh? What?). My name is Slim Shady. Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away. (Get him). Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate. I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die. (Fuck that). I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive. (Huh, yup). Am I comin' or goin'?  I can barely decide. I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?. (Go ahead). All my life I was very deprived. I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide. Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk. (Hachhh-too). I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks. (C'mere). When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits. How you gonna breast feed me, mom?. (Wah). You ain't got no tits. (Wah). I lay awake and strap myself in the bed. Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head. I'm steamin' mad. And by the way when you see my dad?. (Yeah?). Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had. Hi, my name is, my name is. (What? Who?). My name is Slim Shady. Hi, my name is, my name is. (Huh?

If I could offer you only one tip for the future,. Sunscreen would be it. The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists. whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience…. I will dispense this advice now.... Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. oh nevermind;. you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself. and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before. you and how fabulous you really looked…. You are not as fat as you imagine. Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as. effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that. never crossed your worried mind. the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday. Do one thing everyday that scares you. Sing. Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. don't put up with people who are reckless with yours. Floss. Don't waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind…. the race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself. Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults. if you succeed in doing this, tell me how. Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements. Stretch. Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life…. the most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't. Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone. Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding. anniversary…. what ever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either. your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's. Enjoy your body. use it every way you can…. don't be afraid of it, or what other people think of it. it's the greatest instrument you'll ever own. Dance…even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room. Read the directions, even if you don't follow them. Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly. Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. they are the best link to your past. and the people most likely to stick with you in the future. Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle. because the older you get. the more you need the people you knew when you were young. Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel. Accept certain inalienable truths. prices will rise. politicians will philander. you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young. prices were reasonable. politicians were noble. and children respected their elders. Respect your elders. Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. maybe you have a wealthy spouse. but you never know when either one might run out. Don't mess too much with your hair. or by the time you're 40, it will look 85. Be careful whose advice you buy, but. be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off. painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth. But trust me on the sunscreenShe grew up with the children of the stars. In the Hollywood hills and the Boulevard. Her parents threw big parties everyone was there. They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper. Bob Seeger and Sonny and Cher. And she feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax. And from the stage I can tell that she can't let go and she can't relax. And just before she hangs her head to cry. I sing to her a lullaby. I sing. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Rockabye. She still lives with her Mom outside the city. Down that street about a half a mile. And all her friends tell her. She's so pretty. But she'd be a whole lot prettier. If she smiled once in a while. 'Cause even her smile looks like a frown. And she's seen her share of devils in this angel town. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye, rockabye. I told her I ain't so sure about this place. It's hard to play a gig in this town. Keep a straight face. And seems like everybody's got a plan. It's kind of like Nashville with a tan. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. So rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Rockabye. Bye bye. Bye byeSee he's my property and any girl that touch. I might just call your bluff 'cause I don't give a, whoo. Are you to call my cell, oh, I'ma wish you well. 'Cause any girl that tried has fell.

Well is you feelin' that, well put one hand up. Can you repeat that, tryin' to take my man. See I don't need that. You must learn the rules. Don't come close to anything that belongs to me. He is my, my property. So don't you see. Where my girls at, from the front to back. Well is you feelin' that, well put one hand up. Can you repeat that, tryin' to take my man.

See I don't need thatNo, oh, no. Yeah, yeah, oh. You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside. I know it's crazy, but you still can touch my heart. And after all this time you think that I wouldn't feel the same. But time melts into nothing and nothing's changed. I still believe, someday you and me. Will find ourselves in love again. I had a dream, someday you and me. Will find ourselves in love again. Each day of my life, I'm filled with all the joy I could find. You know that I, I'm not the desperate type. If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp, I'd hold it with both hands. It's worth the risk of burning, to have a second chance. No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby. I still believe that we can be together, no, no, no. If we believe that true love never has to end. Then we must know that we will love again. I still believe, someday you and me. Will find ourselves in love again, oh, baby, yeah, yeah. I had a dream you and me. Will find ourselves in love again. I still believe. (Ooh, baby, I do). Someday you and me. (Just give me one more try). In love again. I had a dream. (I miss your love). Someday you and me. Will find ourselves in love again. I still believe, someday you and me. Will find ourselves in love againGood looking, bad tasting. Full bodied, butt wasted. Loose living, tight fitting. What you see ain't what you are getting. Big make up, little break up. She wants it, he's got it. Cold blooded, hot gossip. Superficial expectations. Look at me, you can take it all. Because this face is free. Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Baby, I can even do reality. Fake honey, real plastic. Stupid cupid, fantastic. Queer thinking, straight talking. What you see ain't what you are getting. Fast loving, slow moving. No rhythm but I'm grooving. Old feeling, new beginning. Superficial expectations. Look at me, you can take it all. Because this face is free. Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Baby, I can even do reality. That's me. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Sometimes I don't recognize my own face. I look inside my eyes and find disgrace. My little white lies tell a story. I see it all, it has no glory. Look at me, you can take it all. Because this face is free. Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Baby, I can even do reality. Come on and look at me. This face is free, I'm your fantasy. So who'd you wanna be, not what you see. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Come on and look at me, I'm your fantasy. This face is freeAll I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me. Somebody I can love for them. All this money don't mean shit. If you ain't got nobody to share it with. Love rules the world, you feel me. He don't understand you like I do. No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me. 'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love. And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you. When it hurt I ease the pain, girl. Caress your frame, get them worries off your brain, girl. I'm in your corner do what you want it's your thing, girl. Oppositess attract, but we one in the same, girl it ain't a game. So I can't play with you, wanna lay with you. Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you. In good and bad times we'll always make it through. 'Cause what we got is true no matter what they say to you. I can straight lace you, not just appearance. Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits. Be the voice of reason when you ain't tryin' hear it. You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it. Sit her on the sofa get a little closer. Touch it right, do it like a man's supposed to. Knew you was the one, that's why I chose ya. 'Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier. He don't understand you like I do. No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me. 'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love. And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you. Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy. Feel emptiness inside I can fill that void. When you spend time with your woman and listen. It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten. I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth. 'Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself. I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt. And prove to you you're more important than anything else. Worthwhile, special like my first child. When I see your face it's always like the first time. Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together and they tried yet. I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet. Hold you, mold you, drink no liquor, show you. Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to. Let it be known, I told you. And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true. He don't understand you like I do. No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me. 'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love. And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you. Don't let him sing you a sad song, no baby. Waiting for love like this too long. (You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby). All that you need I can give you. (You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on). I do, satisfy you. (You don't have to wait on him). I'm the light when you can't see, I'm that air when you can't breathe. I'm that feeling when you can't leave. Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive. So it's only you and me. When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong. I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong. Keep you away from harm, my love is protected. I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected. I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare. In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared. Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you. Wanted to be there 'cause I could hold it down for you. Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil. Make love all night, bending bed coils. You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal. This is all for you, 'cause I simply adore you. He don't understand you like I do. No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me. 'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love. And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you. He don't understand you like I do. No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me. 'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love. And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy youDay after day. Time passed away. And I just can't get you off my mind. Nobody knows, I hide it inside. I keep on searching but I can't find. The courage to show to letting you know. I've never felt so much love before. And once again I'm thinking about. Taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah). How will I know if I let you go?. Night after night I hear myself say. Why can't this feeling just fade away?. There's no one like you (No one like you). You speak to my heart (Speak to my heart). It's such a shame we're worlds apart. I'm too shy to ask, I'm too proud to lose but sooner or later I gotta choose. And once again I'm thinking about. Taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah). How will I know if I let you go?. If I let you go ooh baby. Ooooohh. Once again I'm thinking about taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah). How will I know (If I let you go?). But if I let you go I will never know (Oh baby). Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah). How will I know if I let you go?I met you. Before the fall of Rome. And I begged you. To let me take you home. You were wrong. I was right. You said, "Goodbye". I said, "Good night". It's all been done. It's all been done before. I knew you. Before the west was won. And I heard you say. The past was much more fun. You go your way. I'll go mine. That I'll see you. Next time. It's all been done. It's all been done before. If I put my fingers here. And if I say, "I love you dear". And if I play the same three chords. Will you just yawn and say?. "It's all been done. It's all been done before". Alone and bored. On a thirtieth century night. Will I see you. On the price is right?. Will I cry?. Will I smile?. As you run. Down the aisle. It's all been done. It's all been done. It's all been done before. It's all been done. It's all been done. It's all been doooooooone... beforeAnn Lee. Miscellaneous. 2 Times. ===================. Ann Lee - 2 Times. ===================.

Over this town followin' you. Over the trees, subways and cars. I'd try to find out who you really are. In the middle of the night. Cool, sweatin' in my bed. Got the windows open wide. Thinkin' about all the things you said. I wish I could fly out in the blue. Over this town followin' you. I'd fly over rooftops, the great boulevards. To try to find out who you really are, who you really are. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly around and around. Over this town, the dirt on the ground. I'd follow your course of doors left ajar. To try to find out who you really are, who you really are. I'd fly and fly and fly, I wish I could fly. I wake up in a dream in the middle of the night. I wish I could fly, I wish I could flyMadonna. Ray Of Light. Nothing Really Matters. When I was very young. Nothing really mattered to me. But making myself happy. I was the only one. . Now that I am grown. Everything's changed. I'll never be the same. Because of you. . Chorus:. . Nothing really matters. Love is all we need. Everything I give you. All comes back to me. . Looking at my life. It's very clear to me. I lived so selfishly. I was the only one. . I realize. That nobody wins. Something is ending. And something begins. . (chorus, repeat). . Nothing takes the past away. Like the future. Nothing makes the darkness go. Like the light. . You're shelter from the storm. Give me comfort in your arms. . (chorus, repeat and fade)I was her, she was me. We were one, we were free. And if there's somebody calling me on. She's the one. If there's somebody calling me on.

Been hurt in some kind of love affair?. And how many times did you swear. That you'd never love again?. How many lonely, sleepless nights?. How many lies, how many fights?. And why would you want to. Put yourself through all of that again?. Love is pain I hear you say. Love is a cruel and bitter way of. Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain. How could it be that what you need the most. Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?. You never want to feel so sad and lost again. One day you could be looking. Through an old book in rainy weather. You see a picture of her smiling at you. When you were still together. Or you could be walking down the street. And who should you chance to meet?. But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?. Why don't we turn the clock to zero honey. I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money. We're starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock all the way back. I wonder if she'll take me back. I'm thinking in a brand new way. Turn the clock to zero sister. You'll never know how much I missed her. I'm starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock to zero boss. The rivers wide we'll swim across. We're starting up a brand new day. It could happen to you. Just like it happened to me. There is simply no immunity. There's no guarantee. I say love is such a force if you find yourself in it. You need some time for reflection. You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute. Turn the clock to zero honey. I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money. We're starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock to zero Mack. I'm begging her to take me back. I'm thinking in a brand new way. Turn the clock to zero boss. The river's wide we'll swim across. We're starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock to zero buddy. Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy. We're Starting up a brand new day. I'm the rhythm in your tune. I'm the sun and you're the moon. I'm the bat and you're the cave. You're the beach and I'm the wave.

You're the wound and I'm the suture. You're the magnet to my pole. I'm the devil in your soul. You're the pupil I'm the teacher. You're the church and I'm the preacher. You're the flower I'm the rain. You're the tunnel I'm the train. Stand up all you lovers in the world. Stand up and be counted, every boy and every girl. Stand up all you lovers in the world. We're starting up a brand new day. You're the crop to my rotation. You're the sum of my equation. I'm the answer to your question. If you follow my suggestion. We can turn this ship around. We'll go up instead of down. You're the pan and I'm the handle. You're the flame and I'm the candle. I'm the bee and your the flower. You're the princess in the tower. I'm the mast and your the sail.

Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists. I'll let you be my chaperone. (At the halfway home). I'm a full-grown man but I'm not afraid to cry. . Neptune's lips taste like fermented wine. Perfumed blokes on the Ginza line. Running buck wild like a concubine. Who's mother never held her hand. . Brief encounters in Mercedes Benz. Wearing hepatitis contact lens. Bed and breakfast getaway weekends. With Sports Illustrated moms. . I want to defy the logic of all sex laws. Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists. I'll let you be my chaperone. (At the halfway home). I'm a full-grown man but I'm not afraid to cry. . I want to defy the logic of all sex laws. Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists. I'll let you be my chaperone.

I've seen the good side of bad and the down side of up and everything between. I licked the silver spoon, drank from the golden cup and smoked the finest green. I Stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times before I broke their hearts. you know where it is yo, it usually depends on where you start.. I knew this kid Max. He used to get fast stacks out on the corner with drugs. he liked to hang out late at night, liked to get shit faced and keep pace with thugs. Until late one night there was a big gunfight.

Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all his pain. you know it crumbles that way, at least that's what they say when you play the game..

No matter what they try to say. You were always there for me. Someway. When the sun begins to shine. I hear a song from another time. And fade away. And fade away.

And fade away. And fade away. ...You needed me. I cried a tear, you wiped it dry. I was confused, you cleared my mind. I sold my soul, you bought it back for me. And held me up and gave me dignity. Somehow you needed me. You gave me strength to stand alone again. To face the world out on my own again. You put me high upon a pedestal. So high that I could almost see eternity. You needed me, you needed me. And I can't believe it's you, I can't believe it's true. I needed you and you were there. And I'll never leave, why should I leave? I'd be a fool. 'Cause I finally found someone who really cares. You needed me. You held my hand when it was cold. When I was lost, you took me home. You gave me hope when I was at the end. And turned my lies back into truth again. You even called me friend. You gave me strength to stand alone again. To face the world out on my own again. You put me high upon a pedestal. So high that I could almost see eternity. You needed me, you needed me. You needed me, you needed me. Oh, guess you needed me, you needed meSun is shining, the weather is sweet, yeah.
