Once I had a love and it was a gas. Soon turned out had a heart of glass. Seemed like the real thing only to find. Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind. Once I had a love and it was divine. Soon found out I was losing my mind. It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind. Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind. In between 'what I find is pleasing' and 'I'm feeling fine'. Love is so confusing. There's no peace of mind if I fear I'm losing you. It's just no good, you teasing like you do. Once I had a love and it was a gas. Soon turned out had a heart of glass. Seemed like the real thing only to find. Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind. Lost inside adorable illusion. And I cannot hide. I'm the one you're using. Please don't push me aside. We coulda made it cruising, yeah. Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light. Ooh ooh whoa. Ooh ooh whoa. Ooh ooh whoa. Ooh ooh whoa. Once I had a love and it was a gas.

Kept thinking, I could never live without you by my side. But then I spent so many nights thinking, how you did me wrong. And I grew strong and I learned how to get along. And so you're back from outer space. I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face. I should have changed that stupid lock. I should have made you leave your key. If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me. Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now. 'Cause you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?. Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?. Oh, no, not I, I will survive. Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give. And I'll survive, I will survive, hey, hey. It took all the strength I had not to fall apart. Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart. And I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself. I used to cry but now I hold my head up high. And you see me, somebody new. I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you. And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free. But now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me. Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now. 'Cause you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one, who tried to break me with goodbye. Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?. Oh, no, not I, I will survive. Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give. And I'll survive, I will survive, oh. Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now. 'Cause you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one, who tried to break me with goodbye. Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?. Oh, no, not I, I will survive. Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive. I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give.

If you really need me, just reach out and touch me. Come on, honey, tell me so, tell me so, baby. He's acting shy, looking for an answer. Come on honey, let's spend the night together. Now hold on a minute before we go much further. Give me a dime so I can phone my mother. They catch a cab to his high rise apartment. At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant. If you want my body and you think I'm sexy. Come on honey, tell me so. If you really need me, just reach out and touch me. Come on sugar, let me know. His heart's beating like a drum. 'Cause at last he's got this girl home. Relax baby, now we are alone. They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singin'. Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinkin'. Outside it's cold, misty and it's rainin'. They got each other, neither one's complainin'. He say's, "I sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee. Never mind sugar we can watch the early movie".

Me minus you is such a lonely ride. The breakup we had has made me lonesome and sad. I realize I love you. 'Cause I want you bad, hey, hey. I spent the evening with the radio. Regret the moment that I let you go. Our quarrel was such a way of learning so much. I know now that I love you. 'Cause I need your touch, hey, hey. Reunited and it feels so good. Reunited 'cause we understood. There's one perfect fit. And, sugar, this one is it. We both are so excited. 'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey. I sat here staring at the same old wall. Came back to life just when I got your call. I wished I could climb right through the telephone line. And give you what you want. So you will still be mine, hey, hey. I can't go cheating, honey, I can't play. I found it very hard to stay away. As we reminisce on precious moments like this. I'm glad we're back together. 'Cause I missed your kiss, hey, hey.

Ba-a-a-byYou get a shiver in the dark. It's raining in the park but meantime. South of the river you stop and you hold everything. A band is blowing Dixie double four time. You feel alright when you hear that music ring. Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces. Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down. Competition in other places. Ah but the horns, they blowing that sound. Way on down south, way on down south, London town. You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords. Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing. Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford. When he gets up under the lights to play his thing. And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene. He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright. He can play the honky tonk like anything. Saving it up for Friday night. With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing. And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner. Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles. They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band. It ain't what they call rock and roll. Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole. Creole. And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone. And says at last, just as the time bell rings. "Goodnight, now it's time to go home". Then he makes it fast with one more thing. "We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing"Ah ah ah. When I was young it seemed that life was so wonderful. A miracle oh it was beautiful magical. And all the birds in the trees well they'd be singing so happily. Oh joyfully oh playfully watching me. But then they send me away teach me how to be sensible. Logical oh responsible practical. And then they showed me a world where I could be so dependable. Clinical oh intellectual cynical. There are times... when all the world's asleep. The questions run too deep for such a simple man.... Won't you please... please tell me what we've learned?. I know it sounds absurd but please tell me who I am.... I say now watch what you say they'll be calling you a radical liberal oh fanatical criminal. Won't you sign up your name. We'd like to feel you're acceptable respectable oh presentable a vegetable. Oh, ch-ch-check it out yeah. At night when all the world's asleep. The questions run so deep for such a simple man.... Won't you please oh won't you tell me please tell me what we've learned?. Any minuteI know it sounds absurd but please tell me who I am.... Who I am... who I am... who I am.... 'Coz I'm feeling so illogical. D-d-digital. Oh-oh-oh-oh.

Of men who need more than they get. Daylight deals a bad hand. To a woman who has laid too many bets. The mirror stares you in the face and says. "Baby, uh uh, it don't work".

Everybody wants her, everybody loves her. Everybody wants to take your baby home. When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends. (You watch your friends, you better watch your friends). When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends. (Never ends, you know it never ends). You know that is crazy and you wanna trust her. Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone. When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone. Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before. By fair-weather friends and faint-hearted lovers. And every time it happens it just convinces me more. When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes. (Watch her eyes, baby watch her eyes). When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies. (Keep lookin' for lies, baby keep lookin' for eyes). 'Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her. She's the most beautiful woman they know.

How I hate to spend the evening on my own. Autumn winds. Blowing outside my window as I look around the room. And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom. There's not a soul out there. No one to hear my prayer. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Take me through the darkness to the break of the day. Movie stars. Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win. It's so different from the world I'm living in. Tired of TV. I open the window and I gaze into the night. But there's nothing there to see no one in sight. There's not a soul out there. No one to hear my prayer. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Take me through the darkness to the break of the day. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. There's not a soul out there. No one to hear my prayer. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Take me through the darkness to the break of the day. Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight. Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away.

We played the games that people play. We made mistakes along the way. Somehow I know deep in my heart. You needed me. Remembering the pain if I must say. It's deep in my mind and locked away. But then most of all. I do love you still. Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget. Those feelings we can't put aside. For what we had, sometimes I tried to understand. But it's so heavy on the mind. So many dreams that flew away. So many words we didn't say. Two people lost in a storm. Where did we go?. Where'd we go?. We lost what we both had found. You know we let each other down. But then most of all. I do love you still. We played the games that people play. We made our mistakes along the way. Somehow I know deep in my heart. You needed me. 'Cause I needed you so desperately. We were too blind to see. But then most of all. I do love you. StillWe move for all mankind. A million miles from everything we've ever known. We're on their hearts and minds. A million heads are bowed to bring us safely home. Hemmed in by emptiness. A million ways that everything could be undone. This hollow in my chest is filled with reasons. Not to sing but I found one, I know. We are not alone, we feel an unseen love. We are sons and heirs of grace, we are children of. A light that never dims, a love that never dies. Keep your chin up child and wipe the tears from your eyes. In sleep we saw ourselves. A million years we had been waiting there it seems. While someone weaves a spell. A million stars look on in witness to our dreams, I know. We are not alone, we feel an unseen love. We are sons and heirs of grace, we are children of. A light that never dims, a love that never dies. Keep your chin up child and wipe the tears from your eyes. We feel an unseen love. We are children of light. We are not alone, we feel an unseen love. We are sons and heirs of grace, we are children of. A light that never dims, a love that never dies. Keep your chin up child and wipe the tears from your eyes. I stand ready and tall, reflect the lightYou packed in the morning, I stared out the window. And I struggled for something to say. You left in the rain without closing the door. I didn't stand in your way.. Now I miss you more than I, missed you before. And now where I'll find comfort, God knows. 'Cause you left me just when I needed you most. (just when I needed you most). Now most every morning, I stare out the window. And I think about where you might be. I've written you letters that I'd like to send. If you would just send one to me.. 'Cause I need you more than I needed before. And now where I'll find comfort, God knows. 'Cause you left me just when I needed you most. (yoou left me just when I needed you most.). You packed in the morning, I stared out the window. And I struggled for something to say. You left in the rain without closing the door. I didn't stand in your way.. Now I love you more than I loved you before. And now where I'll find comfort, God knows. 'Cause you left me just when I needed you most. Oh yeah, you left me just when I needed you most. You left me just when I needed you most.Baby, I can't figure it out. Your kisses taste like honey. Sweet lies don't gimme no rise. Oh, oh, what you're trying to do?. Livin' on your cheatin' and the pain grows inside me. It's enough to leave me crying in the rain. Love you forever but you're driving me insane. And I'm hanging on. Oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in. Our love has got the power. Too many lovers in one lifetime. Ain't good for you. You treat me like a vision in the night. Someone there to stand behind you. When your world ain't working right. I ain't no vision, I am the man. Who loves you inside out. Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out. I love no other way. What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?. Wrap myself up and take me home again. Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me. I figure it's the love that keeps you warm. Let this moment be forever. We won't ever feel the storm. I ain't no vision, I am the man. Who loves you inside out. Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out. I love no other way. What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?. Don't try to tell me it's all over. I can't hear a word I can't hear a line. No man could love you more and that's what I'm cryin' for. You can't change the way I feel inside. You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow. Blow out the candle, I will burn again tomorrow. No man on earth can stand between my love and I. And no matter how you hurt me I will love you till I die. I ain't no vision, I am the man. Who loves you inside and out. Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out. I love no other way. What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?. Loves you inside and out. Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out. I love no other way. What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?. Loves you inside and out. Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out. I love no other way. What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. Do you feel like you ever want. To try my love and see how well it fits?. Baby, can't you see when you look at me. I can't kick this feelin' when it hits. All alone in my bed at night. I grab my pillow and squezze it tight. I think of you and I dream of you all of the time. What am I gonna do?. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. Sometime, ddon't you feel like you. Never really had a love that's real?. Well, here I am and who's to say. A better love you won't find today. Just one chance and I will show you love. like no other, two steps above. On your ladder I'll be a peg. I want your lovin', please don't make me beg. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I want your love. I need your love. I'll share my dreams and make you see. I'm really there, your love I need. I want your love. I need your love. Just like the birds need sky above. I'll share my dreams and make you see.

I want your loveAlthough the things you've done I wouldn't criticize. I guess you had your way. You see I've gotta make you understand. I know it sounds a foolish thing to say. But it don't matter baby, 'cause today's another day. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life and let me see. Remember, tonight we're gonna run till dawn. Remember, tonight we're gonna say. We'll never stop, we got a good thing goin' on. I know you've heard it all before. But I really need you darlin', every day I need you more. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life and let me see. Can you understand?. (Yes I understand). Can you feel it's right?. (I know it is). Will you be the same?. (I'll do it all again). It's been a year now and it's getting so much better. You came home without a word. Though everybody said you'll soon forget her. They couldn't see and they just didn't understand. And lookin' in the mirror there were fools at either hand. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life. You shine a little love on my life and let me see. Can you understand?. (Yes I understand). Can you feel it's right?. (I know it is). Will you be the same?. (I'll do it all again). How many days had I been waiting there to tell you?. I really can't believe. We're walkin' out into the world tonight.

He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal. When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot.. And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said "Boy, let me tell you what.". "I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too.. And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you.. Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due.. I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.". The boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin,. But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.". Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard.. 'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards.. And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold,. But if you lose the devil gets your soul.. The Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show.". And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow.. And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss.. And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this.. When the Devil finished, Johnny said, "Well, you're pretty good ol' son,. But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.". "Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run!. The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;. Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough.. Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no.. The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.. And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet.. Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again,. 'Cause I've told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.". And he played:. "Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run!. The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;.

A man who was born to be hunted like a wild animal. Because he was poor. But he refused to accept his fate. And today his honor has been restored. He was only nineteen and he was sentenced to die. For something that somebody else did and blamed on El Lute. Then they changed it to life and so he could escape. From then on they chased him and searched for him day and night. All over Spain but the search was in vain for El Lute. He had only seen the dark side of life the man they called El Lute. And he wanted a home just like you and like me. In a country where all would be free. So he taught himself to read and to write it didn't help El Lute. He was one who had dared to escape overnight they had to find El Lute. No one gave you a chance in the Spain of those days. On the walls every place they had put up the face of El Lute. And he robbed where he could just like once Robin Hood. They finally caught him and that seemed the end. But they caught him in vain 'cause a change came for Spain and El Lute. He had only seen the dark side of life the man they called El Lute. And he wanted a home just like you and like me. In a country where all would be free. And then freedom really came to his land and also to El Lute. Now he walks in the light of a sunny new day the man they called El LuteSail on down the line. Bout a half a mile or so. And don't really wanna know. Where you're going. Maybe once or twice you see.

Real-real-real-real. (To be real!). Real-real-real-realWhile she lays sleeping. I stay out late at night and play my songs. And sometimes, all the nights can be so long. And it's good when I finally make it home. All alone. While she lays dreaming. I try to get undressed without the light. And quietly she says, "How was your night?". And I come to her and say, "It was all right". And I hold her tight. And she believes in me. I'll never know just what she sees in me. I told her someday, if she was my girl. I could change the world with my little songs. I was wrong. But she has faith in me. And so I go on trying faithfully. And who knows maybe, on some special night. If my song is right, I will find a way. Find a way. While she lays waiting. I stumble to the kitchen for a bite. Then I see my old guitar in the night. Just waiting for me like a secret friend. And there's no end. While she lays crying. I fumble with a melody or two. And I'm torn between the things that I should do. And she says to wake her up when I am through. God, her love is true. And she believes in me. I'll never know just what she sees in me. I told her someday, if she was my girl. I could change the world with my little songs. I was wrong. But she has faith in me. And so I go on trying faithfully. And who knows maybe, on some special night. If my song is right, I will find a way. While she waits, while she waits for meWhen I met you in the restaurant. You could tell I was no debutante. You asked me what's my pleasure, a movie or a measure. I'll have a cup of tea. . And tell you all my dreaming, dreaming is free. Dreaming, dreaming is free. . I don't want to live on charity. Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?. Reel to reel is living rarity, people stop and stare at me. We just walk on by, we just keep on dreaming. . Feet feet, walking a two mile. Meet meet, meet me at the turnstile. I never met him, I'll never forget him. . Dream dream, even for a little while. Dream dream, filling up an idle hour. Fade away, radiate. . I sit by and watch the river flow. I sit by and watch the traffic go. Imagine something of your very own. Something you can have and hold. I'd build a road in gold. .

London calling to the underworld. Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls. London calling now don't look to us. Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust. London calling see we ain't got no swing. 'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing. The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in. Meltdown expected and the wheat is growing thin. Engines stop running but I have no fear. London is drowning and I live by the river. London calling to the imitation zone. Forget it, brother, you can go it alone. London calling upon the zombies of death. Quit holding out and draw another breath. London calling and I don't wanna shout. But when we were talking I saw you nodding out. London calling see we ain't got no highs. Except for that one with the yellowy eyes. The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in. Engines stop running and the wheat is growing thin. A nuclear error but I have no fear. London is drowning and I, I live by the river. Now get this. London calling yes I was there too. An' you know what they said? Well some of it was true. London calling at the top of the dial. And after all this, won't you give me a smile?. I never felt so much a'like a'like a'likeEvery time I think of you. It always turns out good. Every time I've held you. I thought you understood.

Crazy Little Thing Called Love...Baby you look at me and tell me what you see. You ain't seen the best of me yet. Give me time, I'll make you forget the rest. I've got more in me and you can set it free. I can catch the moon in my hand. Don't you know who I am?. Remember my name. (Fame). I'm gonna live forever. I'm gonna learn how to fly. (High). I feel it coming together. People will see me and cry. (Fame). I'm gonna make it to heaven. Light up the sky like a flame. (Fame). I'm gonna live forever. Baby, remember my name. (Remember, remember, remember, remember). (Remember, remember, remember, remember). Baby hold me tight, 'cause you can make it right. You can shoot me straight to the top. Give me love and take all I've got to give. Baby I'll be tough, too much is not enough, no. I'll grab your heart till it breaks. You got what it takes. (Fame). I'm gonna live forever.

Though it's hurting me, now it's history. I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too. Nothing more to say, no more ace to play. The winner takes it all, the loser standing small. Beside the victory that's her destiny. I was in your arms thinking I belonged there. I figured it made sense building me a fence. Building me a home thinking I'd be strong there. But I was a fool playing by the rules. The Gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice. And someone way down here loses someone dear. The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall. It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain. But tell me does she kiss like I used to kiss you. Does it feel the same, when she calls your name. Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you. But what can I say rules must be obeyed. The judges will decide, the likes of me abide. Spectators of the show always staying low. The game is on again, a lover or a friend. A big thing or a small the winner takes it all. I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad. And I understand you've come to shake my hand. I apologize if it makes you feel bad. Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence. But you see the winner takes it all. The winner takes it all. So the winner takes it all and the loser has to fall. Throw a dice, cold as ice. Way down here, someone dear. Takes it all, has to fall. Yes it's plain, no complainBlondie. Autoamerican. The Tide Is High. The tide is high but I'm holding on. I'm gonna be your number one. I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that oh no. It's not the things you do, that tease and hurt me bad. But it's the way you do the things, you do to me. Every girl wants you to be her man. But I'll wait my dear 'till it's my turnI said-a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie. To the hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock. It to the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie. To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat. Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin' to the beat. And me, the groove and my friends are gonna try to move your feet. See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello. To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow. But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie. Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie. Let's rock, you don't stop. Rock the riddle that will make your body rock. Well, so far youve heard my voice, but I brought two friends along. And next on the mic is my man Hank: come on, Hank, sing that song. Check it out: I'm the C-a-s-an-the-o-v-a, and the rest is f-l-y. Y'see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons, I'll tell ya why:. Y'see I'm six-foot-one and I'm tons of fun, and I dress to a T. Y'see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously. I got bodyguards, I got two big cars that definitely ain't the wack. I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac. So after school, I take a dip in the pool which really is on the wall. I got a color TV, so I can see the Knicks play basketball. Hear me talkin' 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend. But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the rucker, not a dime till I made it again. Y'go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? [(Say what?)]. Y'say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spankin', drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn. Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend. Master Gee, am I mellow?. It's on you, so what you gonna do?. Well, it's on n on n on on n on. The beat don't stop until the break of dawn. I said m-a-s, t-e-r, a g with a double e. I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee. Well, my name is known all over the world. By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls. I'm goin down in history. As the baddest rapper there could ever be. Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows. The beat starts gettin' into your toes. Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet. And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat. And then, damn, ya start doin' the Freak. I said damn, right outta your seat. Then ya throw your hands high in the air. Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere. Ya rockin' to the beat without a care. With the sure shot MCs for the affair. Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang. But I rap to the beat just the same. I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes. All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize. Singin' on n n on n on n on. The beat don't stop until the break of dawn. Singin' on n n on n on on n on. Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie. Pop da pop pop, ya don't dare stop. Come alive, y'all, gimme what ya got. I guess by now, you can take a hunch. And find that I am the baby of the bunch. But that's okay I still keep in stride. 'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind. Singin' on n n on n on n on. The beat don't stop until the break of dawn. Singin' on n n on n on on n on. Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor. I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna feak ya there. I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere. 'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind. I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind. I said 1-2-3-4, come on girls, get on the floor. A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme what ya got. 'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock. I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike, what are you waitin' for?. I said-a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie. The hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock. It to the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie. To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat. Skiddlee beebop-a we rock a scoobie doo. And guess what, America, we love you. 'Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul. You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old. I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast. But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast. Rock it up, baby bubbah. Baby bubbah to the boogie, da bang bang da boogie. To the beat beat, it's so unique. Come on, everybody and dance to the beat. I said-a hip hop, the hippie the hippie. To the hip hip hop-a you dont stop. Rock it out, baby bubbah, to the boogie da bang bang. The boogie to the boogie da beat. I said I can't wait till the end of the week. When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat. And attempt to raise your body heat. Just blow your mind so that you can't speak. And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet. And let it change up to a dance called The Freak. And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat. Rest a little while so ya don't get weak. I know a man named Hank. He has more rhymes than a serious bank. So come on, Hank, sing that song. To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong. Well, I'm imp the dimp, the ladies pimp. The women fight for my delight. But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs. That shock the house for the young ladies. And when you come inside into the front. You do the freak, spank, and do the bump. And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point. We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint. A-from sun-to-sun and from day-to-day. I sit down and write a brand new rhyme. Because they say that miracles never cease. I've created a devastating masterpiece. I'm gonna rock the mic till you can't resist. Everybody, I say, it goes like this:. Well, I was comin' home late one dark afternoon. A reporter stopped me for a interview. She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables. That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables. This young reporter, I did adore. So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before. She said, "Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you!. The Cassanova legend must have been true!". I said, "By the way, baby, what's your name?". Said, "I go by the name of Lois Lane. And you could be my boyfiend, you surely can. Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman". I said, "He's a fairy, I do suppose. Flyin' through the air in pantyhose. He may be very sexy or even cute. But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit". I said, "You need a man who's got finesse. And his whole name across his chest. He may be able to fly all through the night. But can he rock a party till the early light?. He can't satisfy you with his little worm. But I can bust you out with my super sperm!". I gon' do it, I gon' do it. I gon' do it, do it, do it. And I'm here, and I'm there. I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere. Just throw your hands up in the air. And party hardy like you just don't care. Let's do it, don't stop y'all. A-tick a-tock, y'all, you don't stop!. Go hotel, motel, what you gonna do today? [(Say what?)]. I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn. You say, if your girl starts actin' up then you take her friend. I say skip, dive, what can I say?. I can't fit em all inside my OJ. So I just take half and bust them out. I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house. It was twelve o'clock one Friday night. I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right. Everybody was dancin' on the floor. Doin' all the things they never did before. And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean. She came into the bar, she came into the scene. As she traveled deeper inside the room. All the fellas checked out her white sasoons. She came up to the table, looked into my eyes. Then she turned around and shook her behind. So I said to myself, "It's time for me to release. My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece". And now, people in the house, this is just for you. A little rap to make you boogaloo. Now the group ya hear is called phase two. And let me tell ya somethin', we're a helluva crew. Once a week we're on the street. Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free. For you to party, ya got to have the moves. So we'll get right down and give you a groove. For you to dance, you gotta get hype. So we'll get right down and make you rock. Now the system's on and the girls are there. Ya definitely have a rockin affair. But let me tell ya somethin', there's still one fact:. That to have a party, ya got to have a rap. So when the party's over, you're makin' it home. And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn. And while ya sleepin', ya start to dream. And thinkin' how ya danced on the disco scene. My name appears in your mind. Yeah, a name you know that was right on time. It was phase two, just a-doin' a do. Rockin' ya down 'cause ya know we could. To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak. Come alive, girls, get on your feet. To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat. To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak. To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on. On n on into the break of dawn. Now I got a man comin' on right now. He's guaranteed to throw down. He goes by the name of Wonder Mike. Come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like. Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey. Like a millionaire that has no money. Like a rainy day that is not wet. Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet. Like Dracula without his fangs. Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang. Like collard greens that don't taste good. Like a tree that's not made out of wood. Like goin' up and not comin' down. Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound. To the beat beat, ya do The Freak. Everybody just rock and dance to the beat. Have you ever went over a friends house to eat. And the food just ain't no good?. I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed. And the chicken tastes like wood. So you try to play it off like you think you can. By sayin that you're full. And then your friend says, "Momma, he's just being polite. He ain't finished, uh uh, that's bull!". So your heart starts pumpin', and you think of a lie. And you say that you already ate. And your friend says, "Man, there's plenty of food!". So you pile some more on your plate. While the stinky foods steamin' your mind starts to dreamin'. Of the moment that it's time to leave. And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin'. Into something that looks like cheese. Oh so, you say, "That's it, I got to leave this place. I don't care what these people think. I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous. With this ugly food that stinks!". So you bust out the door while it's still closed. Still sick from the food you ate. And then you run to the store for quick relief. From a bottle of Kaopectate. And then you call your friend two weeks later. To see how he has been. And he says, "I understand about the food, baby bubbah. But we're still friends". With a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie. The hip hip-a hop-a you don't stop the rockin'. To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie. To the rhythm of the boogie the beat. I say, Hank, can ya rock?. Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?. Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?. I said, come on make the, make the people move. I go to the halls and then ring the bell. Because I am the man with the clientele. And if ya ask me why I rock so well. A big bang, I got clientele. And from the time I was only six years old. I never forgot what I was told. It was the best advice that I ever had. It came from my wise dear old dad. He said, "Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you. And don't say a word until I'm through. Now, there's a time to laugh, a time to cry. A time to live and a time to die. A time to break and a time to chill. To act civilized or act real ill. But whatever ya do in your lifetime. Y'never let a MC steal your rhyme!". So from sixty-six to this very day. I'll always remember what he had to say. So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style. I let them know that I'm versatile. I got style, finesse and a little black book. That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look. But there's a thing that separates you from me. And that is called originality. Because my rhymes are on from what you heard. I didn't even bite and not a Goddamn word. And I say a little more later on tonight. So the sucker MCs can bite all night. A-tick a-tock y'all, a-beat beat y'all. A-let's rock y'all, ya don't stop. Ya go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? [(Say what?)]. Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spankin'. Drive off in a def OJ. Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn. Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends. A-like that y'all, to the beat y'all. Beat beat ya'll, ya don't stop. A-Master Gee, am I mellow?. It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?. Well, like Johnny Carson on The Late Show. A-like Frankie Crocker in stereo. Well, like The Bar-Kay's singin' Holy Ghost. The sounds to throw down, they're played the most. It's like my man, Captain Sky. Whose name he earned with his super sperm. We rock and we don't stop. Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got. To the beat that it makes you freak. And come alive, girl, get on your feet. A-like a Perry Mason without a case. Like Farrah Fawcett without her face. Like The Bar-Kays on the mic. Like gettin' right down for you tonight. Like movin' your body so ya don't know how. Right to the rhythm and throw down. Like comin' alive to the Master Gee. The brother who rocks so viciously. I said, the age of one, my life begun. At the age of two, I was doin the' do. At the age of three, it was you and me. Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee. At the age of four, I was on the floor. Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for. At the age of five, I didn't take no jive. With the Master Gee, it's all the way live. At the age of six, I was a-pickin' up sticks. Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed. At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven. Dontcha know I went off?. I got right on down to the beat, you see. Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls. Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat. To the double beat beat that makes you freak. At the age of eight, I was really great. 'Cause every night, you see I had a date. At the age of nine, I was right on time. 'Cause every night, I had a party rhyme. Goin' on n n on n on on n on. The beat don't stop until the break of dawn. A-sayin' on n n on n on on n on.... Like a hot buttered de pop de pop de pop. A-saying on n n on n on on n on. 'Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic. I am the definite feast delight. 'Cause I'm a helluva man when i'm on the miC. I am the definite feast delight.

Feeling like a number oneEveryone considered him the coward of the county. He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong.. His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow,. Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong.. He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison;. I took care of Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son.. I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy,. "Son my life is over, but yours has just begun".. "Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done. Walk away from trouble if you can.. It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope you're old enough to understand,. Son, you don't have to fight to be a man.". There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky.. In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man.. One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling. They took turns at Becky, (and there was three of them).. Tommy opened up the door, and saw Becky crying.. The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand.. He reached above the fireplace, and took down his daddy's picture.. As the tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:. "Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done. Walk away from trouble if you can.. It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope you're old enough to understand,. Son, you don't have to fight to be a man.. The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom;. One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor.. When Tommy turned around they said, "Hey look! old yeller's leaving,". But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door.. Twenty years of crawling were bottled up inside him.. He wasn't holding nothing back -- he let 'em have it all.. When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing.. He said, "This one's for Becky, as he watched the last one fall. (And I heard him say,). "I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done. I walk away from trouble when I can. Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek,. And papa, I should hope you understand. Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man".. Everyone considered him the coward of the county.Cars. Here in my car. I feel safest of all. I can lock all my doors. It's the only way to live.

Starring my idol, Marlon Brando. And I felt a yearning for that great adventure. So many nights I woke up out of a dream. A dream of blue seas, white sands,. Paradise birds, butterflies and beautiful warm-hearted girls. Sun of Jamaica, the dreams of Malaika. Our love is my sweet memory. Sun of Jamaica, Blue Lady Malaika. Some day I'll return, wait and see. Walk in the sand and I'm happy with you. We shall be loving and true. Oh I sure love Malaika. With all of my heart. I will always be faithful and true, yeah true. But now as I grew older. This buring desire became so strong. That I bought me a ticket to fly over there. And then I found you. And we found an eternal love right from the beginning. Stars falling down from the sleepy lagoon. Palms swaying under the moon. We were swimming out into the calm, crystal sea. In that fateful night I thought to myself. I'll do everything I can, save every dime. And one day I'll return, come back home to you. And then I'll stay forever, forever. Sun of Jamaica, the dreams of Malaika. Our love is my sweet memory. Sun of Jamaica, Blue Lady Malaika. Some day I'll return, wait and see. Walk in the sand and I'm happy with you. We shall be loving and true. Oh I sure love Malaika. With all of my heart. I will always be faithful and true, yeah trueWhenever dark has fallen. You know the spirit of the party. Starts to come alive. Until the day is dawning. You can throw out all your blues. And hit the city lights. 'Cause there's music in the air. And lots of lovin' everywhere. So give me the night, give me the night. You need the evening action. A place to dine, a glass of wine. A little late romance. It's a chain reaction. You'll see the people of the world. Coming out to dance. 'Cause there's music in the air. And lots of lovin' everywhere. So give me the night, give me the night. So come on out tonight. And we'll lead the others. On a ride through paradise. And if you feel all right. Then we can be lovers 'cause I see. That starlight look in your eyes. Don't you know we can fly?. Just give me the night. Give me the night. 'Cause there's music in the air. And lots of lovin' everywhere. So give me the night, give me the night. So come on out tonight. And we'll lead the others. On a ride through paradise. And if you feel all right. Then we can be lovers 'cause I see. That starlight look in your eyes. Don't you know we can fly?. And if we stay together. We'll feel the rhythm of the evening. Taking us up high. Never mind the weather. We'll be dancing in the street. Until the morning light. 'Cause there's music in the air. And lots of lovin' everywhere. So give me the night. Give me the night. Give me the night. Give me the night...I'm lying alone with my head on the phone. Thinking of you till it hurts. I know you hurt too but what else can we do?. Tormented and torn apart. I wish I could carry your smile in my heart. For times when my life seems so low. It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring. When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know. I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you. I know you were right, believing for so long. I'm all out of love, what am I without you?. I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong. I want you to come back and carry me home. Away from these long lonely nights. I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too?. Does the feeling seem oh so right?. And what would you say if I called on you now. Saying that I can't hold on?. There's no easy way, it gets harder each day. Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone. I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you. I know you were right, believing for so long. I'm all out of love, what am I without you?. I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong. (What are you thinking of?). What are you thinking of?. (What are you thinking of?). What are you thinking of?. I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you. I know you were right believing for so long. I'm all out of love, what am I without you?. I can't be too late, I know I was so wrong. I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you. I know you were right believing for so long. I'm all out of love, what am I without you?. I can't be too late, I know I was so wrong. I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you. I know you were right, believing for so long. I'm all out of love, what am I without you?. I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong.   (I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you, I know you were right)Do you remember a guy that's been. In such an early song. I've heard a rumor from ground control. Oh no, don't say it's true. They got a message from the action man. "I'm happy, hope you're happy too. I've loved all I've needed love. Sordid details following". The shrieking of nothing is killing. Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I. Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair. But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing. Ashes to ashes, funk to funky. We know Major Tom's a junkie. Strung out in Heaven's high. Hitting an all-time low. Time and again I tell myself. I'll stay clean tonight. But the little green wheels are following me. Oh no, not again. I'm stuck with a valuable friend. "I'm happy, hope you're happy too". One flash of light but no smoking pistol. I've never done good things. I've never done bad things. I never did anything out of the blue. Want an axe to break the ice. Wanna come down right now. Ashes to ashes, funk to funky. We know Major Tom's a junkie. Strung out in Heaven's high. Hitting an all-time low. My mother said, "To get things done. You'd better not mess with Major Tom". My mother said, "To get things done. You'd better not mess with Major Tom". My mother said, "To get things done. You'd better not mess with Major Tom". My mother said, "To get things done. You'd better not mess with Major Tom"I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long. Like a worn-out recording of a favorite song. So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed. And in the personals column there was this letter I read. "If you like Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain. If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain. If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape. I'm the lady you've looked for, write to me and escape". I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean. But me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine. So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad. And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half-bad. "Yes, I like Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain. I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne. I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape. At a bar called O'Malley's, where we'll plan our escape". So I waited with high hopes then she walked in the place. I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face. It was my own lovely lady and she said, "Oh, it's you". And we laughed for a moment and I said, "I never knew". "That you liked Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain. And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne. If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape. You're the love that I've looked for, come with me and escape". "If you like Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain. And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne. If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape. You're the love that I've looked for, come with me and escape"LOVE ON THE ROCKS. Neil Diamond. Love on the rocks. Ain't no surprise. Pour me a drink. And I'll tell you some lies. Got nothin' to lose.

Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?. "Welcome back to the age of jive.. Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?. You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.". Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound. Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me. What's the matter with the car I'm driving?. "Can't you tell that it's out of style?". Should I get a set of while wall tires?. "Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?. Nowadays you can't be too sentimental. Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.". Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk. It's still rock and roll to me. Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers. 'Cause it's always been the same old scene.. There's a new band in town. But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine.... Aimed at your average teen. How about a pair of pink sidewinders. And a bright orange pair of pants?.

Should I try to be a straight `A' student?. "If you are then you think too much.. Don't you know about the new fashion honey?. All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.". It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways. It's still rock and roll to me. Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound. Funny, but it's still rock and roll to meStart spreadin' the news.

It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat. They never said your name. But I knew just who they meant.. Whoa I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered, too. If by chance you heard it for yourself. I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you. But they said it really loud, they said it on the air. On the radio. Whoa, oh, oh. On the radio. Whoa oh oh oh. On the radio. Whoa, oh, oh. On the radio. Whoa, oh, oh. Now, now. Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song. Things are not the same since we broke up last June. The only thing that I want to hear is that you love me still. And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon. Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah. And it made me feel proud when I heard you say. You couldn't find the words to say it yourself. And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel. 'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air. On the radio. Whoa, oh, oh. On the radio. Whoa, oh, oh. On the radio. Whoa, oh, oh. On the radio. Whoa oh oh. On the radio. If you think that love isn't found on the radio. Well tune right in you made find the love you lost. 'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago. It sounded really loud, they said it really loud. On the radio. Whoa, oh, oh. On the radio. Whoa, oh, oh. On the radio. Whoa, oh, oh. On the radio. Whoa, oh, oh. On the radioCome bring me your softness. Comfort me through all this madness. Woman, don't you know, with you I'm born again. Come give me your sweetness. Now there's you, there is no weakness. Lying safe within your arms, I'm born again. I was half, not whole. Instead with none. Reaching through this world. In need of one. Come show me your kindness.

And we're changing our ways, taking different roads. Then love, love will tear us apart again. Love, love will tear us apart again. Why is the bedroom so cold turned away on your side?. Is my timing that flawed our respect run so dry?. Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives. But love, love will tear us apart again. Love, love will tear us apart again. Do you cry out in your sleep all my failings exposed?. And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold. Is it something so good just can't function no more?. When love, love will tear us apart again. Love, love will tear us apart again. Love, love will tear us apart again. Love, love will tear us apart againSome say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed. Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed. Some say love, it is a hunger an endless aching need. I say love, it is a flower and you, it's only seed. It's the heart, afraid of breaking that never learns to dance. It's the dream, afraid of waking that never takes the chance. It's the one who won't be taken who cannot seem to give. And the soul, afraid of dying that never learns to live. When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long. And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong. Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snow. Lies the seed that with the sun's love, in the spring becomes the roseMake me tonight. Tonight make it right. Make me tonight. Tonight, tonight. Make it magnificent. Tonight right. Oh your hair is beautiful. Oh, tonight. Atomic. Tonight make it magnificent. Tonight make me tonight. Your hair is beautiful. Oh, tonight. Atomic, atomic, oh.

Now it's not like me to say the right thing. But you could'nt called to let me know. I checked your number twice, don't understand it. So I went home. Well I'd been waiting for this weekend. I thought that may be we could see a show. Never dreamed I'd have this feeling. Oh but seeing you is believing. That's why I don't know why. You didn't show up that night. There must be some misunderstanding. There must be some kind of mistake. I was waiting in the rain for hours, you were late. Since then I've been runnin' around tryin' to find you.

Can't you hear it coming your way, it's here to stay.. Music in our walk, music when we talk.. It's really something magic, to lose it would be tragic.. Can't you feel the sound movin' through the ground?. Music makes the world go around.. You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.. Take the cold from snow, tell the trees, don't grow,.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.. Take the heat from flame, try not feeling pain,. Though you try in vain it's much easier.. No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.. Change the master plan, take the hope from man. 'cause that's easier to do.. On the radio, on every TV show.

Separated by fools. Who don't know what love is yet. But I want you to know. If I could fly, I'd pick you up. I'd take you into the night. And show you a love. Like you've never seen, ever seen. It's like having a dream. Where nobody has a heart. It's like having it all. And watching it fall apart. And I would wait till the end of time for you. And do it again, it's true. I can't measure my love. There's nothing to compare it to. But I want you to know. If I could fly, I'd pick you up. I'd take you into the night. And show you a love. Ooh, if I could fly. I'd pick you up. I'd take you into the night. And show you a love. Like you've never seen, ever seen. Yeah, oohI know you come a long way, baby. But you don't need that heart of stone, no.

(The second time around). And I'll make it better than the first time. You know I really love you. And I paid for my mistakes, yes, I did, girl. The more I try to hide my feelings, baby. This old heart gets in the way. And love won't let me wait. (The second time around). Girl, with me it's better than the first time. (The second time around). Let's do it one more time, say it again.

She'll say, oh, he's just a friend and I'll say, oh, I'm not blind to. Him, him, him, what's she gonna do about him. She's gonna have to do without him. It's him or it's me, me, me. No one gets to get it for free, it's me or it's him. Don't know what he looks like, don't know who he is. Don't know why she thought that I would say what's mine is his. I don't want to own her but I can't let her have it both ways. Three is one too many of us, she leaves with me or stays with. Him, him, him, what's she gonna do about him. She's gonna have to live without him. It's him or it's me, me, me. No one gets to get it for free, it's me or it's him. If she wants him she can have him. Just exactly how we once were. It's goodbye to he and I. Back to me and her, without. Him, him, him, what's she gonna do about him. She's gonna have to do without him. Or do without me, me, me. No one gets to get it for free. Time for me to make the girl see. It's me or it's him, him, him, what's she gonna do about him. She's gonna have to do without him. Or do without me, me, me. No one gets to get it for free. Time for me to make the girl see, it's me or it's himWait a minute, baby. Stay with me awhile. Said you'd give me light. But you never told me about the fire. Drowning in the sea of love. Where everyone would love to drown. But now it's gone. It doesn't matter what for. When you build your house. Then call me home. And he was just like a great dark wing. Within the wings of a storm. I think I had met my match, he was singing. And undoing and undoing the laces. Undoing the laces. Said Sara, "You're the poet in my heart. Never change, never stop. But now it's gone. It doesn't matter what for. But when you build your house. Well, then call me home". Hold on, the night is coming. And the starling flew for days. I'd stay at home at night all the time. I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere. Ask me and I'm there, yeah, ask me. And I'm there because I care. In the sea of love. Where everyone would love to drown. But now it's gone. They say it doesn't matter any more. If you build your house then please call me. Ho Sarah, you're the poet in my heart. Never change and don't you ever stop. And now it's gone. No, it doesn't matter any more. When you build your house, I'll come by. Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. ...Seems like yesterday. But it was long ago. Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights. There in the darkness with the radio playing low and the secrets that we shared. Mountains that we moved. Caught like a wildfire out of control. 'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove. And I remember what she said to me. How she swore that it never would end. I remember how she held me oh so tight. Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then. Against the wind. We were runnin' against the wind. We were young and strong we were runnin'. Against the wind. The years rolled slowly past. And I found myself alone. Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends. Found myself further and further from my home and I guess I lost my way. There were oh so many roads. I was living to run and running to live. Never worried about paying or even how much I owed. Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time. Breaking all of the rules that would bend. I began to find myself searching. Searching for shelter again and again. Against the wind. Little something against the wind. I found myself seeking shelter. Against the wind. Well those drifter's days are past me now. I've got so much more to think about. Deadlines and commitments. What to leave in what to leave out. Against the wind. I'm still runnin' against the wind. I'm older now but still runnin' against the wind. Well I'm older now and still runnin'. Against the wind. Against the wind. Against the wind. Still runnin'. (against the wind). I'm still runnin' against the wind. (against the wind). I'm still runnin'. (against the wind). I'm still runnin' against the wind. (against the wind). Still runnin'. (against the wind). Runnin' against the wind runnin' against the wind. (against the wind). See the young man run. (against the wind). Watch the young man run. (against the wind). Watch the young man runnin'. (against the wind). He'll be runnin' against the wind. (against the wind). Let the cowboys ride. (against the wind). A-a-a-a-h.... (against the wind). Let the cowboys ride. (against the wind). They'll be ridin' against the wind. (against the wind). Against the wind .... (against the wind). Ridin' against the wind. (against the wind). (against the wind).

Somehow I knew it would be you. To change my gray skies to blue. And it was strange when you called my name. Ever since that day I haven't been the same, ooh. Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine. Then all of a sudden you slipped up from behind. Pop (Pop) went the reason in my mind. A sweet special lady. And a very exciting girl (ooh, so exciting). You gotta be a special lady (what a lady). 'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world. Sittin' on top of the world. I was like a song so out of key. Then you came and gave my soul a melody. Thanks to you, for pullin' me through. I've always lost but now I win with you. Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine. Then all of a sudden you slipped up from behind. Pop (pop) went the reason in my mind. (You must be a special lady) you're a lady. (And a very exciting girl) so exciting, woo.

To be free again. And I've got such a long way to go. To make it to the border of Mexico. So I'll ride like the wind. Ride like the wind. I was born the son of a lawless man. Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand. Lived nine lives. Gunned down ten. Gonna ride like the wind. And I've got such a long way to go. To make it to the border of Mexico. So I'll ride like the wind. Ride like the wind. Accused and tried and told to hang. I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang. Never was the kind to do as I was told. Gonna ride like the wind before I get old. It is the night. My body's weak. I'm on the run. No time to sleep. I've got to ride. Ride like the wind. To be free again. And I've got such a long way to go. To make it to the border of Mexico. So I'll ride like the wind. Ride like the windShe's out of my life, she's out of my life. And I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I don't know whether to live or die. And it cuts like a knife, she's out of my life. It's out of my hands, it's out of my hands. To think for two years she was here. And I took her for granted I was so cavalier. Now the way that it stands, she's out of my hands. So I've learned that love's not possession. And I've learned that love won't wait. Now I've learned that love needs expression. But I've learned too late and. She's out of my life, she's out of my life. Damned indecision and cursed pride. Kept my love for her locked deep inside. And it cuts like a knife, she's out of my lifeJeux Sans Frontières. Jeux Sans Frontières. Jeux Sans Frontières. Jeux Sans Frontières.

Oh, lover, yeah, I wanna be the only one you come for, yeahI'm alive and the world shines for me today. I'm alive, suddenly I am here today. Seems like forever (and a day). Thought I could never (feel this way). Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive. I'm alive and the dawn breaks across the sky. I'm alive and the sun rises up so high. Lost in another world (far away). Never another word (till today). But what can I say? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive. Suddenly came the dawn from the night. Suddenly I was born into light. How can it be real? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive. I'm alive and the world shines for me today. I'm alive, suddenly I am here today. Seems like forever (and a day). Thought I could never (feel this way).

Longer than there've been stars up in the Heavens. I've been in love with you. Stronger than any mountain cathedral. Truer than any tree ever grew. Deeper than any forest primeval. I am in love with you. I'll bring fires in the winters. You'll send showers in the springs. We'll fly through the falls and summers. With love on our wings. Through the years as the fire starts to mellow. Burning lines in the book of our lives. Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow. I'll be in love with you, I'll be in love with you. Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean. Higher than any bird ever flew. Longer than there've been stars up in the Heavens. I've been in love with you, I am in love with youFirst thing I remember. I was lying in my bed. Couldn't've been no more. Than one or two. I remember there's a radio. Comin' from the room next door. And my mother laughed. The way some ladies do. When it's late in the evening. And the music's seeping through. The next thing I remember. I am walking down the street. I'm feeling all right. I'm with my boys. I'm with my troops, yeah. And down along the avenue. Some guys were shootin' pool. And I heard the sound of a cappella groups, yeah. Singing late in the evening. And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah. Then I learned to play some lead guitar. I was underage in this funky bar. And I stepped outside to smoke myself a "J". And when I came back to the room. Everybody just seemed to move. And I turned my amp up loud and began to play. And it was late in the evening. And I blew that room away. First thing I remember. When you came into my life. I said, "I'm gonna get that girl. No matter what I do". Well, I guess I'd been in love before. And once or twiceI'd been on the floor. But I never loved no one. The way I loved you. And it was late in the evening. And all the music seeping throughOoh, Ooh. Yeah, Yeah. I'm in the mood for dancing, romancing. Ooh I'm giving it all tonight. I'm in the mood for chancing.

I've been wondering why. Still somehow I believed. We'd always survive. Now I'm not so sure. You're waiting to hear. One good reason to try. But what more can I say?. What's left to provide?. You think that maybe it's over. Only if you want it to be. Are you gonna wait for your sign, your miracle?. Stand up and fight. (This is it). Make no mistake where you are.   (This is it). Your back's to the corner. (This is it). Don't be a fool anymore.   (This is it). The waiting is over. No room to run, no way to hide. No time for wondering why. It's here, the moment is now. About to decide. Let him believe or leave him behind. But keep me near in your heart. And know, whatever you do. I'm here by your side. You said that maybe it's over. Not if you don't want it to be. For once in your life, here's your miracle. Stand up and fight. (This is it). Make no mistake where you are.   (This is it). You're going no further. (This is it). Until it's over and done.

Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead. It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by. Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly. 'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight. The moment that he's with me, everything's alright. Night time is the right time, we make love. Then it's his and my time, we take off. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant. To go slow dancing, anything I want. Only when he's with me, I catch light. Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly. I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me). When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight. Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night. My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five and then. He takes another home again. To find me waitin' for him. (My baby takes the morning train). He's always on that morning train. (He works from nine to five and then). He works so hard. (He takes another home again). To find me waiting for him. (My baby takes the morning train). (He works from nine to five and then). (He takes another home again). (To find me waitin' for him)Once in your life you find her. Someone that turns your heart around. And next thing you know you're closing down the town. Wake up and it's still with you. Even though you left her way across town. Wondering to yourself, "Hey, what've I found?". When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do is fall in love. Arthur he does as he pleases. All of his life, he's master's choice. Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy. Living his life one day at a time. He's showing himself a really good time. He's laughing about the way they want him to be. When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do is fall in love. When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do is fall in love. When you get caught between the Moon and New York City. I know it's crazy but it's true. If you get caught between the Moon and New York City. The best that you can do. The best that you can do is fall in loveTumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen. Pour myself a cup of ambition. And yawnin', stretchin', try to come to life. Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'. Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'. With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5. Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'. Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'. They just use your mind and they never give you credit. It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it. 9 to 5, for service and devotion. You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion. Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me. I swear sometimes that man is out to get me. They let your dream, just watch 'em shatter. You're just a step on the boss man's ladder. But you got dreams he'll never take away. In the same boat with a lot of your friends. Waitin' for the day your ship 'll come in. And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll you away. Workin' 9 to 5 what a way to make a livin'. Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'. They just use your mind and you never get the credit. It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it. 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you. There's a better life and you think about it, don't you?. It's a rich man's game, no matter what they call it. And you spend your life putting money in his wallet. Workin' 9 to 5, oh what a way to make a livin'. Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'. They just use you mind and they never give you credit. It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it. 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you. There's a better life and you think about it, don't you?. It's a rich man's game, no matter what they call it. And you spend your life putting money in his walletToe to toe, dancing very close. Body breathing, almost comatose. Wall to wall, people hypnotized. And they're stepping lightly. Hang each night, in Rapture. Back to back, sacroiliac. Spineless movement and a wild attack. Face to face, sightless solitude. And it's finger popping. Twenty four hour shopping in Rapture. Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly. D.J. spinning, I said, "My my". Flash is fast, flash is cool. Francois, c'est pas flashe non due. And you don't stop, sure shot. Go out to the parking lot. And you get in your car and drive real far. And you drive all night and then you see a light. And it comes right down and it lands on the ground. And out comes the man from Mars. And you try to run but he's got a gun. And he shoots you dead and he eats your head. And then you're in the man from Mars. You go out at night eating cars. You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too. Mercurys and Subaru. And you don't stop, you keep on eating cars. Then when there's no more cars you go out at night. And eat up bars, where the people meet. Face to face, dance cheek to cheek. One to one, man to man, dance toe to toe, don't move too slow. 'Cause the man from Mars, is through with cars. He's eating bars,yeah, wall to wall. Door to door, hall to hall, he's gonna eat 'em all, Rapture, be pure. Take a tour through the sewer. Don't strain your brain. Paint a train, you'll be singing in the rain. Said don't stop to the punk rock. Back to back, body muscular. Spinless movement, bite the jugular. One to one, tea time technology. And a  digital ardour, no sign of saviour in Rapture. Well now you see what you wanna be, just have your party on T.V. 'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the T.V's on. And now he's gone, back up to space. Where he won't have a hassle with the human race. And you hip hop, and you don't stop. Just blast off, sure shot. 'Cause the man from Mars stopped eating cars. And eating bars, and now he only eats guitars, get upFor your eyes only can see me through the night. For your eyes only, I never need to hide. You can see so much in me, so much in me that's new. I never felt till I looked at you. For your eyes only, only for you. You'll see what no-one else can see and now I'm breaking free. For your eyes only, only for you. The love I know you need in me, the fantasy you've freed in me. Only for you, only for you. For your eyes only, the nights are never cold. You really know me, that's all I need to know. Maybe I'm an open book because I know you're mine. But you won't need to read between the lines. For your eyes only, only for you. You see what no-one else can see and now I'm breaking free. For your eyes only, only for you. The passions that collide in me, the wild abandoned side of me. Only for you, for your eyes onlyYou should have seen by the. Look in my eyes baby. There was something missin'. You should have know by the. Tone of my voice maybe. But you didn't listen. You played dead. But you never bled. Instead you laid still in the grass. All coiled up and hissin'. You know I know. All about those men. Still I don't remember. 'Cause it was us baby. Way before them. And we're still together. And I meant every word I said. When I said that I loved you. I meant that I love you forever. And i'm gonna keep on lovin' you. Cause it's the only thing I wanna do. I don't wanna sleep. I just wanna keep on lovin' you. And I meant every word I said. When I said that I love you. I meant that I love you forever. And i'm gonna keep on lovin' you. Cause it's the only thing i wanna do. I don't wanna sleep. I just wanna keep on lovin' you. Baby, I'm gonna keep on lovin' you. Cause it's the only thing I wanna do.

You got me tickin' gonna blow my top. If you start me up. I'll never stop. You make a grown man cry. You make a grown man cry. You make a grown man cry. Spread out the oil, the gasoline. I walk smooth, ride in a mean. Mean machine. Start it up. If you start me up. Kick on the starter give it all you got. I can't compete. With the riders in the other heats. If you tough it up. If you like it you can slide it up. If you start me up. I'll never stop. Don't make a grown man cry. Don't make a grown man cry. Don't make a grown man cry. My eyes dilate, my lips go green.

I've been looking too hard, I've waiting too long. Sometimes I don't know what I will find. I only know it's a matter of time. When you love someone. When you love someone. It feels so right, so warm and true. I need to know if you feel it too. Maybe I'm wrong. Won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong. This heart of mine has been hurt before. This time I want be be sure. I've been waiting for a girl like you. To come into my life. I've been waiting for a girl like you. A love that will survive. I've been waiting for someone new.

Every little thing she does is magic. Everything she do just turn me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Well I had to tell the story. Of a thousand rainy days since we first met. It's a big enough umbrella. But it's always me that ends up getting wet. Every little thing she does is magic. Everything she do just turn me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. I resolve to call her up. A thousand times in day. And ask her if she'll marry me. In some old fashioned way. But my silent fears have gripped me. Long before I reach the phone. And before my tongue has tricked me. Must I always be alone?. Every little thing she does is magic.

Jessie's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine. And she's watching him with those eyes. And she's loving him with that body, I just know it. Yeah 'n' he's holding her in his arms late, late at night. You know. I wish that I had Jessie's girl. I wish that I had Jessie's girl. Where can I find a woman like that. I play along with the charade. There doesn't seem to be a reason to change. You know, I feel so dirty when they start talking cute. I wanna tell her that I love her,. But the point is probably moot.

Puts people on streets. It's the terror of knowing. What this world is about. Watching some good friends. Screaming get me out. Tomorrow takes me higher. Pressure on people. People on streets. Day day day. Okay. Chippin' around. Kick my brains round the floor. These are the days. It never rains but it pours. People on streets. People on streets. It's the terror of knowing. What this world is about. Watching some good friends. Screaming let me out. Tomorrow takes me high, high, higher. Pressure on people. People on streets. Turned away from it all. Like the blind man. Sat on a fence but it don't work. Keep coming up with love. But it's so slashed and torn. Why why why?. Love, love, love, love. Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking. Can't we give ourselves one more chance?. Why can't we give love that one more chance?. Why can't we give love give love give love?. Give love, give love, give love. Give love, give love, give love?. 'Cause love's such an old fashioned word. And love dares you to care. For the people on the edge of the night. And love dares you to change our way. Of caring about ourselves. This is our last dance. This is our last dance. This is ourselves. Under pressure. Under pressure. PressureDon't think me unkind. Words are hard to find. They're only cheques I've left unsigned.

Their innocence will pull me through. De do do do, de da da da. Is all I want to say to you. De do do do, de da da da. They're meaningless and all that's true. Poets, priests and poiticians. Have words to thank for their positions. Words that scream for your submission. And no-one's jamming their transmission. And when their eloquence escapes you. Their logic ties you up and rapes you. De do do do, de da da da. Is all I want to say to you. De do do do, de da da da. Their innocence will pull me through. De do do do, de da da da. Is all I want to say to you. De do do do, de da da da.

Now in the world of light where the spirit free of the lies. And all else that we despised, they've forgotten all about God. He's the only reason we exist, yet you were the one. That they said was so weird. . All those years ago, you said it all though not many had ears. All those years ago, you had control of our smiles and our tears.

My picture clear, everything seemed so easy. And so I dealt you the blow. One of us had to go. Now it's different, I want you to know. One of us is crying. One of us is lying in her lonely bed. Staring at the ceiling. Wishing she was somewhere else instead. One of us is lonely. One of us is only waiting for a call. Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small. Wishing she had never left at all. I saw myself as a concealed attraction. I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action. Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving.

Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling smallMy friends wonder why I call you all of the time. What can I say. I don't feel the need to give such secrets away. You think maybe I need help, no I know I'm right all right. I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice. When they insist on blowing my bliss. I tell them this.

Patti packed her bags, left a note for her momma. She was just seventeen. There were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye. . They held each other tight as they drove on through the night. They were so exited. We got just one shot of life, let's take it while we're still not afraid. Because life is so brief and time is a thief when you're undecided. And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands. . Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side. Don't let them put you down, don't let 'em push you around. Don't let 'em ever change your point of view. . Paradise was closed so they headed for the coast in a blissful manner.

Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side. Don't let them put you down, don't let 'em push you around. Don't let 'em ever change your point of view. . Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side. . Billy wrote a letter back home to Patti's parents tryin' to explain. He said we're both real sorry that it had to turn out this way.

Just the two of us building castles in the sky. Just the two of us, you and I. We look for love, no time for tears. Wasted water's all that is and it don't make no flowers grow.

Just the two of us, we can make it, just the two of usWe walked in the cold air. Freezing breath on a window pane. Lying and waiting. A man in the dark in a picture frame. So mystic and soulful. A voice reaching out in a piercing cry. It stays with you until. The feeling has gone, only you and I. It means nothing to me. This means nothing to me. Oh, Vienna. The music is weaving. Haunting notes, pizzicato strings. The rhythm is calling. Alone in the night as the daylight brings. A cool, empty silence. The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky. It fades to the distance. The image has gone, only you and I. It means nothing to me. This means nothing to me. Oh, Vienna. This means nothing to me. This means nothing to me. Oh, ViennaYou gotta speed it up. And then you gotta slow it down. 'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top. You gotta play around. But soon you will find that there comes a time. For making your mind up. You gotta turn it on. And then you gotta put it out. You gotta be sure that it's something. Everybody's gonna talk about. Before you decide that the time's arrived. For making your mind up. Don't let your indecision. Take you from behind. Trust your inner vision. Don't let others change your mind. And now you really gotta burn it up. And make another fly by night. Get a run for your money. And take a chance and it'll turn out right. But when you can see how it's gotta be. You're making your mind up. And try to look as if you don't care less. But if you wanna see some more. Bending the rules of the game. Will let you find the one you're looking for. And then you can show that you think you know. You're making your mind up. Don't let your indecision. Take you from behind. Trust your inner vision. Don't let others change your mind. And now you really gotta speed it up. And then you gotta slow it down. 'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top. You gotta play around. But soon you will find that there comes a time. For making your mind up. And now you really gotta speed it up. And then you gotta slow it down. 'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top. You gotta play around. But soon you will find that there comes a time. For making your mind up. For making your mind up. For making your mind up. For making your mind upThere'll be no strings to bind your hands. not if my love can't bind your heart.. There's no need to take a stand. for it was I who chose to start.. I see no need to take me home. I'm old enough to face the dawn.. Just call me angel of the morning, Angel. Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.. Just call me angel of the morning, Angel. Then slowly turn away from me.. Maybe the sun's light will be dim. and it won't matter anyhow..

When people lock their doors and hide inside. Rumor has it it's the end of Paradise. But I know, if the world just passed us by. Baby I know, I wouldn't have to cry no, no. The best of times are when I'm alone with you. Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two. Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime. We'll take the best, forget the rest. And someday we'll find these are the best of times. These are the best of times. The headlines read 'these are the worst of times'. I do believe it's true. I feel so helpless like a boat against the tide. I wish the summer wind could bring back Paradise. But I know, if the world turned upside down. Baby, I know you'd always be around.

Hoping it'll take me. Just a little farther down the line. Moonlight. You're just a heartache in disguise. Won't you keep my heart from breaking. If it's only for a very short time. Playing with the queen of hearts. Knowing it ain't really smart. The joker ain't the only fool. Who'll do anything for you. Laying out another lie. Thinking 'bout a life of crime. That's what I'll have to do. To keep me away from you. Honey, you know it makes you mad. Why is everybody telling everybody. What you have done. Baby, I know it makes you sad. But when they're handing out the heartaches. You know you got to have you some. Playing with the queen of hearts. Knowing it ain't really smart. The joker ain't the only fool. Who'll do anything for you. Laying out another lie. Thinking 'bout a life of crime. That's what I'll have to do. To keep me away from you. Lovers, I know you've had a few. But hide your heart beneath the covers. And tell 'em they're the only one. And others, they know just. What I'm going through. And it's a-hard to be a lover. When you say you're only in it for fun. Playing with the queen of hearts. Knowing it ain't really smart. The joker ain't the only fool. Who'll do anything for you. Playing with the queen of hearts. Knowing it ain't really smart. The joker ain't the only fool. Who'll do anything for you. Laying out another lie. Thinking 'bout a life of crime. That's what I'll have to do. To keep me away from you. Playing with the queen of hearts.

When I say, "I love you" you say,"You better". (You better, you better, you bet). When I say, "I need you you" say,"You better". (You better, you better, you bet). You better bet your life. Or love will cut you like a knife. I lay on the bed with you. We could make some book of records. Your dog keeps licking my nose. And chewing up all those letters saying,"You better". You better bet your life. You better love me all the time now. You better shove me back into line now. You better love me all the time now. You better shove me back into line now. I showed up late one night. With a neon light for a visa. But knowing I'm so eager to fight. Can't make letting me in any easier. I know I've been wearing crazy clothes. And I look pretty crappy sometimes. But my body feels so good. And I still sing a razor line every time. And when it comes to all night living. I know what I'm giving. I've got it all down to a tee and it's free. When I say,"I love you" you say,"You better". (You better, you better, you bet). When I say,"I need you" you say,"You better". (You better, you better, you bet). When I say,"I love you" you say, "You better". (You better, you better, you bet). When I say,"I need you" you scream,"You better". (You better, you better, you bet). When I say,"I love you" you say,"You better". (You better, you better, you bet). When I say,"I need you" you say,"You better". (You better, you better, you bet). When I say,"I love you"you say,"You better". (You better, you better, you bet). When I say,"I need you" you scream,"You better". (You better, you better, you bet). You better bet your life. Or love will cut you just like a knifeIt's all because of you I'm feeling sad and blue. You went away now my life is just a rainy day. I love you so, how much you'll never know. You've gone away and left me lonely. Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me of love so true. That once turned all my gray skies blue. But you've disappeared, now my eyes are filled with tears. I'm wishin' you were here with me. Soft with love are my thoughts of you. Now that you're gone I don't know what to do. If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears. The sun would shine and once again you'd be mine, all mine. But in reality, you and I will never be. â€~Cause you took your love away from me, hooh. If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears. The sun would shine, once again you'd be mine, all mine. But in reality, you and I will never be. â€~Cause you took your love away from me, hooh, baby. You took your love away from me.

I 've no doubt. you dream about the things you never do. but I wish someone had a talk to me like I wanna talk to you. Ooh, I've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could run. Took the hand of a preacher man. and we made love in the sun. But I ran out of places and friendly faces. Because I had to be free. I've been to paradise but I've never been to me.... Please lady please lady. don't just walk away. 'cause I have this need to tell you. why I'm all alone today. I can see so much of me. still living in your eyes. won't you share a part. of a weary heart that has lived a million lives. Ooh, I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece. when I sipped champagne on a yacht. I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo. and showed them what I've got. I've been undressed by kings. and I've seen some things that a woman ain't s'posed to see. I've been to paradise but I've never been to me.... Hey, you know what paradise is?. It's a lie. a fantasy we created about people and places. as we like them to be. but you know what truth is?. it's that little baby you're holding. and it's that man you fought with this morning. the same one you are gonna make love to tonight. that's truth that's love. Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children. that might have made me complete. but I, I took the sweet life. I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet. I spent my life exploring. the subtle whoring. that costs too much to be free. Hey lady I've been to paradise. but I've never been to me.... I've been to paradise - never been to me. (I've been to Georgia and California, and anywhere I could run). I've been to paradise - never been to me. (I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece. While I sipped champagne on a yacht). I've been to paradise - never been to me. (Fade)Oh, it's raining again. Oh no, my love's at an end. Oh no, it's raining again. And you know it's hard to pretend. Oh no, it's raining again.

I'm gonna turn and leave you here. All of my life I've been waitin' in the rain. I've been waitin' for a feeling that never, ever came. It feels so close but always disappears. Darlin', in your wildest dreams. You never had a clue. But it's time you got the news. I'm gonna harden my heart. I'm gonna swallow my tears. I'm gonna turn and leave you here.

Im tv-funk da laeuft es nicht, jah. Sie war so jung, das Herz so rein und weiss. Und jede Nacht hat ihren Preis. Sie sagt: "Sugar sweet, jah'got me rapp'in to the heat!". Sie sagt: Babe you know, I miss my Funky friends". Sie meint, Jack und Jill. Mein funk Verstaendnis reicht zur Not. Ich ueberreiss' was sie jetzt will. Ich ueberlege bei mir, ihre Nase spricht dafuer. Waehrend dessen ich noch rauche. Die "special places" sind ihr wohlbekannt. Ich meine, sie faehrt ja U-bahn auch dort singen's:. Dreh dich nicht um - oh, oh, oh. Der Kommissar geht um - oh, oh, oh. Er wird dich anschauen, und du weisst warum. Die Lebenslust bringt dich um. Alles klar Herr Kommissar?. (Hey man, wanna buy some stuff man?. Did you ever rap that thing Jack, so rap it to the beat). Wir treffen Jill und Joe und dessen Bruder hip,. Und auch den Rest der koolen gang. Sie rappen hin, sie rappen her. Dazwischen kratzen's ab die Waend'. Dieser Fall ist klar lieber Herr Kommissar. Auch wenn sie anderer Meinung sind. Den Schnee auf dem wir alle talwaerts fahren. Kennt heute jedes Kind. Jetzt das Kinderlied. Dreh dich nicht um - oh, oh, oh. Der Kommissar geht um - oh, oh, oh. Er hat die Kraft und wir sind klein und dumm. Und dieser Frust macht uns stumm. La, la, la,la, la. Dreh dich nicht um - oh, oh, oh. Der Kommissar geht um - oh, oh, oh. Wenn er dich anspricht und du weisst warum. Sag' ihm dein Leben bringt dich um. La, la, la, la, la. Dreh dich nicht um - oh, oh, oh. Der Kommissar geht um - oh, oh, ohI've got to say it and it's hard for me. You got me crying like I thought I would never be. Love is believing, but you let me down. How can I love you when you ain't around?. And I look into the morning and you never call. Love should be everything or not at all. And it don't matter whatever you do. I've made a life out of loving you. Only to find any dream that I follow is dying. I'm crying in the rain. I could be searching my world for a love ever lasting. Feeling no pain, when will we meet again?. Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?. Is it a lesson that I never knew?. Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under. My love for you. Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?. When I was being what you want me to be. Suddenly everything I ever wanted. Has passed me by. This world may end. Not you and I. My love is stronger than the universe. My soul is crying for you and that cannot be reversed. You've made the rules and you could not see. You've made a life out of hurting me. Out of my mind, I am held by the power of you love. Tell me when do we try, or should we say goodbye?. Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?. When I was being what you want me to be. Suddenly everything I ever wanted. Has passed me by. Oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker?. Is it a lesson that I never knew?. Suddenly everything I ever wanted. My love for you. Oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker?. When I was being what you want me to be. Suddenly everything I ever wanted. Has passed me by. Help me. Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?Well he was Thailand based. She was an airforce wife. He used to fly weekends. It was the easy life. But then it turned around. And he began to change. She didn’t wonder then. She didn’t think it strange. But then he got a call. He had to leave that night. He couldn’t say too much. But it would be alright. He didn’t need to pack. They’d meet the next night. He had a job to do. Flying to Cambodia. . And as the nights passed by. She tried to trace the past. The way he used to look. The way he used to laugh. I guess she’ll never know. What got inside his soul. She couldn’t make it out. Just couldn’t take it all. He had the saddest eyes. The girl had ever seen. He used to cry some nights. As though he lived a dream. Ans as she held him close. He used to search her face. As though she knew the truth. Lost inside Cambodia. . But then a call came through. They said he’d soon be home. She had to pack a case. And they would make a rendez-vous. But now a year has passed. And not a single word. And all the love she knew. Has disappeared out in the haze. Cambodia - Don’t cry now - No tears now. . And now the years have passed. With not a single word. But there is only one thing left. I know for sure. She won’t see his face againI can see that it won't be long. You grow cold when you keep holding on. You know you've changed and your words they lie. That's something you can't deny. I know you're not at home. You're home but not alone. If you want to leave then why don't you say. Your love is gone anyway. I know it won't be long,. Won't be long before you're gone. There's something going on. There's something going on. I know a good thing must come to an end. But it's hard to take loosing a friend. I know what you think and what's in your mind. So darling don't quite pretend. I know it won't be long. It won't be long before you're gone. There's something going on. There's something going on. There's something going on. There's something going on. I know it won't be long. It won't be long before you're gone. There's something going on. There's something going on. There's something going on.

I'm on the hunt I'm after you. Smell like I a sound, I'm lost in a crowd. And I'm hungry like the wolf. Straddle the line in discord and rhyme. I'm on the hunt, I'm after you. Mouth is alive with juices like wine. And I'm hungry like the wolf. Stalked in the forest too close to hide. I'll be upon you by the moonlight side. (Do do do do do do do). (Do do do do do do do do).

Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found. And I'm hungry like the wolf. Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme. I howl and I whine I'm after you. Mouth is alive all runnin' inside. And I'm hungry like the wolf. Hungry like the wolf. Hungry like the wolf. Hungry like the wolf. Burnin' the ground I break from the crowd. I'm on the hunt, I'm after you. I smell like I sound, I'm lost and I'm found. And I'm hungry like the wolf. Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme. I'm on the hunt, I'm after you. Mouth is alive with juices like wine.

And gravity won't pull you through. You know you're missing out on something. Well that something depends on you. . All I'm saying. It takes a lot to love you. All I'm doing. You know it's true. . All I need now. There's one thing. Yes, one thing that turns this gray sky to blue. . That's the look, that's the look. The look of love.

Where's the look?. If I knew I would tell you. . What's the look?. Look for your information. Yes, there's one thing, one thing that still hold true. What's that?. .

They say, "Martin, maybe one day you'll find true love". I say, "Maybe there must be a solution. To the one thing, the one thing we can't find". . That's the look, that's the look. Sisters and brothers. That's the look, that's the look. Should help each other. That's the look, that's the look. Ooh, ooh Heavens above. . That's the look, that's the look. Hip hip hooray.

I turned around when I heard. The sound of footsteps on the floor. Said he was a killer. Now I know it's true. I'm dead when you walk out the door. Hey, babe, I'm hooked on you. Can't stop now, don't you know?. I ain't never gonna let you go. Don't go. Can't stop now, don't you know?. I ain't never gonna let you go. Don't go. Can't stop now, don't you know?.

I ain't never gonna let you go. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Don't goNow the King told the boogie men, "You have to let that raga drop. The oil down the desert way, has been shakin' to the top". The Sheikh he drove his Cadillac, he went a cruisin' down the Ville. The Muezzin was a' standing on the radiator grille. . The Shareef don't like it. Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah. The Shareef don't like it. Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah. . By order of the Prophet, we ban that boogie sound. Degenerate the faithful with that crazy casbah sound. The Bedouin they brought out, the electric camel drum. The local guitar picker got his guitar picking thumb. As soon as the Shareef had cleared the square they began to wail. . The Shareef don't like it. Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah. The Shareef don't like it. Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah. . Now over at the temple, oh, they really pack 'em in. The in crowd say it's cool to dig this chanting thing. But as the wind changed direction then the temple band took five. The crowd caught a wiff of that crazy casbah jive. . The Shareef don't like it. Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah. The Shareef don't like it. Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah. . The King called up his jet fighters, he said, "You better earn your pay". Drop your bombs between the minarets down the Casbah way. As soon as the Shareef was chauffeured outta there. The jet pilots tuned to the cockpit radio blare. As soon as the Shareef was outta their hair the jet pilots wailed. . The Shareef don't like it. Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah. The Shareef don't like it. Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah. . The Shareef don't like it. He thinks it's not kosher. Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah. The Shareef don't like it. Fundamentally he can't take it. Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah. The Shareef don't like it. You know he really hates itIt's like a jungle sometimes. It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under. Broken glass everywhere. People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care. I can't take the smell, can't take the noise. Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice. Rats in the front room, roaches in the back. Junkies in the alley with the baseball bat. I tried to get away but I couldn't get far. Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car. Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge. I'm trying not to lose my head. It's like a jungle sometimes. It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under. Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window. Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow. Crazy lady, livin' in a bag. Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag. Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango. A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses. Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps. So she can tell her stories to the girls back home. She went to the city and got social security. She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own. It's like a jungle sometimes. It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under. My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV. Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy. All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night. Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight. The bill collectors, they ring my phone. And scare my wife when I'm not home. Got a bum education, double-digit inflation. Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station. Neon King Kong standin' on my back. Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac. A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane. Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane. I swear I might hijack a plane!. It's like a jungle sometimes. It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under. My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school. Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool. And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper. If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper. Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet. Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps. Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny. You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey. They pushed that girl in front of the train. Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again. Stabbed that man right in his heart. Gave him a transplant for a brand new start. I can't walk through the park cause it's crazy after dark. Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run. I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw. Hear them say "You want some more?". Livin' on a see-saw. It's like a jungle sometimes. It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under. A child is born with no state of mind. Blind to the ways of mankind. God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too. Because only God knows what you'll go through. You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate. And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate. The places you play and where you stay. Looks like one great big alleyway. You'll admire all the number-book takers. Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers. Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens. And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh. Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers. Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers. You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool. But then you wind up droppin' outta high school. Now you're unemployed, all non-void. Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd. Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did. Got sent up for a eight-year bid. Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag. Spend the next two years as a undercover fag. Bein' used and abused to serve like hell. Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell. It was plain to see that your life was lost. You was cold and your body swung back and forth. But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song. Of how you lived so fast and died so young so. It's like a jungle sometimes. It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' underTwo, ah-three, ah-four. Two, ah-three, ah-four. Two, ah-three, ah-four. I really should be saying goodnight. I really shouldn't stay anymore. It's been so long since I held ya. I've forgotten what love is for. I should run. On the double. I think I'm in trouble. I think I'm in trouble. I think I'm in trouble. So come to me darlin' and hold me. Let your honey keep you warm. Been so long since I held ya. I've forgotten what love is for. I should run. On the double. I think I'm in trouble. I think I'm in trouble. I think I'm in trouble. I think I'm in trouble. I should run. On the double. I think I'm in trouble. I think I'm in trouble. I think I'm in trouble. I think I'm in troubleDon't think sorry's easily said. Don't try, turnin' tables instead. You've taken lots of chances before. But I ain't gonna give anymore. Don't ask me. That's how it goes. 'Cause part of me knows what you're thinkin'. Don't say words you're gonna regret. Don't let the fire rush to your head. I've heard the accusation before. And I ain't gonna take any more. Believe me. The sun in your eyes. Made some of the lies worth believing. I am the eye in the sky, looking at you. I can read your mind. I am the maker of rules, dealing with fools. I can cheat you blind. And I don't need to see any more. To know that. I can read your mind. (Looking at you). I can read your mind. (Looking at you).

This is my investigation, it's not a public inquiry. I go checking out the reports, digging up the dirt. You get to meet all sorts in this line of work. Treachery and treason, there's always an excuse for it. And when I find the reason, I still can't get used to it. And what have you got at the end of the day?. What have you got to take away?. A bottle of whiskey and a new set of lies. Blinds on the windows and a pain behind the eyes. Scarred for life, no compensation. Private investigationsLying beside you here in the dark. Feeling your heart beat with mine. Softly you whisper, you're so sincere. How could our love be so blind?. We sailed on together. We drifted apart. And here you are by my side. So now I come to you with open arms. Nothing to hide, believe what I say. So here I am with open arms. Hoping you'll see what your love means to me, open arms. Living without you, living alone. This empty house seems so cold. Wanting to hold you, wanting you near. How much I wanted you home. But now that you've come back. Turned night into day. I need you to stay. So now I come to you with open arms. Nothing to hide, believe what I say. So here I am with open arms. Hoping you'll see what your love means to me, open armsBlue eyes. Baby's got blue eyes. Like a deep blue sea. On a blue blue day. Blue eyes. Baby's got blue eyes. When the morning comes. I'll be far away and I say. Blue eyes holding back the tears. Holding back the pain. Baby's got blue eyes. And she's alone again. Blue eyes. Baby's got blue eyes. Like a clear blue sky. Watching over me. Blue eyes. I love blue eyes. When I'm by her side. Where I long to be, I will see. Blue eyes laughing in the sun. Laughing in the rain. Baby's got blue eyes. And I am home and I am home again. Blue eyes laughing in the sun. Laughing in the rain. Baby's got blue eyes. And I am home againNow, the mist across the window hides the lines. But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine. Electricity so fine. Look and dry your eyes. We, so tired of all the darkness in our lives. With no more angry words to say can come alive. Get into a car and drive to the other side. (Me babe, steppin' out). Into the night, into the light. You babe, steppin' out. Into the night, into the light. We are young but getting old before our time. We'll leave the TV and the radio behind. Don't you wonder what we'll find. Steppin' out tonight. You can dress in pink and blue just like a child. And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile. We'll be there in just a while, if you follow me. (Me babe, steppin' out). Into the night, into the light. You babe, steppin' out. Into the night, into the light. Me babe, steppin' out. Into the night, into the light. You babe, steppin' out. Into the night, into the light. Me babe, steppin' out. Into the night, into the lightYou've got the love, you've got the power. But you just don't understand. Girl you've been charging by the hour. For your love. I'm tryin' to show how much I love you. Still believin', in romance. You're taking way too many chances. With my love. I remember. When you used to be. The talk of the town. All you get is lonely. Turn your love around. Don't you turn me down. I can show you how. Turn your love around. Without the woman I can make it. But I need the girl to stay. Oh don't you let the lady take it. All away. When the one I need's a. Taste of yesterday. But you stay at home. All they get is lonely. Turn your love around. Don't you turn me down. I can show you how. Turn your love around. Oh girl you know me, I'm alone until you show me. That you're still in love with me. We're gonna make it, we're gonna take it. Back where we belong. Turn your love around. Don't you turn me down. I can show you how. Turn your love around. Turn your love around. This time the girl became a woman. Don't you turn me down. Every woman needs a man. I can show you how. I love the girl. I love the woman. Turn your love around. Turn your love around. This time the girl became a woman. Don't you turn me down. Every woman needs a man. I can show you how. I love the girl. I love the woman. Turn your love around. Turn your love around. This time the girl became a woman. Don't you turn me down. Every woman needs a man. I can show you howYou ask me where to begin. Am I so lost in my sin. You ask me where did I fall. I'll say I can't tell you when. But if my spirit is lost. How will I find what is near. Don't question I'm not alone. Somehow I'll find my way home. My sun shall rise in the east. So shall my heart be at peace. And if you're asking me when. I'll say it starts at the end. You know your will to be free. Is matched with love secretly. And talk will alter your prayer. Somehow you'll find you are there. Your friend is close by your side. And speaks in far ancient tongue. A season's wish will come true. All seasons begin with you. One world we all come from. One world we melt into one. Just hold my hand and we're there. Somehow we're going somewhere. Somehow we're going somewhere. You ask me where to begin. Am I so lost in my sin. You ask me where did I fall. I'll say I can't tell you when. But if my spirit is strong. I know it can't be long. No questions I'm not alone. Somehow I'll find my way home. Somehow I'll find my way home. Somehow I'll find my way home. Somehow I'll find my way homeI found a picture of you, ohh ohh. You'd hijacked my world at night. To a place in the past we've been passed out of, ohh ohh. Now we're back in the fight.   (Ooh, ah). We're back on the train, yeah.   (Ooh, ah).   (Ooh, ah). Oh, back on the chain gang. Circumstance beyond our control, ohh ohh. The phone, TV and the news of the world. Got in the house like a pigeon from Hell, ohh ohh. Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies.   (Ooh, ah). We're just back on the train, yeah.   (Ooh, ah).   (Ooh, ah). Ah, back on the chain gang. The powers that be that force us to live like we do. Bring me to my knees when I see what they've done to you. Well, I'll die as I stand here today knowing that deep in my heart. They'll fall to ruin one day for makin' us part. I found a picture of you, ohh ohh. Those were the happiest days of my life. Like a break in the battle was your part, ohh ohh. In the wretched life of a lonely heart.   (Ooh, ah). Now we're back on the train, yeah.   (Ooh, ah).   (Ooh, ah). Ah, back on the chain gangQueen. Greatest Hits. Body Language.

Cos it's the one we'll never know. And quit running for that runaway bus. Cos those rosey days are few. And - stop apologising for the things you've never done,. Cos time is short and life is cruel. But it's up to us to change. This town called malice.. Rows and rows of disused milk floats. Stand dying in the dairy yard. And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk. Bottles to their hearts. Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry. It's enough to make you stop believing when tears come. Fast and furious. In a town called malice.. Struggle after struggle, year after year. The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice. I'm almost stone cold dead. In a town called malice.. A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef. Gets dashed against the Co-op. To either cut down on beer or the kids new gear. It's a big decision in a town called malice.. The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track. It's at the moment bound for nowhere. Just going round and round. Playground kids and creaking swings. Lost laughter in the breeze. I could go on for hours and I probably will. But I'd sooner put some joy back. In this town called malice. In this town called malice. In this town called malice...Can't you understand me?. Baby, don't you hand me a line. Although it doesn't matter. You and me got plenty of time. There's nobody in the future. So baby let me hand you my love. Oh no step for you to dance to. So slip your hand inside of my glove. Hold me, hold me, hold me. Hold me, hold me, hold me. I don't want no damage. But how'm I gonna manage with you?. Oh you want the percentage. But I'm the fool payin' the dues. I'm just around the corner. If you got a minute to spare. And I'll be waitin' for you. If you ever wanna be there. Hold me, hold me, hold me. Hold me, hold me, hold me. Hold me, hold me, hold me. Hold me, hold me, hold me. Hold me, hold me, hold me. Hold me, hold me, hold me. Hold me, hold me, hold me. ...I must have left my house at eight because I always do. My train, I'm certain left the station just when it was due. I must have read the morning paper going into town. And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned. I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine. With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed. I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so. The usual place, the usual bunch. And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained. The day before you came. I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two. And at the time I never even noticed I was blue. I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day. Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away. At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule. A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school. The train back home again. Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then. Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame. The day before you came. I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so. And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go. I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV. There's not, I think a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see. I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten. I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then. I must have read a while. The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style. It's funny but I had no sense of living without aim. The day before you came. And turning out the light I must have yawned. And curled up for yet another night. And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain. The day before you cameWhat happened here. As the New York sunset disappeared. I found an empty garden. Among the flagstones there. Who lived here he must have been a gardener. That cared a lot who weeded out the tears. And grew a good crop and now it all looks strange. It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain. And what's it for this little empty garden. By the brownstone door and in the cracks. Along the sidewalk nothing grows no more. Who lived here he must have been a gardener. That cared a lot who weeded out the tears. And grew a good crop and we are so amazed. We're crippled and we're dazed. A gardener like that one no one can replace. And I've been knocking but no one answers. And I've been knocking most all the day. Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny. Can't you come out to play. And through their tears. Some say he farmed his best in younger years. But he'd have said that roots grow stronger. If only he could hear. Who lived here he must have been a gardener. That cared a lot who weeded out the tears. And grew a good crop now we pray for rain. And with every drop that falls. We hear, we hear your name. And I've been knocking but no one answers. And I've been knocking most all the day. Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny. Can't you come out to play. And I've been knocking but no one answers. And I've been knocking most all the day. Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny. Can't you come out, can't you come out to play. Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden. Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden. Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden. Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden. Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden. Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty gardenStars in your eyes, little one. Where do you go to dream. To a place, we all know. The land of make believe. Shadows, tapping at your window. Ghostly voices whisper will you come and play. Not for all the tea in China. Or the corn in Carolina. Never, never ever. They're running after you babe. Run for the sun, little one. You're an outlaw once again. Time to change, Superman. He'll be with us while he can. In the land of make believe. Something nasty in your garden's waiting. Patiently, till it can have your heart. Try to go but it won't let you. Don't you know it's out to get you running. Keep on running. They're running after you babe. Run for the sun, little one. You're an outlaw once again. Time to change, Superman. He'll be with us while he can. In the land of make believe. Your world is turning. From night to day. Your dream is burning far, far away. Into the blue. You and I. To the circus in the sky. Captain Kids. On the sand. With the treasure close at hand. In the land of make believe. In the land of make believe. Run for the sun, little one. You're an outlaw once again. Time to change, Superman. He'll be with us while he can. In the land of make believe. Run for the sun, little one. You're an outlaw once again. Time to change, Superman. He'll be with us while he can. In the land of make believe. I've got a friend who comes to tea. And no-one else can see but me. He came today. But had to go. To visit you. You never knowYou ask me if I'm happy here. No doubt about it. You ask me if my love is clear. Want me to shout it. Gave you the best years of my life. Woman. I know I failed to treat you right. Woman. Don't let me out of here. Don't let me out of here. Won't let you down again. Won't let you down again. You say our love is running one way. Coming from your side. No help from me to see it through. To beat the high tide. Take me and chain me if you please. Woman. Don't help me dig deeper my grave. Woman. Don't let me out of here. Don't let me out of here. Won't let you down again. Won't let you down again. Won't let you down again. Won't let you down again. Won't let you down again. Won't let you down again. Won't let you down again. Won't let you down againDolly Parton. Greatest Hits. I Will Always Love You. If i should stay. Well, i would only be in your way.

Fallen leaves in the night. Who can say where they're blowing?. As free as the wind. Hopefully learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning?. More than this, you know there is nothing. More than this, tell me one thing. More than this, there is nothing. It was fun for a while. There was no way of knowing. Like a dream in the night. Who can say where we're going?. No care in the world. Maybe I'm learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning?. More than this, you know there is nothing. More than this, tell me one thing. More than this, now there is nothing. More than this, nothing. More than this. More than this, nothingMoving on the floor now babe you're a bird of Paradise. Cherry ice-cream smile I suppose it's very nice. With a step to your left and a flick to the right. You catch that mirror way out west. You know you're something special and you look like you're the best. Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand. Just like that river twisting through a dusty land. And when she shines she really shows you all she can. Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande. I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TV. Two of a billion stars, it means so much to me. Like a birthday or a pretty view. But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you. Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand. Just like that river twisting through a dusty land. And when she shines she really shows you all she can. Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Hey now woo, look at that did he nearly run you down. At the end of the drive, the lawmen arrive you make me feel. Alive, alive, alive. I'll take my chance, 'cause luck is on my side. I'll tell you something, I know what you're thinking. I'll tell you something, I know what you're thinking. Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand. Just like that river twist across a dusty land. And when she shines she really shows you all she can. Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande. Her name is Rio, she don't need to understand. And I might find her if I'm looking like I can. Oh Rio, Rio hear them shout across the land.

You know the kind you read about. And have to laugh. At the pages in between. Now I can’t believe that fool inside is me. ‘Cos I just can’t face the world. I’ve grown to see. . View from a bridge, can’t take anymore. View from a bridge, can’t take anymore. . I saw you kissing her. I saw you making her. In the soft sheets in between. But when you turned around. I saw your eyes were fire. And you crashed out all my dreams. . And like a fool I just stood there. And let it go. I should have fought right back. And let my feelings show. . View from a bridge, can’t take anymore. View from a bridge, can’t take anymore. . You sure as hell knew how. To make a fool out of me. Well you cut me down. For the things you want. And now it’s killing me. . I’ll lay it on the line now. You’re running out of time now. . But then a voice said jump. And I just let go. And I’m floating out in space. But then I feel your arms. And I turn around. To a ghost without a face. . And I just don’t know. What’s fact or fantasy. ‘Cos when I look below the bridge. I see it’s meIt started with a kiss in the back row of a classroom.. How could I resist the aroma of your perfume.. You and I were inseparable. it was love at first sight.. You made me promise to marry you. I made you promise to be my wife. But then you were only eight years old and I had just about turned nine.. I thought that life was always good. I thought you always would be mine.. It started with a kiss. never thought it would come to this.. It started with a kiss. never thought it would come to this.. I remember ev'ry little thing like fighting in the playground. As some good looking boy had started to hang around.. That boy hurt me so bad. but I was happy 'cause you cried. - still -. I couldn't help but notice that new distant look in your eyes. And then when you were sixteen. and I had just turned seventeen. I couldn't hold on to your love. I couldn't hold on to my dreams.. It started with a kiss. never thought is would come to this.. It started with a kiss. never thought it would come to this.. You don't remember me. do you? You don't remember me. do you?. Walking down the street came the star of my love story. And my heart began to beat so fast. so clear was my memory.. I heard my voice cry out her name. and as she looked and looked away. I felt so hurt. I felt so small. and it was all that I could say. You don't remember me. do you? You don't remember me. do you?. You don't remember me. do you? You don't remember me. do you?. It started with a kiss. never thought it would come to this.. It started with a kiss. never thought it would come to this.Party people, party people. Can y'all get funky?.

Every now and then I fall apart. Turn around, bright eyes. Every now and then I fall apart. And I need you now tonight. And I need you more than ever. And if you only hold me tight. We'll be holding on forever. And we'll only be making it right. 'Cause we'll never be wrong. Together we can take it to the end of the line. Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time. I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark. We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks. I really need you tonight. Forever's gonna to start tonight. Forever's gonna to start tonight. Once upon a time I was falling in love. Now I'm only falling apart. There's nothing I can do. A total eclipse of the heart. Once upon a time there was light in my life. But now there's only love in the dark. Nothing I can say. A total eclipse of the heart. Turn around, bright eyes. Every now and then I fall apart. Turn around, bright eyes. Every now and then I fall apart. And I need you now tonight. And I need you more than ever. And if you only hold me tight. We'll be holding on forever. And we'll only be making it right. 'Cause we'll never be wrong. Together we can take it to the end of the line. Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time. I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark. We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks. I really need you tonight. Forever's gonna to start tonight. Forever's gonna to start tonight. Once upon a time I was falling in love.

All alone, I sit home by the phone. Waiting for you, baby. Through the years. How can you stand to hear. My pleading for you dear?. You know I'm crying ooh ooh ooh ooh. Go, go, go where you want. But don't leave me here forever. You, you, you stay away. So long girl, I see you never. What can I do. Girl to get through to you?. Cause I love you, baby. Standing here, baptisted in all my tears. Baby through the years. You know I'm crying ooh ooh ooh ooh. You never ever worry. And you never shed a tear. You saying that my love ain't real. Just look at my face. These tears ain't drying. You, you, you can never say. That I'm not the one who really loves you. I pray, pray, pray every day. That you'll see things, girl like I do. What can I do girl, to get through to you?. Cause I love you baby. Standing here baptised in all my tears. Baby through the years. You know I'm crying, ooh ooh ooh ooh oohYou and I in a little toy shop. Buy a bag of balloons. With the money we've got. Set them free at the break of dawn. 'Til one by one, they were gone. Back at base, bugs in the software. Flash the message. "Something's out there". Floating in the summer sky. 99 red balloons go by. 99 red balloons. Floating in the summer sky. Panic bells, it's red alert. There's something here. From somewhere else. The war machine springs to life. Opens up one eager eye. Focusing it on the sky. Where 99 red balloons go by. 99 Decision Street. 99 ministers meet. To worry, worry, super-scurry. Call the troops out in a hurry. This is what we've waited for. This is it boys, this is war. The president is on the line. As 99 red balloons go by. 99 Knights of the airway. Ride super-high-tech jet fighters. Everyone's a Silverhero. Everyone's a Captain Kirk. With orders to identify. To clarify and classify. Scramble in the summer sky. As 99 red balloons go by. As 99 red balloons go by. 99 dreams I have had. In every one a red balloon. It's all over and I'm standin' pretty. In this dust that was a city. If I could find a souvenier. Just to prove the world was here. And here is a red balloon. I think of you and let it go.Sweet dreams are made of these.. Who am I to disagree?. Travel the world and the seven seas..

Please don't procrastinate. It's not good to masturbateJust a steel town girl on a Saturday night. Lookin' for the fight of her life. In the real-time world no one sees her at all. They all say she's crazy. Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart. Changing movement into light. She has danced into the danger zone. When the dancer becomes the dance. It can cut you like a knife, if the gift becomes the fire. On a wire between will and what will be. She's a maniac, maniac on the floor. And she's dancing like she's never danced before. She's a maniac, maniac on the floor. And she's dancing like she's never danced before. (crazy! crazy! crazy! crazy!). On the ice-blue line of insanity is a place most never see. It's a hard-won place of mystery: touch it, but can't hold it.. You work all your life for that moment in time, it could come or pass you by. It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance. If the hunger stays the night. There's a cold kinetic heat, struggling, stretching for the beat. Never stopping with her head against the wind. She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know. And she's dancing like she's never danced before. She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know. And she's dancing like she's never danced before. It can cut you like a knife, if the gift becomes the fire. On a wire between will and what will be. She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know (I sure know). And she's dancing like she's never danced before. She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know And she's dancing like she's never danced before. Maniac, maniac, I sure know And she's dancing like she's never danced beforeBoy. Boy. Now in the street there is violence. An' an' a lots of work to be done. No place to hang all our washing. An' an' I can't blame all on the sun. Oh no, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue. And then we'll take it higher. Oh we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue. And then we'll take it higher. Workin' so hard like a soldier. Can't afford a thing on TV. Deep in my heart I am warrior.

Always in time, but never in line for dreams. Head over heels when toe to toe. This is the sound of my soul. This is the sound. I bought a ticket to the world. But now I've come back again. Why do I find it hard to write the next line?. Oh, I want the truth to be said. I know this much is true. I know this much is true. With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue. Dissolve the nerves that have just begun. Listening to Marvin all night long. This is the sound of my soul. This is the sound. Always slipping from my hands. Sand's a time of it's own. Take your seaside arms and write the next line. Oh, I want the truth to be known. I know this much is true. I know this much is true. I bought a ticket to the world. But now I've come back again. Why do I find it hard to write the next line?. Oh, I want the truth to be said. I know this much is true. I know this much is true. This much is true. This much is true. This much is true. This much is true. This much is true. I know, I know, I know this much is true. This much is true. This much is true. This much is true. This much is true. I know, I know, I know this much is true.

This much is trueThe last that ever she saw him. Carried away by a moonlight shadow.. He passed on worried and warning. Carried away by a moonlight shadow.. Lost in a riddle that Saturday night. Far away on the other side.. He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight. And she couldn't find how to push through.. The trees that whisper in the evening. Carried away by a moonlight shadow.. Sing a song of sorrow and grieving. Carried away by a moonlight shadow.. All she saw was a silhouette of a gun. Far away on the other side.. He was shot six times by a man on the run. And she couldn't find how to push through.. I stay, I pray. See you in heaven far away.. I stay, I pray. See you in heaven one day.. Four a.m. in the morning. Carried away by a moonlight shadow.. I watched your vision forming. Carried away by a moonlight shadow.. Stars roll slowly in a silvery night. Far away on the other side.. Will you come to talk with me this night. But she couldn't find how to push through.. I stay, I pray. See you in heaven far away.. I stay, I pray. See you in heaven one day.. Caught in the middle of a hundred and five.. The night was heavy and the air was alive. But she couldn't find how to push through.. Carried away by a moonlight shadow. Carried away by a moonlight shadow.Tongue-tied or short of breath don't even try. Try a little harder. Something's wrong, I'm not naive, you must must be strong. Ooh, baby try. . Hey girl.

I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside there was something going on. . You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart. We got something going on. Tender love is blind it requires a dedication. All this love we feel needs no conversation. We ride it together, uh huh. Makin' love with each other, uh huh. Islands in the stream that is what we are. No one in between how can we be wrong?. Sail away with me to another world. And we rely on each other, uh huh. From one lover to another, uh huh. I can't live without you if the love is gone. Everything is nothing if you got no one. And you did walk in the night. Slowly losin' sight of the real thing. But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt. Too deep in love and we got no way out. And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing. No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never. We start and end as one in love forever. We can ride it together, uh huh. Makin' love with each other, uh huh. Islands in the stream that is what we are. No one in between how can we be wrong?. Sail away with me to another world. And we rely on each other, uh huh. From one lover to another, uh huh.

Ooh, ease my mind. And I need to find fine. Someone to call mine. My mama said "You can't hurry love. No, you'll just have to wait". She said "Love don't come easy. But It's a game of give and take". "You can't hurry love. No, you'll just have to wait. Just trust in the good time. No matter how long it takes". How many heartaches must I stand?. Before I find the love to let me live again. Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on. Is to feel my strength, you know it's almost gone. But remember mama said "You can't hurry love. No, you'll just have to wait". She said "Love don't come easy. It's a game of give and take". How long must I wait?. How much more must I take?. Before loneliness. 'Cause my heart, heart to break. And no, I cant bear to live my life alone. I grown impatient for a lover to call my own. Oh when I feel that I, I can't go on. You don't feel my state. You know I'm almost gonna remember mama said. "You can't hurry love. Oh, you'll just have to wait". She said "Love don't come easy. It's a game of give and take". "You can't hurry love. Oh, you'll just have to wait. Just trust in the good time. No matter how long it takes", and now break. When love, love don't come easy. I know I keep on waiting. Anticipating for that soft voice. To talk to me at night. For some tender arms. Hold me tight. I keep waiting. (Ooh, till that day). But it ain't easy. (Love don't come easy. No, you know it ain't easy. My mama said. "You can't hurry love. Oh, you'll just have to wait". She said "Love don't come easy. It's a game of give and take". "You can't hurry love. Oh, you'll just have to wait. Just trust in the good time. No matter how long it takes"I hear the drums echoing tonight. But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation. She's coming in, 12: 30 flight. The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation. I stopped an old man along the way. Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies. He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you". It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. I bless the rains down in Africa. Gonna take some time to do the things we never had. The wild dogs cry out in the night. As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company. I know that I must do what's right. As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti. I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become. It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. I bless the rains down in Africa. Gonna take some time to do the things we never had.

But the computer has the evidence. No need to abort. The countdown starts, watching in a trance. The crew is certain. Nothing left to chance, all is working. Trying to relax, up in the capsule. "Send me up a drink", jokes Major Tom. The count goes on. 4, 3, 2, 1. Earth below us, drifting falling. Floating weightless, calling calling home. Second stage is cut, we're now in orbit. Stabilizers up, running perfect. Starting to collect, requested data. What will it effect, when all is done. Thinks Major Tom. Back at ground control, there is a problem. Go to rockets full, not responding. Hello Major Tom, are you receiving. Turn the thrusters on, we're standing by. There's no reply. 4, 3, 2, 1. Earth below us, drifting, falling. Floating, weightless, calling, calling, home. Across the stratosphere. A final message, "Give my wife my love". Then nothing more. Far beneath the ship, the world is mourning. They don't realize, he's alive. No one understands but Major Tom sees. Now the life commands, this is my home. I'm coming home. Earth below us, drifting, falling. Floating, weightless, coming home. Earth below us, drifting, falling. Floating, weightless, coming home. Earth below us, drifting, falling. Floating, weightless, coming, coming home.

I love her, need her, she means so much to me. She's all right. She's got what it takes. She's got what it takes. And with me she really rates. Well, now she's my cutie, my tutti frutti. My heart, my love, my bathing beauty. She's all right. She's got what it takes. She's got what it takes. And with me she really rates. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Reet petite. The finest girl you ever wanna meet. Reet petite. The finest girl you ever wanna meet. Reet petite. The finest girl you ever wanna meet(Instrumental)You consider me the young apprentice. Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis. Hypnotized by you if I should linger. Staring at the ring around your finger. I have only come here seeking knowledge. Things they would not teach me of in college. I can see the destiny you sold. Turned into a shining band of gold. I'll be wrapped around your finger. I'll be wrapped around your finger. Mephistopheles is not your name. I know what you're up to, just the same. I will listen hard to your tuition. You will see it come to its fruition. And I'll be wrapped around your finger. I'll be wrapped around your finger. Devil and the deep blue sea behind me. Vanish in the air you'll never find me. I will turn your face to alabaster. When you find your servant is your master. You'll be wrapped around my finger. You'll be wrapped around your finger. You'll be wrapped around your fingerHear the screams of Center 42. Loud enough to bust your brains out. The opposition's tongue is cut in two. Keep off the street 'cause you're in danger. One hundred thousand disparus. Lost in the jails in South America. Cuddle up baby, cuddle up tight. Cuddle up baby, keep it all out of sight. Undercover, keep it all out of sight. Undercover of the night. The sex police are out there on the streets. Make sure the pass laws are not broken. The race militia has got itchy fingers. All the way from New York back to Africa. Cuddle up baby, keep it all out of sight. Cuddle up baby, keep it all out of sight. Cuddle up baby, keep it all out of sight. Undercover, undercover, undercover. Keep it all out of sight. Undercover of the night. All the young men, they've been rounded up. And sent to camps back in the jungle. And people whisper people double-talk. And once proud fathers act so humble. All the young girls they have got the blues. They're heading on back to Center 42. Undercover, all out of sight. Undercover, all out of sight. Undercover, all out of sight, undercover. Keep it all out of sight, undercover of the night. Down in the bars the girls are painted blue. Done up in lace, done up in rubber. The John's are jerky little G.I. Joe's. On R&R; from Cuba and Russia. The smell of sex, the smell of suicide. All these dream things I can't keep inside. Undercover all out of sight. Undercover of the night. Undercover of the night. Undercover of the night. Undercover, undercover. Undercover of the nightDon't put your head on my shoulder. Sink me in a river of tears. This could be the best place yet. But you must overcome your fears. In time it could have been so much more. The time is precious I know. In time it could have been so much more. The time has nothin' to show because. Time won't give me time. And time makes lovers feel like they've got somethin' real. But you and me, we know they've got nothin' but time. And time won't give me time won't give me time. Don't make me feel any colder. Time is like a clock in my heart. Touch, we touch, was the heat too much. I felt I lost you from the start. In time it could have been so much more. The time is precious I know. In time it could have been so much more. The time has nothin' to show because. Time won't give me time. And time makes lovers feel like they've got somethin' real. But you and me, we know they've got nothin' but time. And time won't give me time won't give me time. Time, time, time. In time it could have been so much more. The time is precious I know. In time it could have been so much more. The time has nothin' to show because. Time won't give me time. And time makes lovers feel like they've got somethin' real. But you and me, we know they've got nothin' but time. And you know time won't give me time. And time makes lovers feel like they've got somethin' real. But you and me, we know they've got nothin' but time. And you know time won't give me time. And time makes lovers feelThinkin' back in time. When love was only in my mind. I realize ain't no second chance. You've got to hold on to romance. Don't let it slide. There's a special kind of magic in the air. When you find another heart that needs to share. Baby, come to me. Let me put my arms around you. This was meant to be. And I'm, oh so glad, I found you. Need you ev'ry day. Gotta have your love around me. Baby, always stay. 'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you. Spendin' ev'ry dime. To keep you talkin' on the line. That's how it was. And all those walks together. Out in any kind of weather. Just because. There's a brand-new way. Of looking at your life. When you know that love. Is standing by your side. Baby, come to me. Let me put my arms around you. This was meant to be. And I'm oh so glad I found you. Need you ev'ry day. Gotta have your love around me. Baby, always stay. 'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you. The nights can be cold. There's a chill to ev'ry evenin'. When you're all alone. Don't talk anymore. 'Cause you know that I'll be here. To keep you warm. (Oh, darling keep me warm). Baby, come to me. (Come to me). Let me put my arms around you. This was meant to be. (My love). And I'm oh so, glad I found you. (Oh, so glad I found you).

This was meant to be. And I'm, oh so glad, I found you"Yes, but as a known scientist it would be surprising if the girl blinded ME with science... I know... I know...". Mmmmmm it's poetry in motion. When she turned her eyes to me. As deep as any ocean. Sweet as any harmony. She blinded me with science. And failed me in geometry. When she's dancing next to me. "Blinding me with science - science,". "Science,". I can hear machinery. "Blinding me with science - science!". "Science! Science!". Ha - it's poetry in motion. Now she's making love to me. The spheres are in commotion. The elements in harmony. She blinded me with science. "She blinded me with science,". And hit me with technology. When I'm dancing close to her. "Science,". I can smell the chemicals. "Blinding me with science - science!". "Science!". Ha! It's poetry in motion. Now she's making love to me. The spheres are in commotion. The elements in harmony. She blinded me with science. "She blinded me with science!". And hit me with technology. "Good heavens, Miss Sakamoto - you're beautiful!". I -. I don't believe it!. There she goes again!. She's tidied up, and I can't find anything!. All my tubes and wires. And careful notes. And antiquated notions [(what?!)]. But! - it's poetry in motion. When she turned her eyes to me. As deep as any ocean. Sweet as any harmony. She blinded me with science. "She blinded me with - with science!". She blinded me with -We're walking like in the dolce vita. This time we got it right. We're living like in the dolce vita. Gonna dream tonight. We're dancing like in the dolce vita. With lights and music on. Our love is made in the dolce vita. Nobody else than you. It's our last night. Together with our love again. Another light. Before we'll drown in darkness. Say you'll never leave me now. Say you're gonna love me now. We made it down in the dolce vita. Wipe all your fears away. We lived it like in the dolce vita. A game of yesterday. I'm so alone in the dolce vita. Oh baby telephone. This magic's gone in the dolce vita. Nobody else than you. It's our last night. Together with our love again. Another light. Before we'll drown in darkness. Say you'll never leave me now. Say you're gonna love me. (repeat)Tonight I celebrate my love for you. It seems the natural thing to do. Tonight no one's gonna find us. We'll leave the world behind us. When I make love to you. Tonight I celebrate my love for you. And hope that deep inside you'll feel it too. Tonight our spirits will be climbing. To a sky filled up with diamonds. When I make love to you, tonight. Tonight I celebrate my love for you. And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through. Tonight there'll be no distance between us. What I want most to do, is to get close to you, tonight. Tonight I celebrate my love for you. And soon this old world will seem brand new. Tonight we will both discover how friends turn into lovers. When I make love to you. Tonight I celebrate my love for you. And the midnight sun is gonna come shining through. Tonight there'll be no distance between us. What I want most to do, is to get close to you. Tonight I celebrate my love for you. TonightRemember that piano. So delightful unusual. That classic sensation. Sentimental confusion. Used to say. I like Chopin. Love me now and again wooh. Rainy days never say goodbye. To desire when we are together. Rainy days growing in your eyes. Tell me where's my way. Imagine your face. In a sunshine reflection. A vision of blue skies. Forever distractions. Used to say.

To desire when we are together. Rainy days growing in your eyes. Tell me where's my way. Rainy days never say goodbye. To desire when we are together. Rainy days growing in your eyes. Tell me where's my way...Desolate loving in your eyes. You used an' made my life so sweet. Step out like a God found child. I saw your eyes across the street. . Who would be the fool to take you?. Be more than just kind. Step into a life of maybe. Love is hard to find. . In the church of the poison mind. In the church of the poison mind. In the church of the poison mind. . Watch me clingling to the beat. I had to fight to make it mine. That religion you could sink in neat. Just move your feet an' you'll feel fine. . Who would be the fool to maybe. Trick a kiss in time?. Who am I to say that's crazy?. Love will make you blind. . In the church of the poison mind. In the church of the poison mind.

There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop. I have stood here before inside the pouring rain. With the world turning circles running 'round my brain. I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign. But it's my destiny to be the king of pain. There's a little black spot on the sun today. (That's my soul up there).

You need a love that's gonna last. I guess I should've closed my eyes. When you drove me to the place where your horses run free. 'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures. Of the jockeys that were there before me. Believe it or not, I started to worry. I wondered if I had enough class. But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right. And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?", Oh yeah. Little Red Corvette. Baby, you're much too fast. (Yes, you are). Little Red Corvette. You need to find a love that's gonna last. (Oh, oh).

É hora de caminhar pelas ruas. Smell the desperation. Sentir o cheiro do desespero. At least there's pretty lights. Pelo menos existem luzes bonitas. And though there's little variatios. E embora haja pouca variação. It nullifies the night. From overkill. Ela livra a noite do exagero. Day after day it reappears. Night after night my heartbeat, shows the fear.

That you're bad for me and I should turn you away. 'Cause they don't know about us. And they've never heard of love. I get a feeling when I look at you. Wherever you go now, I wanna be there too. They say we're crazy but I just don't care. And if they keep on talking, still they get nowhere. So I don't mind if they don't understand. When I look at you and you hold my hand. 'Cause they don't know about us. And they've never heard of love. (Do do-do-do). Why should it matter to us if they don't approve. (Do do-do-do). We should just take our chances while we've got nothin' to lose. Baby. There's no need for living in the past. Now I've found a love, I'm gonna make it last. I tell the others, don't bother me. 'Cause when they look at you they don't see what I see. No I don't listen to their wasted lines. Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs. 'Cause they don't know about us. And they've never heard of love. No I don't listen to their wasted lines. Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs. 'Cause they don't know about us.

And I know just how to scheme. I know just to when to face the truth. And then I know just to when to dream. And I know just to where to touch you. And I know just to what to prove. I know when to pull you closer. And I know when to let you lose. And I know the night is fading. And I know that time's gonna fly. And I'm never gonna tell you everything, I've got to tell you. But I know I've got to give it a try. And I know the roads to riches. And I know the ways to fame. I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em. And I always know the name of the game.

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun. Are streaming through the waves in your hair. And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes. Like a spotlight. The beating of my heart is a drum, and it's lost. And it's looking for a rhythm like you. You can take the darkness from the pit of the night. And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright, I've got to follow it. 'Cause everything I know. Well, it's nothing till I give it to you, alright. I can make the runner stumble. I can make the final block. And I can make every tackle, at the sound of the whistle. I can make all the stadiums rock. And I can make tonight forever. Or I can make it disappear by the dawn. And I can make you every promise that has ever been made. I can make all your demons be gone. But I'm never gonna make it without you. Do you really want to see me crawl?. And I'm never gonna make it like you do. Making love out of nothing at all. (Making love). Out of nothing at all. (Making love). Out of nothing at all. (Making love). Out of nothing at all.

Don't need someone to lean on. I know where there's an open door. But if I'm faced. With being replaced. I want you even more. So baby, say it isn't so. (It isn't so). Oh, oh, say it isn't so. (It isn't so). Oh, oh, no. Say it isn't so. (It isn't so). Whoa, say it isn't so. (It isn't so). Oh, oh, oh, yeah. (Say it). (Say it isn't so). (Say it). (Say it isn't so). (Say it).

There must be some other way. Don't have to. (Say it isn't). Some other way. (So say it isn't). Aah, you don't have to say. (Say it isn't)Looking out across the night-time. The city winks a sleepless eye. Hear her voice shake my window. Sweet seducing sighs. Get me out into the night-time. Four walls won't hold me tonight. If this town is just an apple. Then let me take a bite. If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature. Why, why does he do me that way?. If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature. Why, why does he do me that way?. Reaching out to touch a stranger. Electric eyes are everywhere. See that girl, she knows I'm watching. She likes the way I stare. If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature. Why, why does he do me that way?. If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature. Why, why does he do me that way?. I like livin' this way, I like lovin' this way. Looking out across the morning. The city's heart begins to beat. Reaching out, I touch her shoulder. I'm dreaming of the street. If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature. Why, why does he do me that way?. If they say, why, why? Ooh, tell 'em. Why, why does he do me that way?. If they say, why, why? Cha cha cha. Why, why does he do me that way?. If they say why, why, why? Ooh, tell 'em. Why, why does he do me that way?. If they say, why, why? Ooh, tell 'em. Why, why does he do me that way?. If they say, why, why? Da da da. Why, why does he do me that way?. I like livin' this wayThey put a parking lot on a piece of land. Where the supermarket used to stand. Before that they put up a bowling alley. On the site that used to be the local palais. That's where the big bands used to come and play. My sister went there on a Saturday. Come dancing. All her boyfriends used to come and call. Why not come dancing, it's only natural?. Another Saturday, another date. She would be ready but she'd always make 'em wait. In the hallway, in anticipation. He didn't know the night would end up in frustration. He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week. All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek. Come dancing,. That's how they did it when I was just a kid. And when they said come dancing, my sister always did. My sister should have come in at midnight. And my mom would always sit up and wait. It always ended up in a big row. When my sister used to get home late. Out of my window. I can see them in the moonlight. Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate. The day they knocked down the palais. My sister stood and cried. The day they knocked down the palais. Part of my childhood died, just died. Now I'm grown up and playing in a band. And there's a car park where the pale used to stand. My sister's married and she lives on an estate. Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait. She knows they get away with things she never could. But if I asked her I wonder if she would. Come dancing. Come on sister, have yourself a ball. Don't be afraid to come dancing, it's only natural. Come dancing, just like the palais on a Saturday. And all her friends will come dancing. Where the big bands used to playBaby you'll find*. There's only one love. Yours and mine. I've got so much love. And needing you so. My love for you. I'll never let go. I've got so much love. All I want is to hold you. Let me show how much I love you baby (show you). I don't mind and I don't mind (loving you). Girl I love you. There's no one above you. [Chorus:]. You are the sun. You are the rain. That makes my life this foolish game. You need to know. I love you so. And I'd do it all again and again. Tell me it's true. I can't believe you do what you do. I've got so much love. And my love you'll see. We'll stay together, just you and me. I've got so much love. Only you (know me). Tell me how to love you baby (show me). I don't mind and I don't mind (tell me). Girl, I love you. Always thinking of you. [Repeat Chorus:]. I know you know the way I feel. And I need your love for always. Cause when I'm with you. I fall in love. Again and again and again, baby.. [Repeat Chorus:]The deception with tact. Just what are you trying to say. You've got a blank face, which irritates. Communicate, pull out your party piece. . You see dimensions in two. State your case with black or white. But when one little cross leads to shots, grit your teeth. You run for cover so discreet. . Why don't they do what they say, say what you mean. Oh well, one thing leads to another. You told me something wrong. I know I listen too long  one thing leads to another. . The impression that you sell. Passes in and out like a scent. But the long face that you see. Comes from living close to your fears. . This is up, then I'm up but you're running out of sight. You've see no name on the walls and when one little bump. Leads to shock miss a beat. You run for cover and there's heat. . Why don't they do what they say, say what they mean. One thing leads to another. You told me something wrong. I know I listen too long one thing leads to another. Yeah, yeah, yeah. . One thing leads to another. . Then it's easy to believe. Somebody's been lying to me. But when the wrong word goes in the right ear. I know you've been lying to me. . It's getting rough, off the cuff. I've got to say enough's enough. Bigger the harder he falls but when the wrong antidote. Is like a bulge on the throat you run for cover in the heat. . Why don't they do what they say, say what they mean. One thing leads to another. You told me something wrong. I know I listen too long but then one thing leads to another. Yeah, yeah. . One thing leads to another. One thing leads to another. One thing leads to another. ...Zwei drei vier, one two three, it's easy to see. But it's not that I don't care so. 'Cause I hear it all the time. But they never let you know.

Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?. She said, "Babe you know, I miss Jill and Joe". And all my funky friends. But my street understanding. Was just enough to know what she really meant. And I got to thinking while she was talking. That I know she told the story. Of those special places that she goes. When she rides with the others in the subway. Singin', don't turn around, oh oh.

You used to walk along with me. And every step I take recalls. How much in love we used to be. Oh, how can I forget you, girl. When there is always something there to remind me?. Always something there to remind me. When shadows fall, I pass a small cafe. Where we would dance at night. And I can't help recalling. How it felt to kiss and hold you tight. Oh, how can I forget you, girl. When there is always something there to remind me?. Always something there to remind me. I was born to love her. And I will never be free. You'll always be a part of me. If you should find you miss the sweet. And tender love we used to share. Just come back to the places. Where we used to go and I'll be there.

In fact here's just another ordinary day. No April rain, no flowers bloom. No wedding Saturday within the month of June. But what it is, is something true. Made up of these three words that I must say to you. I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care. I just called to say I love you. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart. No summer's high, no warm July. No harvest moon to light one tender August night. No autumn breeze, no falling leaves. Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies. No Libra sun, no halloween. No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring. But what it is, though old so new. To fill your heart like no three words could ever do. I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care. I just called to say I love you. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care. I just called to say I love you. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart. Of my heart. Of my heartI feel so unsure. As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor. As the music dies something in your eyes. Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. I should have known better than to cheat a friend. And waste a chance that I'd been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. Time can never mend. The careless whispers of a good friend. To the heart and mind ignorance is kind. There's no comfort in the truth, pain is that all you'll find. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. I should have known better than to cheat a friend. And waste a chance that I'd been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. With or without your love. Tonight the music seems so loud. I wish that we could lose this crowd. Maybe it's better this way. We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say. We could have been so good together. We could have lived this dance forever. But now, who's gonna dance with me?. Please stay. I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend. I know you're not a fool. I should have known better than to cheat a friend. And waste a chance that I'd been given. So I'm never gonna dance again. The way I danced with you. (Now that you're gone). Now that you're gone. (Now that you're gone). Was what I did so wrong?. So wrong that you had to leave me alone?Dig if you will, the picture. Of you and I engaged in a kiss. The sweat of your body covers me. Can you my darling, can you picture this?. Dream if you can a courtyard. An ocean of violets in bloom. Animals strike curious poses. They feel the heat, the heat between me and you. How can you just leave me standing. Alone in a world that's so cold?. Maybe I'm just too demanding. Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold. Maybe you're just like my mother. She's never satisfied. Why do we scream at each other?. This is what it sounds like when the doves cry. Touch if you will, my stomach. Feel how it trembles inside. You've got the butterflies all tied up. Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride. How can you just leave me standing. Alone in a world so cold?. Maybe I'm just too demanding. Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold. Maybe you're just like my mother. She's never satisfied. Why do we scream at each other?. This is what it sounds like when doves cry. How can you just leave me standing. Alone in a world that's so cold?. Maybe I'm just too demanding.

When doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry. Don't cry. Oh yeah all right, oh yeah oh yeah. Oh yeah oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah. Oh yeah oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah. When doves cry, when doves cry. When doves cry. Ah, ah, ah, ooo. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ooo. When doves cry, don't cry. Darling don't cry. Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cryI come home in the mornin' light. My Mother says,"When you gonna live your life right?". Oh Mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones. And girls, they wanna have fun. Oh girls just wanna have fun. The phone rings in the middle of the night. My Father yells,"What you gonna do with your life?". Oh Daddy dear, you know you're still number one. But girls, they wanna have fun. Oh girls just wanna have. That's all they really want. Some fun. When the workin' day is done. Girls they wanna have fun. Oh girls just wanna have fun.   (Girls, they want). (Wanna have fun).

Girls just wanna have fun. ...You must understand. That the touch of your hand. Makes my pulse react. That it's only that thrill. Of boy meeting girl. Opposites attract. It's physical. Only logical. You must try to ignore. That it means more than that. Oh whats love got to do with it. What's love but a second hand emotion. What's love got to do with it. Who needs a heart. When a heart can be broken. It may seem to you. That I'm acting confused. When you're close to me. If I tend to look dazed. I've read it someplace. I've got cause to be. There's a name for it. There's a phrase for it. But whatever the reason. You do it for me. Oh whats love got to do with it. What's love but a second hand emotion. What's love got to do with it. Who needs a heart. When a heart can be broken. I've been taking on a new direction. But I have to say. I've been thinking about my own protection. It scares me to feel this way. What's love got to do, got do with it. What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion. What's love got to do, got to do with it. Who needs a heart when a heart can be brokenIt's Christmas time. There's no need to be afraid. At Christmas time. We let in light and we banish shade. . And in our world of plenty. We can spread a smile of joy. Throw your arms around the world. At Christmas time. . But say a prayer. Pray for the other ones. At Christmas time, it's hard. But when you're having fun. . There's a world outside your window. And it's a world of dreaded fear. Where the only water flowing. Is a bitter sting of tears. . And the Christmas bells that ring there. Are the clanging chimes of doom. We'll, tonight, thank God, it's them. Instead of you. . And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time. The greatest gift they'll get this year is life. Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow. Do they know it's Christmas time at all?. . Here's to you. Raise your glass for everyone. Here's to them. Underneath that burning sun. Do they know it's Christmas time at all?. .

You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline. Keep pushing me, keep pushing me. Keep pushing my love. Come on baby, come on darlingEvery time I think of you. I always catch my breath. And I'm still standing here. And you're miles away. And I'm wondering why you left. And there's a storm that's raging. Through my frozen heart tonight. I hear your name in certain circles. And it always makes me smile. I spend my time thinking about you. And it's almost driving me wild. And that's my heart that's breaking. Down this long distance line tonight. That I ain't missing you at all. Since you've been gone away. I ain't missing you at all. No matter what my heart might say. Well there's a message in the wild. And I'm sending you this signal tonight. You don't know, how desperate I've become. And it looks like I'm losing this fight. In your world, I have no meaning. Though I'm trying hard to understand. And it's my heart that's breaking. Down this long distance line. But I ain't missing you at all. Since you've been gone away. I ain't missing you at all. No matter what heart might say. And there's a message that I'm sending out. Like a telegraph to your soul. And if I can't bridge this distance. Stop this heartbreak overload. I ain't missing you at all. Since you've been gone away. I ain't missing you at all. No matter what my friends might say. I ain't missing you at all. See I can lie to myself these days. I ain't missing you at all. Doing fine baby, every thing's okay. 'Cause I ain't missing you. I ain't missing youLiving on free food tickets. Water in the milk from a hole in the roof. Where the rain came through. What can you do?. Tears from your little sister. Crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress. Without a patch for the party to go. But you know she'll get by. 'Cause she's living in the love of the common people. Smile's from the heart of a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can. It's a good thing you don't have a bus fare. It would fall through the hole in your pocket and you'd lose it. In the snow on the ground. You got to walk into town to find a job. Tryin' to keep your hands warm. When the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through. And chills you to the bone. Now you'd better go home where it's warm. Where you can live in a love of the common people. Smile from the heart of a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can. Living on a dream ain't easy. But the closer the knit, the tighter the fit. And the chills stay away. Keeping 'em in stride for family pride. You know that faith is in your foundation. And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation. But don't forget to pray. 'Cause making it strong were you belong. And we're living in the love of the common people. Smile's from the heart of a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can. Yes, we're living in the love of the common people. Smile's from the heart of a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can. Living in the love of the common people. Smile's from the heart of a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can. Living in the love of the common people. Smile's really hard on a family man. Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to. Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she canTo all the girls I've loved before. Who traveled in and out my door. I'm glad they came along. I dedicate this song to all the girls I've loved before. To all the girls I've once caressed. And may I say I've held the best. For helping me to grow. I owe a lot I know to all the girls I've loved before. The winds of change are always blowing. And every time I tried to stay. The winds of change continue blowing. And they just carried me away. To all the girls who shared my life. Who now are someone else's wives. I'm glad they came along. I dedicate this song to all the girls I've loved before. To all the girls who cared for me. Who filled my nights with ecstasy. They live within my heart. I'll always be a part of all the girls I've loved before. The winds of change are always blowing. And every time I tried to stay. The winds of change continue blowing. And they just carried me away. To all the girls we've loved before. Who traveled in and out our door. We're glad they came along. We dedicate this song to all the girls we've loved before. To all the girls we've loved before. Who traveled in and out our doors. We're glad they came along. We dedicate this song to all the girls we've loved beforeI'm all out of hope. One more bad break could bring a fall. When I'm far from home. Don't call me on the phone. To tell me you're alone. It's easy to deceive. It's easy to tease. But hard to get release. (Les yeux sans visage). Eyes without a face. (Les yeux sans visage). Eyes without a face. (Les yeux sans visage). Eyes without a face. Got no human grace. Your eyes without a face. I spend so much time. Believing all the lies. To keep the dream alive. Now it makes me sad. It makes me mad at truth. For loving what was you. (Les yeux sans visage). Eyes without a face. (Les yeux sans visage). Eyes without a face. (Les yeux sans visage). Eyes without a face. Got no human grace. Your eyes without a face. When you hear the music you make a dip. Into someone else's pocket then make a slip. Steal a car and go to Las Vegas oh, the gigolo pool. Hanging out by the state line. Turning Holy Water into wine. Drinking it down. I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip. Reading murder books tryin' to stay hip. I'm thinkin' of you, and you're out there so. Say your prayers. Say your prayers. Say your prayers. Now I close my eyes. And I wonder why. I don't despise. Now all I can do. Love what was once. So alive and new. But it's gone from your eyes. I'd better realize. (Les yeux sans visage). Eyes without a face. (Les yeux sans visage). Eyes without a face. (Les yeux sans visage). Eyes without a face. Got no human grace. Your eyes without a face. Such a human waste. Your eyes without a face. And now it's getting worseWar, war is stupid and people are stupid. And love means nothing in some strange quarters.

We belong to the thunder. We belong to the sound of the words. We've both fallen under. . Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong. We belong together. . Close your eyes and try to sleep now. Close your eyes and try to dream. Clear your mind and do your best to try. And wash the palette clean. . We can't begin to know it. How much we really care. I hear your voice inside me. I see your face everywhere. . Still you say. We belong to the light. We belong to the thunder. We belong to the sound of the words. We've both fallen under. . Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong. We belong together. . We belong to the light. We belong to the thunder. We belong to the sound of the words. We've both fallen under. . Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong. We belong together. . We belong to the lightGuess there are times. When we all need to share a little pain. And ironing out the rough spots. Is the hardest part when memories remain. And it's times like these. When we all need to hear the radio. 'Cause from the lips of some old singer. We can share the troubles we already know. Turn them on, turn them on. Turn on those sad songs. When all hope is gone. Why don't you tune in and turn them on. They reach into your room. Just feel their gentle touch. When all hope is gone. Sad songs say so much. If someone else is suffering enough. To write it down. When every single word makes sense. Then it's easier to have those songs around. Kick inside is in the line. That finally gets to you. And it feels so good to hurt so bad. And suffer just enough to sing the blues. So turn them on, turn them on. Turn on those sad songs. When all hope is gone. Why don't you tune in and turn them on. They reach into your room. Just feel their gentle touch. When all hope is gone. You know sad songs say so much. Sad songs, they say. Sad songs, they say. Sad songs, they say. Sad songs, they say so much. So turn them on, turn them on. Turn on those sad songs. When all hope is gone. Why don't you tune in and turn them on. They reach into your room. Just feel their gentle touch. When all hope is gone. You know sad songs say so much. When all hope is gone. You know sad songs say so much. When all the little bit of hope is gone. Sad songs say so much. When all the little bit of hope is gone. Sad songs say so much. When all hope is gone. Sad songs sayThree, four. Everybody's talking and no one says a word. Everybody's making love and no one really cares.

They're starving back in China so finish what you got. Nobody told me there'd be days like these. Nobody told me there'd be days like these. Nobody told me there'd be days like these. Strange days indeed, strange days indeed. Everybody's runnin' and no one makes a move. Everyone's a winner and nothing left to lose. There's a little yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu. Everybody's flying and no one leaves the ground. Everybody's crying and no one makes a sound. There's a place for us in movies you just gotta lay around. Nobody told me there'd be days like these. Nobody told me there'd be days like these. Nobody told me there'd be days like these. Strange days indeed, most peculiar, mama. Everybody's smoking and no one's getting high. Everybody's flying and never touch the sky. There's U F O's over New York and I ain't too surprised. Nobody told me there'd be days like these. Nobody told me there'd be days like these. Nobody told me there'd be days like these. Strange days indeed, most peculiar, mamaBruce Springsteen. Born In The U.s.a.. Cover Me. The times are tough now, just getting tougher.

Another illusion I chose to create. You don't know what you got until it's gone. And I found out just a little too late. I was acting as if you were lucky to have me.

Late at night I toss and turn and dream. of what I need. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night. He's gotta be strong. And he's gotta be fast. And he's gotta be fresh from the fight. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light. He's gotta be sure. And it's gotta be soon. And he's gotta be larger than life. Somewhere after midnight. In my wildest fantasy. Somewhere just beyond my reach. There's someone reaching back for me. Racing on the thunder end rising with the heat. It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night. He's gotta be strong. And he's gotta be fast. And he's gotta be fresh from the fight. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light. He's gotta be sure. And it's gotta be soon. And he's gotta be larger than life.

And the storm and the flood. I can feel his approach. Like the fire in my bloodI love you whether or not you love me. I love you even if you think that I don't. Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you. But I don't mind. Why should I mind. Why should I mind. What is love anyway. Does anybody love anybody anyway. What is love anyway. Does anybody love anybody anyway. Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear. Never worry never be sad. The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can. This is why I don't mind you doubting. What is love anyway. Does anybody love anybody anyway. What is love anyway. Does anybody love anybody anyway. And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be. The door always must be left unlocked. To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you. And not to spend the time just doubting. What is love anyway. Does anybody love anybody anyway. What is love anyway. Does anybody love anybody anyway. What is love anyway. Does anybody love anybody anyway. What is love anyway. Does anybody love anybody anyway. What is love anyway. Does anybody love anybody anyway. What is love anyway.

One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble. Can't be too careful with your company. I can feel the Devil walking next to me. Bangkok, Oriental setting. And the city don't know what the city is getting. The creme de la creme of the chess world. In a show with everything but Yul Brynner. Time flies, doesn't seem a minute. Since the Tirolean Spa had the chess boys in it. All change, don't you know that when you. Play at this level, there's no ordinary venue. It's Iceland or the Philippines. Or Hastings or, or this place. One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster. The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free. You'll find a God in every golden cloister. And if you're lucky then the God's a she. I can feel an angel sliding up to me. One town's very like another. When your head's down over your pieces, Brother. It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity. To be looking at the board, not looking at the city. Whaddya mean?. Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town. Tea girls, warm and sweet, warm, sweet. Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham Suite. "Get Thai'd", you're talking to a tourist. Whose every move's among the purest. I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine. One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble. Not much between despair and ecstasy. One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble. Can't be too careful with your company. I can feel the Devil walking next to me. Siam's gonna be the witness. To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness. This grips me more than would. A muddy old river or Reclining Buddha. But thank God, I'm only watching the game, controlling it. I don't see you guys rating. The kind of mate I'm contemplating. I'd let you watch, I would invite you. But the queens we use would not excite you. So you better go back to your bars, your temples. Your massage parlors.

Can't be too careful with your company. I can feel the Devil walking next to meThe power of love is a curious thing. Make a one man weep, make another man sing. Change a hawk to a little white dove. More than a feeling, that's the power of love. Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream. Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream. Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right. Power of love will keep you home at night. You don't need money, don't take fame. Don't need no credit card to ride this train. It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes. But it might just save your life. That's the power of love, that's the power of love. First time you feel it, it might make you sad. Next time you feel it, it might make you mad. But do be glad baby when you've found. That's the power makes the world go 'round. And it don't take money, don't take fame. Don't need no credit card to ride this train. It's strong and it's sudden, it can be cruel sometimes. But it might just save your life. They say that all in love is fair. Yeah, but you don't care. But you know what to do. When it gets hold of you. And with a little help from above. You feel the power of love. You feel the power of love. Can you feel it?. Hmmm. It don't take money and it don't take fame. Don't need no credit card to ride this train. Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel. You won't feel nothin' till you feel. You feel the power, just feel the power of love. That's the power, that's the power of love. You feel the power of love. You feel the power of love. Feel the power of loveIn 1965 Vietnam seemed like just another foreign war but it wasn't. It was different in many ways, as so were tose that did the fighting. In World War II the average age of the combat soldier was 26. In Vietnam he was 19. In-in-in Vietnam he was 19. The shooting and fighting of the past two weeks continued today. 25 miles west of Saigon. I really wasn't sure what was going on. Ni-ni-ni 19, 19, ni-19 19. In Vietnam the combat soldier typically served. A twelve month tour of duty. But was exposed to hostile fire almost everyday. Ni-ni-ni 19, Ni-ni-ni 19. Hundreds of thousands of men who saw heavy combat. In Vietnam were arrested since discharge. Their arrest rate is almost twice that of non-veterans of the same age. There are no accurate figures of how many of these men. Have been incarcerated. But a Veterans Administration study. Concludes that the greater of vets. Exposure to combat could more likely affect his chances. Of being arrested or convicted. This is one legacy of the Vietnam War. All those who remember the war. They won't forget what they've seen. Destruction of men in their prime. Whose average was 19. De-de-destruction. De-de-destruction. War, war. De-de-destruction, wa, wa, war, wa, war, war. De-de-destruction. War, war. After World War II the men came home together on troop ships. But the Vietnam vet often arrived home within 48 hours of jungle combat. Perhaps the most dramatic difference between. World War II and Vietnam was coming home. None of them received a hero's welcome. None of them received a heroes welcome, none of them, none of them. Ne-ne-ne, ne-ne-ne, none of them, none of them, none of them. None of them received a hero's welcome. None of them received a hero's welcome. According to a Veteran's Administration study. Half of the Vietnam combat veterans suffered from what. Psychiatrists call. Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder. Many vets complain of alienation, rage or guilt. Some succumb to suicidal thoughts. Eight to ten years after coming home. Almost eight hundred thousand men are still fighting the Vietnam War. De-de-destruction. Ni-ni-ni 19, 19, ni19 19. Ni-ni-ni 19, 19, ni-19 19. When we came back it was different, everybody wants to know. "How'd it happened to those guys over there?. There's gotta be something wrong somewhere. We did what we had to do. There's gotta be something wrong somewhere. People wanted us to be ashamed of what it made us. Dad had no idea what he went to fight and he is now. All we want to do is come home. All we want to do is come home. What did we do it for?. All we want to do is come home. Was it worth itMeeting you, with a view to a kill. Face to face in secret places, feel the chill. Night fall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making. Still oversea, could it be the whole world opening wide. A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside. The weekend's why. Until we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams. Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance into the fire. Choice for you, is the view to a kill. Between the shades, assassination's standing still. The first crystal tears, fall as snowflakes on your body. First time in years, to drench you skin with lovers rosy stain. A chance to find the phoenix for the flame. A chance to die. But can we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams. Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need. Dance into the fire, when all we see is the view to a killOut of the ruins. Out from the wreckage. Can't make the same mistake this time. We are the children. The last generation. We are the ones they left behind. And I wonder when. We are ever gonna change, change. Living under the fear. 'Til nothing else remains. We don't need another hero. We don't need to know the way home. All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome. Looking for something we can rely on. There's gotta be something better out there. Love and compassion, their day is coming. All else are castles built in the air. And I wonder when. We are ever gonna change, change. Living under the fear. 'Til nothing else remains. All the children say. We don't need another hero. We don't need to know the way home. All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome. So what do we do with our lives. We leave only a mark. Will our story shine like a light. Or end in the dark. Is it all or nothing. We don't need another hero. We don't need to know the way home. All we want is life beyond Thunderdome. All the children say. (We don't need another hero). We don't need another hero. (We don't need to know the way home).

And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow. What started out as friendship. Has grown stronger. I only wish I had the strength to let it show. I tell myself that I can't hold out forever. I said there is no reason for my fear. 'Cause I feel so secure when we're together. You give my life direction. You make everything so clear. And even as I wander. I'm keeping you in sight. You're a candle in the window. On a cold, dark winter's night. And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might. And I can't fight this feeling anymore. I've forgotten what I started fighting for. It's time to bring this ship into the shore. And throw away the oars, forever. 'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore. I've forgotten what I started fighting for. And if I have to crawl upon the floor. Come crashing through your door. Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore. My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you.

Had a band and we tried real hard. Jimmy quit, Jody got married. I should've known we'd never get far. Oh, when I look back now. That summer seemed to last forever. And if I had the choice. Yeah, I'd always wanna be there. Those were the best days of my life. Ain't no use in complaining. When you've got a job to do. Spent my evenings down at the drive-in. And that's when I met you, yeah. Standing on your mama's porch. You told me that you'd wait forever. Oh, and when you held my hand. I knew that it was now or never. Those were the best days of my life. Oh, yeah. Back in the summer of '69, oh. Man, we were killing time. We were young and restless. We needed to unwind. I guess nothing can last forever. Forever, no. Yeah. And now the times are changing. Look at everything that's come and gone. Sometimes when I play that old six-string. I think about you, wonder what went wrong. Standing on your mama's porch. You told me that it'd last forever. Oh, and when you held my hand. I knew that it was now or never. Those were the best days of my life. Oh, yeah.

Glory days, yeah they'll pass you by. Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye. Glory days, glory days. . There's this girl that lives up the block, back in school she could turn all the boys heads. Sometimes on friday i'll stop by and have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed. Her and her husband bobby, well they split up, i guess it's two years gone by. We just sit around talking about the old times, she says when she feels like crying she starts laughing thinking about. . Glory days.... . Think i'm going down to the well tonight and i'm gonna drink till i get my fill. I hope when i get older i don't sit around thinking about it, but i probably will.

All right boys keep it rocking now. We gonna go home now. Let's go!It doesn't hurt me, do you wanna feel how it feels. Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me. Do you wanna hear about the deal I'm making. You, it's you and me. And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God. And I'd get Him to swap our places. Be running up that road, be running up that hill. Be running up that building. Say if I only could, oh. You don't wanna hurt me. But see how deep the bullet lies. Unaware I'm tearing you asunder. Oh, there is thunder in our hearts. Is there so much hate for the ones we love. Oh, tell me we both matter don't we. You, it's you and me. It's you and me, you won't be unhappy. And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God.

'Cause I was a bit too leisurely. Seems that I was busy doing something close too nothing. But different than the day before. That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her. She walked in through the out door, out door. She wore a raspberry beret. The kind you find in a second hand store. Raspberry beret. And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more. Raspberry beret. I think I love her. Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me. If I planned to do her any harm. So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike. And-a we went riding down by old man Johnson's farm. I said now, overcast days never turned me on. But something about the clouds and her mixed. She wasn't to bright, but I could tell when she kissed me. She knew how to get her kicks. She wore a raspberry beret. The kind you find in a second hand store. Raspberry beret. And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more. Raspberry beret. I think I love her. The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof. And the horses wonder who you are. Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees. You feel like a movie star. Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest. But I tell ya, if I had the chance to do it all again. I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby I'm the most. With a girl as fine as she was then. Raspberry beret. The kind you find in a second hand store. Raspberry beret. If it was warm she wouldn't wear much more. Raspberry beret. I think I, think I, I think I love her. Raspberry beret. The kind you find in a second hand store. Raspberry beret. If it was warm she wouldn't wear much more. Raspberry beret. I think I loveWe're not scared to lose it all. Security throw through the wall. Future dreams we have to realize. A thousand skeptic hands. Won't keep us from the things we plan. Unless we're clinging to the things we prize. And do you feel scared - I do. But I won't stop and falter. And if we threw it all away. Things can only get better. Woh woh woh oh oh oh oh, woh woh woh oh oh oh oh. Treating today as though it was. The last, the final show. Get to sixty and feel no regret. It may take a little time. A lonely path, an uphill climb. Success or failure will not alter it. And do you feel scared - I do. But I won't stop and falter. And if we threw it all away. Things can only get better. Woh woh woh oh oh oh oh, woh woh woh oh oh oh oh. And do you feel scared - I do. But I won't stop and falter. And if we threw it all away. Things can only get better.

Now it seems you don't care for me. and I don't understand why. But it's much too late for goodbyes. Yes, it's much too late for goodbyes. Ever since you've been far away. I've been wanting to fly.

Try as hard as you can, I've tried as hard as I could. To make you see how important it is for me. Here is a plea from my heart to you. Nobody knows me as well as you do. You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease. That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these. Understand me. Understand me. Understand me. Understand me.

I never find out till I'm head over heels. Something happens and I'm head over heels. Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart. Don't, don't, don't throw it away, throw it away, throw it away. I made a fire, I'm watchin' it burn. Thought of your future. With one foot in the past, now just how long will it last. No, no, no, have you no ambitions. My mother and my brother's used to breathing clean air.   (Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age). And dreamin' I'm a doctor.   (Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby). It's hard to be man when there's a gun in your hand.   (Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age). Oh! I feel so. Something happens and I'm head over heels. I never find out till I'm head over heels. Something happens and I'm head over heels. Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart. Don't, don't, don't throw it away.

Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart. So sorry, I never meant to break your heart. But you broke mine. Kayleigh I just wanna say I'm sorry. But Kayleigh I'm too scared to pick up the phone. To hear you've found another lover to patch up our broken home.... Kayleigh I'm still trying to write that love song.

Too blind to see the writing on the wall. . A man can tell a thousand lies. I've learned my lesson well. Hope I live to tell. The secret I have learned, 'till then. It will burn inside of me. . I know where beauty lives. I've seen it once, I know the warmth she gives. The light that you could never see. It shines inside, you can't take that from me. . A man can tell a thousand lies. I've learned my lesson well. Hope I live to tell. The secret I have learned, 'till then. It will burn inside of me. . The truth is never far behind. You kept it hidden well. If I live to tell. The secret I knew then. Will I ever have the chance again?. . If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far. How would they hear the beating of my heart. Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?. How will they hear, when will they learn, how will they know?. . A man can tell a thousand lies. I've learned my lesson well. Hope I live to tell. The secret I have learned, 'till then. It will burn inside of me. . The truth is never far behind. You kept it hidden well. If I live to tell. The secret I knew then. Will I ever have the chance again?. . A man can tell a thousand lies. I've learned my lesson well. Hope I live to tell. The secret I have learned, 'till then. It will burn inside of me(Verse One). Goddess on the mountain top. Burning like a silver flame. The summit of beauty and love. And Venus was her name. . (Chorus). She's got it . Yeah, baby, she's got it. I'm your Venus, I'm your fire. At your desire. Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire. At your desire. . (Verse Two). Her weapons were her crystal eyes. Making every man a man. Black as the dark night she was. Got what no-one else had. Wa!. . (Chorus). . (Verse One). . (Chorus)I believe that children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside. Give them a sense of pride to make it easier. Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be. . Everybody searching for a hero. People need someone to look up to. I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs. A lonely place to be and so I learned to depend on me. . I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows. If I fail, if I succeed at least I live as I believe. No matter what they take from me. They can't take away my dignity. . Because the greatest love of all is happening to me. I found the greatest love of all inside of me. The greatest love of all is easy to achieve. Learning to love yourself it is the greatest love of all. . I believe that children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside. Give them a sense of pride to make it easier. Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be. . I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows. If I fail, if I succeed at least I live as I believe. No matter what they take from me. They can't take away my dignity. . Because the greatest love of all is happening to me. I found the greatest love of all inside of me. The greatest love of all is easy to achieve. Learning to love yourself it is the greatest love of all. . And if by chance, that special place. That you've been dreaming of. Leads you to a lonely place. Find your strength in loveThink about it, there must be higher love. Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above. Without it, life is wasted time. Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine. Things look so bad everywhere. In this whole world, what is fair?. We walk blind and we try to see. Falling behind in what could be. Bring me a higher love. Bring me a higher love, oh. Bring me a higher love. Where's that higher love, I keep thinking of?. Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on. Facing our fear and standing out there alone. A yearning, and it's real to me. There must be someone who's feeling for me. Things look so bad everywhere. In this whole world, what is fair?. We walk blind and we try to see. Falling behind in what could be. Bring me a higher love. Bring me a higher love, oh. Bring me a higher love. Where's that higher love, I keep thinking of?. Bring me a higher love. Bring me a higher love, oh. Bring me a higher love. I could rise above on a higher love. I will wait for it, I'm not too late for it. Until then, I'll sing my song. To cheer the night along. I could light the night up with my soul on fire. I could make the sun shine from pure desire. Let me feel that love come over me. Let me feel how strong it could be. Bring me a higher love. Bring me a higher love, oh. Bring me a higher love. Where's that higher love, I keep thinking of?. Bring me a higher love. Bring me a higher love, oh. Bring me a higher loveYour lights are on, but you're not home. Your mind is not your own. Your heart sweats, your body shakes.

So many promises never should be spoken. Now I know what loving you cost. Now we're up to talking divorce. And we weren't even married. On my own. Once again now. One more time. By myself. No one said it was easy, no one. But it once was so easy. Well I believed in love. Now here I stand, I wonder why. I'm on my own. Why did it end this way?. On my own.

It's true loveTonight it's very clear, as we're both lying here. There's so many things, I want to say. I will always love you, I would never leave you alone. Sometimes I just forget, say things I might regret. It breaks my heart to see you crying. I don't wanna lose you, I could never make it alone. I am a man, who will fight for your honor. I'll be the hero you're dreaming of. We'll live forever, knowing together that we. Did it all for the glory of love. You keep me standing tall, you help me through it all. I'm always strong when you're beside me. I have always needed you, I could never make it alone. I am a man who will fight for your honor. I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of. We'll live forever, knowing together that we. Did it all for the glory of love. Just like a knight in shining armor, from a long time ago. Just in time I will save the day, take you to my castle far away. I am a man who will fight for your honor. I'll be the hero that you're dreaming of. We're gonna live forever, knowing together that we. Did it all for the glory of love. We'll live forever, knowing together that we. Did it all for the glory of love. We did it all for love, we did it all for love. We did it all for love, we did it all for loveOh I, I just died in your arms tonight. It must have been something you said. I just died in your arms tonight. I keep looking for something I can't get. Broken hearts lie all around me. And I don't see an easy way to get out of this. Her diary, it sits on the bedside table. The curtains are closed, the cat's in the cradle. Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this. Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight. It must've been something you said. I just died in your arms tonight. Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight. It must've been some kind of kiss. I should've walked away. Is there any just cause for feeling like this?. On the surface I'm a name on a list. I try to be discreet, but then blow it again. I've lost and found, it's my final mistake. She's loving by proxy, no give and all take. 'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times. Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight. It must've been something you said. I just died in your arms tonight. Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight. It must've been some kind of kiss. I should've walked away. It was a long hot night. She made it easy, she made it feel right. But now it's over, the moment has gone. I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong. Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight. It must've been something you said. I just died in your arms tonight. Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight. It must've been some kind of kiss. I should've walked awayI'd say love was a magical thing. I'd say love would keep us from pain. Had I been there, had I been there. I would promise you all of my life. But to lose you would cut like a knife. So I don't dare, no I don't dare. 'Cause I've never come close in all of these years. You are the only one to stop my tears. And I'm so scared, I'm so scared. Take me back in time maybe I can forget. Turn a different corner and we never would have met. Would you care?. I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze. Little by little, you've brought me to my knees. Don't you care?. No, I've never come close in all of these years. You are the only one to stop my tears. I'm so scared of this love. And if all that there is, is this fear of being used. I should go back to being lonely and confused. If I could, I would, I swear[Run-D.M.C.]. Now there's a backseat/lover. That's always under/cover. And I talk til my daddy say.

It's a primitive clash. Venting years of frustrations. Bravely we hope. Against all hope. There is so much at stake. Seems our freedom's up. Against the ropes. Does the crowd understand?. Is it East versus West?. Or Man against Man?. Can any nation stand alone?. In the burning heart. Just about to burst. There's a quest for answers. An unquenchable thirst. In the darkest night. Rising like a spire. In the burning heart. The unmistakable fire. In the burning heart. In the warrious code. There's no surrender. Though his body says stop. His spirit cries - never!. Deep in our soul. A quiet ember. Know it's you against you. It's the paradox. That drives us on. It's a battle of wills. In the heat of attack. It's the passion that kills. The victory is yours alone. In the burning heart. Just about to burst. There's a quest for answers. An unquenchable thirst. In the darkest night. Rising like a spire. In the burning heart.

Oh you nasty boys. Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change, uh. Oh you nasty boys. . I don't like no nasty car, I don't like nasty food, uh. The only nasty thing I like is a nasty groove, uh.

Oh you nasty boysYou took a mystery and made me want it. You got a pedestal and put me on it. You made me love you out of feeling nothing. Something that you do, oh. And I was there and not dancing with anyone. You took a little, then you took me over. You set your mark on stealing my heart away. Crying, trying, anything for you. I'm in the middle of a chain reaction. You give me all the after midnight action. I wanna get you where. I can let you make all that love to me. I'm on a journey for the inspiration. To anywhere and there ain't no salvation. I need you to get me nearer to you. So you can set me free. We talk about love, love, love. We talk about love. We talk about love, love, love. We talk about love. You make me tremble when your hand moves lower. You taste a little then you swallow slower. Nature has a way of yielding treasure. Pleasure made for you, oh. You gotta plan, your future is on the run. Shine a light for the whole world over. You never find your love if you hide away. Crying, dying, all you gotta do is. Get in the middle of a chain reaction. You get a medal when you're lost in action. I wanna get your love all ready. For the sweet sensation, instant radiation. You let me hold you for the first explosion. We get a picture of our love in motion. My arms will cover, my lips will smother you. With no more left to say. We talk about love, love, love. We talk about love. You let me hold you for the first explosion. Arms will cover you, all you gotta do. Get in the middle of a chain reaction. You get a medal when you're lost in action. I wanna get your love all ready. For the sweet sensation, instant radiation. You let me hold you for the first explosion. We get a picture of our love in motion. My arms will cover, my lips will smother you. With no more left to say. Get in the middle of a chain reaction. You get a medal when you're lost in action. I wanna get your love all ready. For the sweet sensation, instant radiation. You let me hold you for the first explosionSpare a little candle, save some light for me. Figures up ahead moving in the trees. White skin in linen, perfume on my wrist. And the full moon that hangs over these dreams in the mist. Darkness on the edge, shadows where I stand. I search for the time on a watch with no hands. I want to see you clearly, come closer than this. But all I remember are the dreams in the mist. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away. Is it cloak 'n' dagger? Could it be spring or fall?. I walk without a cut through a stained glass wall. Weaker in my eyesight, the candle in my grip. And words that have no form are falling from my lips. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away. There's something out there I can't resist. I need to hide away from the pain. There's something out there I can't resist. The sweetest song is silence that I've ever heard. Funny how your feet in dreams never touch the earth. In a wood full of princes freedom is a kiss. But the prince hides his face from dreams in the mist. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night I live another life. These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside. Every moment I'm awake the further I'm awayA vacation in a foreign land, Uncle Sam does the best he can. You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now.

That came straight from a guy who claims he's tastin' her juice. Hear the one about Michael, some say he must be gay. I try to argue, but they said if he was straight he wouldn't move that way. Hear the one about Susan, some say she's just a tease. In a camisole she's six feet tall, she'll knock you to your knees. Look at all these rumors surroundin' me every day.

Hey, here is the story. Forget about the troubles in life. Don't you know, it's not easy. When you gotta walk upon that line. That's why, you need. That's why, this is what you need. I'll give you what you need. Don't you get sad and lonely. You need a change from what you do all day. Well there ain't no sense on crying. Just pick it up and throw it into shape. That's why, you need. That's why, this is what you need. I'll give you what you need. Hey you, won't you listen. This is not the end of it all. Don't you see there is a rhythm. I'll take you where you. Really need to be, oh yeah. I'll take you, I'll take you, where you wanna be. I'll take you, where you wanna beDon't get me wrong. If I'm looking kind of dazzled. I see neon lights. Whenever you walk by. Don't get me wrong. If you say hello and I take a ride. Upon a sea where the mystic moon. Is playing havoc with the tide. Don't get me wrong. Don't get me wrong. If I'm acting so distracted. I'm thinking about the fireworks. That go off when you smile. Don't get me wrong. If I split like lightacted. I'm only off to wander.

But there's something in the air. Don't get me wrong. If I come and go like fashion. I might be great tomorrow. But hopeless yesterday. Don't get me wrong. If I fall in the mode of fashion. It might be unbelievable. But let's not say so long. It might just be fantastic. Don't get me wrongEvery time I think of you. I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue. It's no problem of mine. But it's a problem I find. Living a life that I can't leave behind. But there's no sense in telling me. The wisdom of the fool won't set you free. But that's the way that it goes. And it's what nobody knows. Well every day my confusion grows. Every time I see you falling. I get down on my knees and pray. I'm waiting for that final moment. You say the words that I can't say. I feel fine and I feel good. I'm feeling like I never should. Whenever I get this way. I just don't know what to say. Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday. I'm not sure what this could mean. I don't think you're what you seem. I do admit to myself. That if I hurt someone else. Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be. Every time I see you falling. I get down on my knees and pray. I'm waiting for that final moment. You say the words that I can't sayBruce Springsteen. Born In The U.s.a.. My Hometown. I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand. Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man. I'd sit on his lap in that big old buick and steer as we drove through town. He'd tousle my hair and say son take a good look around. This is your hometown, this is your hometown. This is your hometown, this is your hometown. . In `65 tension was running high at my high school. There was a lot of fights between the black and white. There was nothing you could do. Two cars at a light on a saturday night in the back seat there was a gun. Words were passed in a shotgun blast. Troubled times had come to my hometown. My hometown, my hometown, my hometown. . Now main street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores. Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more. They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks. Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back to. Your hometown, your hometown, your hometown, your hometown. . Last night me and kate we laid in bed talking about getting out. Packing up our bags maybe heading south. I'm thirty-five we got a boy of our own now. Last night i sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good. Look around. This is your hometownI don't care what you say. You can give it away. Your money don't mean much to me. I've been out on my own. Gonna got it alone now 'cause that's the way it's got to be.

Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat. Beating like mine, looking at me. It's easy to see, you think you know just how I feel. If you do to me wrong and it won't take me long. Before my restless heart will heal. I'm looking for a love, love like mine. They tell me it's so hard to find. But I can feel it in the rhythm of the heartbeat in the street. Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat. Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat. Beating like mine, beating like mine. Tell me what you feel now without the heartbeat. Tell me is it real now without the heartbeat?. Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat. Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat. Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat.

It all seems like yesterday, not far away. Tropical the island breeze. All of nature, wild and free. This is where I long to be. La isla bonita. And when the samba played. The sun would set so high. Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes. Your Spanish lullaby. I fell in love with San Pedro. Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me. Te diso te amo. I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast. Tropical the island breeze. All of nature, wild and free. This is where I long to be. La isla bonita. And when the samba played. The sun would set so high. Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes. Your Spanish lullaby. I want to be where the sun warms the sky. When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by. Beautiful faces, no cares in this world. Where girl loves a boy and a boy loves a girl. Last night I dreamt of San Pedro. It all seems like yesterday, not far away. Tropical the island breeze.

To build a wall between us. We know they won't win. Now I'm towing my car. There's a hole in the roof. My possessions are causing me suspicion But there's no proof. In the paper today. Tales of war and of waste. But you turn right over to the T.V page. Hey now, Hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win. Now I'm walking again. To the beat of a drum. And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart. Only shadows ahead. Barely clearing the roof. Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief. Hey now, Hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, Hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. You know they won't win. Don't let them win. Hey now, Hey now. Hey now, Hey now. Hey now, Hey now. Don't let them win (They come, They come). Don't let them win (Hey now, Hey now)When I look back upon my life. it's always with a sense of shame. I've always been the one to blame. For everything I long to do. no matter when or where or who. has one thing in common too. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin. It's a sin. Everything I've ever done. Everything I ever do. Every place I've ever been. Everywhere I'm going to. It's a sin. At school they taught me how to be. so pure in thought and word and deed. They didn't quite succeed. For everything I long to do. no matter when or where or who. has one thing in common too. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin. It's a sin. Everything I've ever done. Everything I ever do. Every place I've ever been. Everywhere I'm going to. It's a sin. Father forgive me. I tried not to do it. Turned over a new leaf. then tore right through it. Whatever you taught me. I didn't believe it. Father you fought me. 'cause I didn't care. and I still don't understand. So I look back upon my life. forever with a sense of shame. I've always been the one to blame. For everything I long to do. no matter when or where or who. has one thing in common too. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin. It's a sin. Everything I've ever done. Everything I ever do. Every place I've ever been. Everywhere I'm going to I. It's a sin. Confiteor Deo omnipotenti vobis. fratres quia peccavi nimis cogitatione, verbo, opere. et omissione. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.There's things that you guess*. And things that you know. There's boys that you can trust. And girls that you don't. There's little things you hide. And little things that you show. Sometimes you think you're gonna get it. But you don't and that's just the way it goes. I swear I won't tease you. Won't tell you no lies. I don't need no bible. Just look in my eyes. I've waited so long baby. Now that we're friends. Every man's got his patience. And here's where my ends. I want your sex. I want you. I want your.....sex. It's playing on my mind. It's dancing on my soul. It's taken so much time. So why don't you just let me go. I'd really like to try. Oh, I'd really love to know. When you tell me you're gonna regret it. Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO!. I swear I won't tease you. Won't tell you no lies. I don't need no bible. Just look in my eyes. I've waited so long baby. Out in the cold. I can't take much more girl. I'm losing control. I want your sex. I want your love. I want your.....sex. It's natural. It's chemical (let's do it). It's logical. Habitual (can we do it?). It's sensual. But most of all...... Sex is something that we should do. Sex is something for me and you. Sex is natural - sex is good. Not everybody does it. Not everybody should. Sex is natural - sex is fun. Sex is best when it's....one on one. one on one. I'm not your father. I'm not your brother. Talk to your sister. I am a lover. C-c-c-c-come on. What's your defintion of dirty baby. What do you consider pornography. Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby. Don't you think it's time you had sex with me. What's your defintion of dirty baby. What do you call pornography. Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby. Don't you think it's time you had sex with me. Sex with me. Sex with me. Have sex with me. C-c-c-c-come onKissing like a bandit stealing time. Underneath the sycamore tree. Cupid by the hour sends valentines. To my sweet lover and me. Slowly but surely. Yours appetite is more than I knew. Sweetly, softly. I'm falling in love with you. Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell. A wishing well of butterfly tear. Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell. A wishing well of crocodile cheers. Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do. Right beside a riverboat gambler. Erotic images float through my head. I wanna be your midnight rambler. Quickly but quickly. The blood races through my veins. Quickly, loudly. I wanna hear those sugar bells ring. Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell. A wishing well of butterfly tears. Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell. A wishing well of crocodile cheers. Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell. A wishing well of butterfly tear, come on. Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell. A wishing well of crocodile cheers. I feel like going on. I feel like going on. Come on, come on. Erotic images float through my head. Your midnight rambler, baby. Take it. For you anywhere. I don't know I don't care. But all those years. I wanna be your midnight rambler, babyLike a warrior that fights and wins the battle. I know the taste of victory. Though I went through some nights consumed by the shadows. And was crippled emotionally. . Somehow I made it through the heartache. I escaped. I found my way out of the darkness, kept my faith. Kept my faith. . And the river was deep, I didn't falter. When the mountain was high, I still believed. When the valley was low, it didn't stop me. I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting for me. . With an endless desire, I kept on searching. Sure, in time our eyes would meet. And like the bridge is on fire, the hurt is over. One touch and you set me free. . I don't regret a single moment. Looking back, when I think of all those disappointments. I just laugh, I just laugh. . And the river was deep, I didn't falter. When the mountain was high, I still believed. When the valley was low, it didn't stop me. I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting for me. . So we were drawn together through destiny. I know this love we share was meant to beYou always wanted a lover. I only wanted a job. I've always worked for a living. How am I gonna get through?. How am I gonna get through?. I come here looking for money, got to have it. And end up living with love. Now you left me with nothing, can't take it. How am I gonna get through?. How am I gonna get through?. I bought you drinks, I brought you flowers. I read you books and talked for hours. Every day, so many drinks. Such pretty flowers, so tell me. What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?. What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?. What have I, what have I, what have I. Since you went away I've been hanging around. I've been wondering why I'm feeling down. You went away, it should make me feel better but I don't know. How I'm gonna get through?.   (What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?). How I'm gonna get through?.   (What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?). You always wanted me to be something I wasn't. You always wanted too much. Now I can do what I want to forever. How am I gonna get through?. How am I gonna get through?. At night the people come and go. They talk too fast and walk too slow. Chasing time from hour to hour. I pour the drinks and crush the flowers. What have I, what have I done to deserve this?. What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?. What have I, what have I, what have I. Since you went away I've been hanging around. I've been wondering why I'm feeling down. You went away, it should make me feel better but I don't know. How I'm gonna get through?.   (What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?). How I'm gonna get through?.

I'm gonna get through, baby.   (What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?). We don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight.   (What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?). We don't need to go to hell and back every night.   (What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?). You never ever left me, baby, think of me.   (What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?). Oh, babe.   (What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?). We don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight.   (What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?). We don't need to go to hell and back every night.

(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)Do you recall, not long ago. We would walk on the side walk. Innocent, remember?. All we did was care for each other. But the night was warm. We were bold and young. All around the wind blows. We would only hold on to let go. Blow a kiss, fire a gun. We need someone to lean on. Blow a kiss, fire a gun. All we need is somebody to lean on. Blow a kiss, fire a gun. We need someone to lean on. Blow a kiss, fire a gun. All we need is somebody to lean on. What will we do when we get old?. Will we walk down the same road?. Will you be there by my side?. Standing strong as the waves roll over. When the nights are long. Longing for you to come home. All around the wind blows. We would only hold on to let go. Blow a kiss, fire a gun. We need someone to lean on. Blow a kiss, fire a gun. All we need is somebody to lean on. Blow a kiss, fire a gun. We need someone to lean on.

It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky. . Somewhere out there if love can see us through (love can see us through). Then we'll be together somewhere out there.

Living on feelings. Touching you I feel it all again. Didn't we almost have it all. When love was all we had worth giving. The ride with you was worth the fall my friend. Loving you makes life worth living. Didn't we almost have it all. The nights we held on till the morning. You know you'll never love that way again. Didn't we almost have it all. The way you used to touch me felt so fine. We kept our hearts together down the line. A moment in the soul can last forever. Comfort and keep us. Help me bring the feeling back again.

The nights we held on till the morning. You know you'll never love that way again. Didn't we almost have it all. Didn't we have the best of times. When love was young and new. Couldn't we reach inside and find. The world of me and you. We'll never lose it again. Cause once you know what love is. You'll never let it end. Didn't we almost have it all. When love was all we had worth giving. The ride with you was worth the fall my friend. Loving you makes life worth living. Didn't we almost have it all. The nights we held on till the morning. You know you'll never love that way again. Didn't we almost have it all. Didn't we almost have it allGave you love, you did me wrong. Didn't know what to do. But baby, I'm strong, gonna get over you.

A walk on the water, is all that I need. But miracles are not happening. You're not even listening to me. Leaving you ain't easy now. But loving you's the harder part. You never want me for myself. And I've needed you right from the very start. Oh, won't you stay and try to. Give a little bit of heart and soul. Give a little bit of love to grow. Give a little bit of heart and soul. And don't you make me beg for love. Give a sign 'cos' I need to know. Give a little bit of heart and soul. Now listen to me I wish that I was wrong. But you don't feel that way. We drift apart with each passing day. You never seem to notice any more. Living in a fantasy, there's never any room to breath. Hoping every waking hour. You'll turn around and say that we can stay. Won't you even try to. Give a little bit of heart and soul. Give a little bit of love to grow. Give a little bit of heart and soul. And don't you make me beg for love. Give a sign 'cos' I need to know. Give a little bit of heart and soul. Somehow I lost my way. Looking to see something in your eyes. But lover will never compromise. There is the politics of life. Give a little bit of heart and soul. Give a little bit of love to grow. Give a little bit of heart and soul,. And don't you make me beg for love. Give a sign 'cos' I need to know.

Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes. You know it feels unfair. There's magic everywhere.. Look at me standing. Here on my own again. Up straight in the sunshine. No need to run and hide. It's so wonderful, wonderful life. No need to laugh and cry. It's so wonderful, wonderful life. Sun in your eyes. And heat is in your hair. They seem to hate you. Because you're there. And I need a friend. Oh, I need a friend. To make me happy. Not standing on my own. Look at me standing. Here on my own again. Up straight in the sunshine. No need to run and hide.

Died of a big disease with a little name. By chance, his girlfriend came across a needle. And soon she did the same. At home, there are seventeen year old boys. And their idea of fun. Is being in a gang called The Disciples. High on crack, totin' a machine gun. Time, times. Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church. And killed everyone inside. You turn on the telly and every other story. Is tellin' you somebody died. Sister killed her baby 'cuz she couldn't afford to feed it. And we're sending people to the moon. In September, my cousin tried reefer for the very first time. Now he's doing horse, it's June. Times, times. It's silly, no, when a rocket ship explodes. And everybody still wants to fly. Some say, a man ain't happy. Unless a man truly dies, oh, why?. Time, time. Baby make a speech, Star Wars fly. Neighbors just shine it on. But if a night falls and a bomb falls. Will anybody see the dawn?. Time, times. It's silly, no, when a rocket blows. And everybody still wants to fly. Some say, a man ain't happy, truly. Until a man truly dies. Oh why, oh why, sign o' the times. Time, time. Sign o' the times, mess with your mind. Hurry before it's too late. Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby. We'll call him Nate, if it's a boy. Time, timeThere's something I want to tell you. There's something I think that you should know. It's not that I shouldn't really love you. Let's take it slow. . When we get to know each other. And we're both feeling much stronger. Then let's try to talk it over. Let's wait awhile longer. . Let's wait awhile before it's too late. Let's wait awhile before we go too far. . Remember that special night. When all of the stars where shining bright. We made our first endeavor. To stay together. . We made our very first promise. To love, to share and be real honest. But on that very first night. It wasn't quite right. . Let's wait awhile before it's too late. Let's wait awhile, our love will be great. Let's wait awhile before we go too far. . I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show. To save some for later so our love can be greater. . You said you would always love me. Remember, I said the same thing too. You don't have to be frightened with my love. Because, I'll never give up on you. . Let's wait awhile, awhile before it's too late. You know you can't rush love, love. . Let's wait awhile before it's too late. Let's wait awhile, our love will be great. Let's wait awhile before we go too far. . Let's wait awhile before it's too late. Let's wait awhile, our love will be great. Let's wait awhile before we go too far. . I promise, I'll be worth the waitWhat did you think. I would do At This Moment. When you're standing before me. With tears in your eyes. Trying to tell me that you. Have found you another. And you just don't love me no more. What did you think. I would say At This Moment. When I'm faced with the knowledge. That you just don't love me. Did you think I would curse you. Or say things to hurt you. Cause you just don't love me no more. Did you think I could hate you. Or raise my hands to you. Now, come on, you know me too well. How could I hurt you. When Darlin' I love you. And you know, I'd never, never hurt you. What do you think. I would give At This Moment. If you'd stay, I'd subtract. Twenty years from my life. I'd fall down on my knees. Kiss the ground that you walk on. If I could just hold you againWhen lights go down, I see no reason. For you to cry, we've been through this before. In every time, in every season. God knows I've tried. So please don't ask for more. Can't you see it in my eyes?. Though this might be our last goodbye. Carrie. Carrie. Things they change my friend. Woh ohh. Carrie. Carrie. Maybe we'll meet again. Somewhere, again. I read your mind with no intentions. Of being unkind, I wish I could explain. It all takes time. A whole lot of patience. If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain?. Can't you see it in my eyes?. Though this might be our last goodbye. Ohh ho ho. Carrie. Carrie. Oh, things they change my friend. Woh ohh. Carrie. Carrie. Maybe we'll meet again. Ohh. Can't you see it in my eyes?. Though this might be our last goodbye.   (Ohh ho ho).

I'm going to Graceland, Graceland. In Memphis, Tennessee. I'm going to Graceland. Poor boys and pilgrims with families. And we are going to Graceland. My traveling companion is nine years old. He is the child of my first marriage. But I've reason to believe. We both will be received. In Graceland. She comes back to tell me she's gone. As if I didn't know that. As if I didn't know my own bed. As if I'd never noticed. The way she brushed her hair from her forehead. And she said losing love. Is like a window in your heart. Everybody sees you're blown apart. Everybody sees the wind blow. I'm going to Graceland. Memphis, Tennessee. I'm going to Graceland. Poor boys and pilgrims with families. And we are going to Graceland. And my traveling companions. Are ghosts and empty sockets. I'm looking at ghosts and empties. But I've reason to believe. We all will be received. In Graceland. There is a girl in New York City. Who calls herself the human trampoline. And sometimes when I'm falling, flying. Or tumbling in turmoil I say. Oh so this is what she means. She means we're bouncing into Graceland. And I see losing love. Is like a window in your heart. Everybody sees you're blown apart. Everybody feels the wind blow. In Graceland, in Graceland. I'm going to Graceland. For reasons I cannot explain. There's some part of me wants to see Graceland. And I may be obliged to defend. Every love, every ending. Or maybe there's no obligations now. Maybe I've got a reason to believe. We all will be received. In Graceland. In Graceland, in Graceland, in Graceland. I'm going to Graceland[Instrumental]Breakout. When explanations make no sense.

I feel resistance as I open my eyes. Someone's fooling. I've found a way to break through. This cellophane line. 'Cause I know what's going on. In my own mind. Am I living in a box. Am I living in a cardboard box?. Am I living in a box. Am I living in a cardboard box?. Am I living in a box?. Life goes in circles. Around and around, circulating. I sometimes wonder. What's moving underground, I'm escaping. I've found a way to break through. This cellophane line. 'Cause I know what's going on. In my own mind. Am I living in a box. Am I living in a cardboard box?. Living, I can't stand no more living. Living, living. Am I living in a box. Am I living, am I living, am I living?. Am I living, am I living, am I living?. Am I living in a box. Am I living in a cardboard box?. Am I living in a box. Am I living in a cardboard box?. Am I living in a box. Am I living in a cardboard box?Hit the beat now. Lost in emotion. Some guys will promise you a marriage made in heaven. But I'm gonna stick to my guns. Like waiting for that love that I might be getting. My dreams have yet begun, oh baby. Am I a fool 'cause I don't know. Just how you feel?. And is my love for you?. Oh, I can't conceal. Oh, I'm lost in emotion. Telling you things you really shouldn't know. Oh baby, I'm lost in emotion. Am I a fool? At least my friends think so. Qu-sera, que-sera. Baby, whatever will be?. Que-sera, que-sera. Truly you and me. Just how true are the rumors I am hearing. About the crush you have on me?. Oh baby, I'm blind 'cause I just don't see it. But I wanna believe what they see. I find myself telling you things. I don't even tell my best friend. I keep showing emotions not knowing. Just where it all stands for us. From time to time I wonder. What I am in your heart. And even though I don't live there yet. I'm afraid, it will be cold and dark. I'm lost in emotion. Telling you things you really shouldn't know. Oh, baby, I'm lost in emotion. Am I a fool? At least my friends think so. Qu-sera, que-sera. Baby, whatever will be?. Que-sera, que-sera. Truly you and me, oh no. Baby, am I a fool 'cause I don't know. Just how you feel?. And is my love for you?. Oh, I can't conceal. Hit the beat now with my feeling. I hit the ceiling with big emotions. I can't be dealing, I wanna be with you. But I don't know how in my heart. Babe, I can feel the beat now. Lost in emotion. Lost in emotion. Lost in emotion. Lost, my baby, you know that I'm lost. My baby, lost in emotion, my baby. Lost in emotion, lost in emotion, lostI hold you in my arms as the band plays. What are those words whispered baby just as you turn away. I saw you last night out on the edge of town. I wanna read your mind and know just what i've got in this new thing i've found. So tell me what i see when i look in your eyes. Is that you baby or just a brilliant disguise. . I heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow. I saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow. Well i've tried so hard baby but i just can't see. What a woman like you is doing with me. So tell me what i see when i look in your eyes. Is that you baby or just a brilliant disguise. . Now look at me baby struggling to do everything right. And then it all falls apart when out go the lights. I'm just a lonely pilgrim i walk this world in wealth. I want to know if it's you i don't trust 'cause i damn sure don't trust. Myself. . Now you play the loving woman i'll play the faithful man. But just don't look too close into the palm of my hand. We stood at the alter the gypsy swore our future was right. But come the wee wee hours maybe baby the gypsy lied. So when you look at me you better look hard and look twice. Is that me baby or just a brilliant disguise. . Tonight our bed is cold. I'm lost in the darkness of our love. God have mercy on the man. Who doubts what he's sure ofAll that time I was searching, nowhere to run to, it started me thinking,. Wondering what I could make of my life, and who'd be waiting,. Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,. Crying at the top of my voice, and no one listening,. All this time, I still remember everything you said. There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.. Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,. You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,. Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,. You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.. So listen, listen to me,. Ooh you must believe me,. I can feel your eyes go thru me,. But I don't know why.. Ooh I know you're going, but I can't believe. It's the way that you're leaving,. It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,. I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to. I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,. All this time, I still remember everything you said, oh. There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.. Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,. You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,. Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,. You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.. So listen, listen to me,. I can feel your eyes go thru me. It seems I've spent too long. Only thinking about myself - oh. Now I want to spend my life. Just caring bout somebody else.. Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,. You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,. Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,. You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.. You know I love you, but I just can't take this,. You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,. Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,. You know I want to, but I'm in too deep...I feel so extraordinary. Something's got a hold on me. I get this feeling I'm in motion. A sudden sense of liberty. I don't care 'cause I'm not there. And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow. Again and again I've taken too much. Of the things that cost you too much. I used to think that the day would never come. I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun. My morning sun is the drug that brings me near. To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear. I used to think that the day would never come. That my life would depend on the morning sun. When I was a very small boy. Very small boys talked to me. Now that we've grown up together. They're afraid of what they see. That's the price that we all pay. Our valued destiny comes to nothing. I can't tell you where we're going. I guess there's just no way of knowing. I used to think that the day would never come. I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun. My morning sun is the drug that brings me near. To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear. I used to think that the day would never come. That my life would depend on the morning sun. I feel so extraordinary. Something's got a hold on me. I get this feeling I'm in motion. A sudden sense of liberty. The chances are we've gone too far. You took my time, and you took my money. Now, I fear you've left me standing. In a world that's so demanding. I used to think that the day would never come. I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun. My morning sun is the drug that brings me near. To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear. I used to think that the day would never come. That my life would depend on the morning sun. I used to think that the day would never come. I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun. My morning sun is the drug that brings me near. To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear. I used to think that the day would never come. That my life would depend on the morning sun. Morning sun. Morning sun. Morning sun. Morning sun. Morning sun. Morning sunI see me with you and all the things you do. Keep turning round and round in my mind. Forget the weather we should always be together. And any other thought is unkind. To have you with me I would swim the seven seas. I need you as my guide and my light. My love is a flame that burns in your name. We'll be together, we'll be together tonight. We'll be together, yeah. We'll be together, yeah. We'll be together, yeah. I see you with me and all I want to be. Is dancing here with you in my arms. Forget the weather we should always be together. I'll always be a slave to your charms.

We'll be together, we'll be together tonightMy baby don't care for shows. My baby don't care for clothes. My baby just cares for me. My baby don't care for cars and races.

I lit a cigarette, picked up a monkey, start to go. The sun was spitting fire, the sky was blue as ice. I felt a little tired, so I watched 'Miami Vice'. .

Elvis landed in a rocket, rocket, rocket ship. Healed a couple of leapers and disappeared. But where was his beard. . A shadow from the sky, much too big to be a bird. A screaming, crashing noise louder than I've ever heard. It looked like two big silver trees that somehow learned to soar. Suddenly a summer breeze and a mighty lion's roar. .

Every time i'm telling secrets. I remember how it used to be. And i realized how much i miss you. And i realize how it feels to be free. . Now i see i'm up to no good (no, no, no).

While our moment was passing us by?. Oh I am here. Waiting for your change of heart. It just takes a beat to turn it around. Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart. At the edge of my seat, please turn it around. Days go by leaving me with a hunger. I could fly back to when we were younger. When adventures like cars we would ride. And the years lied ahead still untried. While I stand here. Waiting for your change of heart. It just takes a beat to turn it around. Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart. At the edge of my seat, please turn it around. Blind leading blind, never feel the laughter. Search through time, nothing reveals the answer. If it's truth that you're looking to find. It is nowhere outside of your mind. I bide my time. Waiting for your change of heart. It just takes a beat to turn it around. Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart. At the edge of my seat, please turn it around. Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart. It just takes a beat to turn it around. Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart. At the edge of my seat, please turn it around. And I'm waiting for your change of heart. Waiting for your change of heartYou dress me up, I'm your puppet. You buy me things, I love it. You bring me food, I need it. You give me love, I feed it. And look at the two of us in sympathy. With everything we see. I never want anything, it's easy. You buy whatever I need. But look at my hopes, look at my dreams. The currency we've spent. I love you; you pay my rent. I love you; you pay my rent. You phone me in the evening on hearsay. And bought me caviar. You took me to a restaurant off Broadway. To tell me who you are. We never ever argue, we never calculate. The currency we've spent. I love you; you pay my rent. I love you; you pay my rent. I love you; you pay my rent. I'm your puppet. I love it. And look at the two of us in sympathy. And sometimes ecstasy. Words mean so little, and money less. When you're lying next to me. But look at my hopes, look at my dreams. The currency we've spent. I love you; you pay my rent. I love you; you pay my rent. Ooh, I love you; you pay my rent. Look at my hopes, look at my dreams. The currency we've spent. I love you; you pay my rent. I love you; you pay my rent. Look at my hopes, look at my dreams. The currency we've spent. I love you; you pay my rent. I love you; you pay my rent. I love you; you pay my rent (It's easy, it's so easy). You pay my rent (It's easy, it's so easy). You pay my rent (It's easy, it's so easy). I love you (It's easy, it's so easy). (It's easy, it's so easy). (It's easy, it's so easy). (It's easy, it's so easy). (It's easy, it's so easy). (It's easy, it's so easy). (It's easy, it's so easy)Our dad would send us to our room. He'd be the voice of doom. He said that we would thank him later. All day he was solid as a rock. But by eight o'clock. We'd be crumbling. One night, my brother Joe and me. Climbed down the family tree. That grew outside our bedroom window. We ran though we knew it couldn't last. Running from the past. From things that we were born to be. Looking back it's so bizarre. It runs in the family. All the things we are. On the back seat of the car. With Joseph and Emily. We only see so far. And we all have our daddy's eyes. Looking back it's so bizarre. Dad rang the officer in charge. A man so large. He barely fit his circumstances. He said, "Two kids out on the street. Were picked up on the beat. And in the station". So there's me with Emily and Joe. Daddy driving home. All heading in the same direction. He knew no matter what the breaks. We'd make the same mistakes. Couldn't take his eyes of Joe and me. Looking back it's so bizarre. It runs in the family. All the things we are. On the backseat of the car. With Joseph and Emily. We only see so far. And we all have our daddy's eyes. Looking back it's so bizarre. It runs in the family. All the things we are. Looking back it's so bizarre. Like a dream within a dream. We're all somewhere in between. Like a drummer plays his drum. Like a father like a son. And your gonna have to face the music, oh yeah. Face the music. Hey hey. We keep it running in the family. Hey hey. We keep it coming in the family. Looking back it's so bizarre. It runs in the family. All the things we are. On the backseat of the car. With Joseph and Emily. We only see so far. 'Cause we all have our daddy's eyes. Looking back it's so bizarre, oh yeah. Running in the family. Running in the family. And we all have our daddy's eyes. Looking back it's so bizarre, oh yeah. Running in the familyI ain't much on Casanova. Me and Romeo ain't never been friends. Can't you see how much I really love you?. Gonna sing it to you time and time again. Oh, Casanova, Casanova.

Leave these scattered hours behind me. And speed myself to you. . I choose never to forget. I want our lips to kiss and our limbs to entwine. Let our bodies be twisted but never our minds. . Is this love?. Is this love?. Is this love?. Is this love?. . Set to work idle hands. Shake these thoughts. Had I planned them they never would be teasing me. As viciously as these. . I would not have believed you. Had I never seen. Now you and I are intimately pictured. In my dreams. I could not forsake you or fall tumbling away. And if I live in wonderland. I'm better off this way. . I choose never to forget. I want our lips to kiss and our limbs to entwine. Let our bodies be twisted but never our minds. . Is this love?. Is this love?.

They say you got a broken heart. I heard a rumour. . I heard a rumour. They say you got a broken heart. I heard a rumour. Yes I did, boyWhen I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall. And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call. Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove. For the first time in my life, I see I need love. There I was giggling about the games. That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names. Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn. 'Coz I said to myself look what you've done to her. I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels. All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal. Playing make believe pretending that I'm true. Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you. Saying amor, kissing you on the ear. Whispering I love you and I'll always be here. Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found. A desire for true love floating around. Inside my soul because my soul is cold. And half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old. But the other half needs affection and joy. And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy. I need love. I need love. Romance sheer delight how sweet. I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete. You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle. I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle. I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat. Kiss you on the cheek and say ooo girl you're so sweet. It's deja vu whenever I'm with you. I could go on forever telling you what I do. But where you at you're neither here or there. I swear I can't find you anywhere. Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug. This love search is really making me bug. And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen. Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean. Fantasy's can run but they can't hide. And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside. I need love. I need love. I wanna kiss you, hold you never scold you just love you. Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you. Grind moan and never be alone. If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone. Can't you hear it in my voice, I need love bad. I've got money but love's something I've never had. I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all. I love you more than a man who's ten feet tall. I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes. We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed. Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal. You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel. It's like a dream land, I can't lie I never been there. Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share. Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet. I swear to you this is something I'll never forget. I need love. I need love. See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer. A play boy on the run I need something that's stronger. Friendship, trust honor respect admiration. This whole experience has been such a revelation. It's taught me love and how to be a real man. To always be considerate and do all I can. Protect you you're my lady and you mean so much. My body tingles all over from the slightest touch of your hand. And understand I'll be frozen in time. Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine. If I find you girl I swear I'll be a good man. I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands. I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive. I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive. I'll search the whole world for that special girl. When I finally find you watch our love unfurl. I need love. I need love. Girl, listen to me. When I be sittin' in my room all alone, staring at the wall. Fantasies, they go through my mind. And I've come to realize that I need true love. And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen. I'll be waiting, I love youhI'll do anything. For my sweet sixteen. And I'll do anything. For little run away child.

And the last one I had made me cry. So I don't want to learn to hold you. Touch you, think that you're mine. Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy.

I see the kids in the street. With not enough to eat. Who am I, to be blind?. Pretending not to see their needs. A summer's disregard. A broken bottle top. And a one man's soul. They follow each other on. The wind ya' know. 'Cause they got nowhere to go. That's why I want you to know. I'm starting with the Man In The Mirror. I'm asking him to change his ways. And no message could have. Been any clearer. If they wanna make the world. A better place. Take a look at yourself. And then make a change. (Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah). I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love. It's time that I realize. That there are some with no home. Not a nickel to loan. Could it be really me. Pretending that they're not alone?. A willow deeply scarred. Somebody's broken heart. And a washed - out dream. (Washed - out dream). They follow the pattern of. The wind, ya' see. Cause they got no place to be. That's why I'm starting with me. I'm starting with the Man In The Mirror. (Ooh!). I'm asking him to change his ways. (Ooh!). And no message could have. Been any clearer. If you wanna make the world.

Life is much more simple when you're young. Come on essa vida e. That's the way life is. That's the way life is*. Although we see the world through different eyes. We share the same idea of paradise. So don't search in the stars for signs of love. Look around your life you'll find enough. Why do you want to sit alone in gothic gloom. surrounded by the ghost of love that haunt your room?. Somewhere there's a different door to open wide. You gotta throw those skeletons out of your closet and come outside. So you will see a brand new day. The troubles in your mind will blow away. It's easy to believe they're here to stay. but you won't find them standing in your waySunblock. Miscellaneous. First Time. In control, I can feel it. And it's in control, I can feel it.

And the first ray of sun. I can feel it inside. Something new has begun. And it's taking control. Of my body and mind. It began when I heard I love you. For the very first time. For the very first time. For the very first time. For the very first time. In control, in control. My body control. My body control. I can feel it. And it's in control. My body control.

And you gotta explore. Even though you're not sure. Till the moment arrives. There he is and you know you're in love. For the very first time (6x). For the very first timeAnother night slowly closes in. And I feel so lonely. Touching heat freezing on my skin. I pretend you still hold me. I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep. I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you. I can't believe you're gone. You were the first, you'll be the last. Wherever you go, I'll be with you. Whatever you want, I'll give it to you. Whenever you need someone. To lay your heart and head upon. Remember, after the fire, after all the rain. I will be the flame. I will be the flam. Watching shadows move across the wall. I feel so frightened. I wanna run to you, I wanna call. But I've been hit by lightning. Just can't stand up for fallin' apart. Can't see through this veil across my heart, over you. You'll always be the one. You were the first, you'll be the last. Wherever you go, I'll be with you. Whatever you want, I'll give it to you. Whenever you need someone. To lay your heart and head upon.. Remember, after the fire, after all the rain. I will be the flame. I will be the flame. I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep.

Cos suddenly. You came, and changed the way I feel. No one could love you more. Because you came and turned my life around. No one could take your place. I've never felt good with permanent things.

There was a rapper that was rapping to a beat that was wack. They was going through the motions out on the dance floor. And when the rapper was done, they wasn't yelling encore. The people were tired of the same old groove. They wanted something def, something new and improved. Something easy to do but hard to resist. "I got something for y'all, what do you call it the twist". Come on, baby, let's do the twist. Chubby Checker and The Fat Boys, we're doing the twist. Take us by our little hand and go like this. We, we, we broke into the booth and the record stacks. Came up with "The Twist" and we were scratching the track. People started jamming hard to the funky sound. Did the twist down and up, then up and down. Then I heard somebody yell, yo, Chubby's here. The people took a little pause, just to stop and stare. He said "I'll show you people, how to twist with style. Cause I've been doing the twist for a long, long while". Oh, you should see Prince Markie Dee. Check out that Kool Rock, he's rocking like me.

You might feel good around me, now back it up. Your rhythm is the power, to move me. It's something you control, completely. I don't want your love, I don't want your love.   (I don't what your love). I don't want your love to bring me down.   (I don't what your love).   (I don't what your love, I don't what your love). I don't want your love so turn it around.   (I don't what your love).   (I don't what your love, I don't what your love). I don't want your love.   (I don't what your love). I don't want your love.   (I don't what your love). I don't want your loveThough you're not here. Since you said we're through. It seems like years. Time keeps dragging on and on. And forever's been and gone. Still I can't figure what went wrong. I'd still do anything for you. I'll play your game. You hurt me through and through. But you can have your way. I can pretend each time I see you. That I don't care and I don't need you. And though you'll never see me crying. You know inside I feel like dying. And I'd do anything for you. In spite of it all. I've learned so much from you. You made me strong. But don't you ever think that I don't love you. That for one minute I forgot you. But sometimes things don't work out right. And you just have to say goodbye. I hope you find someone to please you. Someone who'll care and never leave you. But if that someone ever hurts you. You just might need a friend to turn to. And I'd do anything for you. I'll give you up. If that's what I should do. To make you happy. I can pretend each time I see you. That I don't care and I don't need you. And though inside I feel like dying. You know you'll never see me crying. Don't you ever think that I don't love you. That for one minute I forgot you. But sometimes things don't work out right. And you just have to say goodbyeThere was a time when. Broken hearts and broken dreams were over. There was a place where. All you could do was wish on a four leaf clover. . But now is a new time. There is a new place. Where dreams just can't come true. It started the day when I left you. . I could never love again the way I loved you. I could never cry again like I did when I left you. And when we said goodbye. Oh, the look in your eyes. Just left me beside myself without your heart. (Without your heart). I could never love again now that we're apart. . When I was sorry. It was too late to turn around and tell you so.   (Turn around). There was no reason, there was no reason. Just a foolish beat of my heart. . I could never love again the way I loved you. I could never cry again like I did when I left you. And when we said goodbye. Oh, the look in your eyes. Just left me beside myself without your heart. (Without your heart). I could never love again now that we're apart. . Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody. Don't you see the tears are falling down my face, since you went away. Break my heart, you slipped away. Didn't know I was wrong never meant to hurt you now you're gone. . I could never love again now that we're apart. (Now that we're apart). I could never love again now that we're apartWhy can't you do it?. Why can't you set your monkey free?. Always giving into it. Do you love your monkey or do you love me?. Why can't you do it?. Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?. Monkey with a monkey monkey. La la la. Oh, I count to ten. But I don't know how. And I don't know when. To open my eyes. Baby if you kiss me again. Like you did just now. Like you did just then. Do it again. I've had the rest. Now it's time I had the best. So you tell me. That you won't do anymore. Well I'd write your heart a letter. But I think you know me better. If I keep on asking baby, maybe. I'll get what I'm asking for. Why can't you do it?. Why can't you set your monkey free?. Always giving in to it. Do you love your monkey or do you love me?. Why can't you do it?. Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?. Monkey, with a monkey, monkey. La la la. Oh, I hate your friends. But I don't know how and I don't know when. To open your eyes. Yes, the monkey's back again. Do you want him now like you did back then?. I tried my best but your head is such a mess. So I guess that I don't want you anymore. Well you say you care about me. That you just can't do without me. But you keep on dancin' baby. 'Til that monkey has you on the floor. Why can't you do it?. Why can't you set your monkey free?. Always giving into it. Do you love the monkey or do you love me?. Why can't you do it. Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?. Monkey, with a monkey, monkey. La la la. Don't look now. There's a monkey on your back. Don't look now. There's a monkey on you. Don't look now. There's a monkey on your back. Don't look now. There's a monkey on you. So you tell me. That you won't do anymore. If I keep on askin' baby, maybe. I'll get what I'm askin' for. Why can't you do it?. Why can't you set your monkey free?. Always giving into it. Do you love the monkey or do you love me?. Why can't you do it?. Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?. Monkey, with a monkey, monkey. La la la. Why can't you do it?.

Monkey, with a monkey, monkey. La la laYou are far, when I could have been your star. You listened to people, who scares you to death. And from my heart. Strange that you were strong enough to even make a start. But you'll never find peace of mind, till you listen to your heart. People, you can never change the way they feel. Better let them do just what they will, for they will. If you let them steal your heart from you. People, will always make a lover feel a fool. But you knew I loved you. We could have shown them all. We should have seen love through. Fooled me with the tears in your eyes. Covered me with kisses and lies. So goodbye. But please don't take my heart. You are far, I'm never gonna be your star. I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart. Maybe I'll be strong enough, I don't know where to start. But I'll never find peace of mind while I listen to my heart. People, you can never change the way they feel. Better let them do just what they will, for they will. If you let them steal off your heart. And people, will always make a lover feel a fool. But you knew I loved you. We could have shown them all. But remember this, every other kiss that you'll ever give. Long as we both live. When you need the hand of another man. One you really can surrender with. I will wait for you, like I always do. But something there that can't compare with any other. You are far, when I could have been your star. You listened to people, who scared you to death. And from my heart. Strange that I was wrong enough to think you'd love me too. I guess you were kissing a fool. You must have been kissing a foolIM NIN'ALU. DAL THAE NA DI VIM. DAL THAE MA ROM. LO NIN'ALU. JA JA JA JA. I'M NIN'ALU LU LU. I'M NIN'ALU LU LU. EL HI. EL HI. I'M NIN'ALU LU LU. I'M NIN'ALU LU LU.

Riding in the back, oozing down the street. Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight. Spending all my money on a Saturday night. Honey, I just wonder what you do there in the back of your Pink Cadillac. Pink Cadillac. Well now way back in the bible. Temptations always come along. There's always somebody tempting you. Into doing something they know is wrong. Well they tempt you man with silver. And they tempt you sir with gold. And they tempt you with the pleasures. That flesh does surely hold. They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple. Man I ain't going for that. I know it was her Pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats. Riding in the back, oozing down the street. Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight. Spending all my money on a Saturday night. Honey, I just wonder what you're doin' in the back of your Pink Cadillac. Pink Cadillac, yeah hey. Now some folks say it's too big. And uses too much gas. Some folks say that it's too old. And that it just goes too fast. Ah but love is bigger than a Honda. And it's bigger than a Subaru. Hey man there's only one thing. And one car that will do. Anyway we don't have to drive it. Honey, we can park it out in back. And have a party in your pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats. Riding in the back, oozing down the street. Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight. Spending all my money on a Saturday night. Honey, I just wonder what you do there in the back of your Pink Cadillac. You know the one I mean, Le Car. Cadillac in the dark, can't do that. When we park in the back of your Pink Cadillac. I like what you do when you do what you do in your Pink. Pretty, pretty, pretty Pink Cadillac. In the dark, can't do that. In the back of your Pink CadillacAll that I have is all that you've given me. Did you ever worry that I'd come to depend on you. I gave you all the love I had in me. Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true. Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street. And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on. You talk of love but you don't know how it feels. When you realise that you're not the only one. Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart. You'd better stop before you go and break my heart. Ooh you'd better stop. Time after time I've tried to walk away. But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two. So I just resign myself to it every day. Now all I can do is to leave it up to you. Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart. You'd better stop before you go and break my heart. Ooh you'd better stop. Stop if love me. (you will remember). Now's the time to be sorry. (that day forever). I won't believe that you'd walk out on me. Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart.

Like we were before. . Now I'm back to what I knew before you. Somehow the city doesn't look the same. I'd give my life for one more night. Having you here to hold me tight, oh, please. Take me there again. Woh, woh. . And I remember how you loved me. Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye. But I remember every moment of those endless summer nights. . I still recall the walks along the beaches. The way your hair would glisten in the sun. Rising in the afternoon. Making love to you under the moon. Woh, woh, woh. . You remember all the nights we spent in silence. Every single breath you took was mine. We can have it all again. Say that you'll be with me when the sun. Brings your heart to mine.

Seems like yesterday. I was only foolin' 'round but she stole my heart away. I've never been the same. I felt the strangest feeling like a raging fire it burned. She left I cried for weeks and. I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned. Love changes, changes everything. Love makes you fly it can break your wings. Love changes, changes everything. Love makes the rules from fools to kings. Love changes. Then the years went rollin' by. I grew up and moved away. Had to earn my pay. Found another lover then. But my heart is sad to say. It only ended up the same way. And I wondered was I destined to spend my life alone. Oh girl you answered my question. This time it's working you've given me new hope. Love changes, changes everything. Love makes you fly it can break your wings. Love changes, changes everything. Love makes the rules from fools to kings. Love changes, love changes everything.

Baby, baby, babySome dreams are in the night time. And some seem like yesterday. But leaves turn brown and fade. Ships sail away. You long to say a thousand words. But seasons change. It feels like it's forever. No reason for emptiness. But time just runs away. No more day by day. You dream again it seems in vain. When seasons change. I want you. I want to feel you by my side. I need you. Don't you know I need you, baby?. Seasons change, feelings change. It's been so long since I found you. Yet it seems like yesterday. Seasons change, people change. I'll sacrifice tomorrow. Just to have you here today. Forever seems so far away. There's time for love and for play. You dream about today. Feeling slips away. The winds that blow they go away.

Time, time, time. See what's become of me. While I looked around. For my possibilities. I was so hard to please. Look around. Leaves are brown. And the sky. Is a hazy shade of winter. Hear the salvation army band. Down by the riverside. It's bound to be a better ride. Than what you've got planned. Carry a cup in your hand. Look around. Leaves are brown. And the sky. Is a hazy shade of winter. Hang on to your hopes my friend. That's an easy thing to say. But if your hopes should pass away. Simply pretend. That you can build them again. Look around. Grass is high. Fields are ripe. It's the springtime of my life. Seasons change with the scenery. Weaving time in a tapestry. Won't you stop and remember me. Look around. Leaves are brown. And the sky. It's a hazy shade of winter. Look around. Leaves are brown. There's a patch of snow on the groundGirl,. The only thing that matters in my life. Is that I'm down for you and treat you right. You've got no cause to treat me cold as ice. Ohhhh, girl. As long as I've been giving my love to you. You should be giving me your love too. But you just keep on actin' just like a fool.

Um momento que fica no ar. I, I, I. Dancando LambadaI knew it from the start. you would break my heart. but you still i had to play this painful part. you rapped me 'round your itty bitty finger. with your magic smile. you kept me hangin' on a lovers cross a while. you put your spell on me. took my breath away. but there was nothin' i could do to make you stay. i'm gonna miss you. all the love i feel for you. nothing could make me change my point of view. oh girl. i'm gonna miss you baby.

Come beating on your door. I know that I'm a prisoner. To all my Father held so dear. I know that I'm a hostage. To all his hopes and fears. I just wish I could have told him in the living years. Crumpled bits of paper. Filled with imperfect thoughts. Stilted conversations. I'm afraid that's all we've got. You say you just don't see it. He says it's perfect sense. You just can't get agreement. In this present tense. We all talk a different language. Talkin' in defense. Say it loud, say it clear. You can listen as well as you hear. It's too late when we die. To admit we don't see eye to eye. So we open up a quarrel. Between the present and the past. We only sacrifice the future. It's the bitterness that lasts. So Don't yield to the fortunes. You sometimes see as fate. It may have a new perspective. On a different date. And if you don't give up, and don't give in. You may just be O.K.. Say it loud, say it clear. You can listen as well as you hear. It's too late when we die. To admit we don't see eye to eye. I wasn't there that morning. When my Father passed away. I didn't get to tell him. All the things I had to say. I think I caught his spirit. Later that same year. I'm sure I heard his echo. In my baby's new born tears. I just wish I could have told him in the living years. Say it loud, say it clear. You can listen as well as you hear. It's too late when we die. To admit we don't see eye to eye. Say it loud, say it clear. Say it loud. Don't give up. Don't give inCome on girls. Do you believe in love?. 'Cause I got something to say about it. And it goes something like this. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test. You know, you know, you've got to. Make him express how he feels. And maybe then you'll know your love is real. You don't need diamond rings. Or eighteen karat gold. Fancy cars that go very fast. You know they never last, no, no. What you need is a big strong hand. To lift you to your higher ground. Make you feel like a queen on a throne. Make him love you till you can't come down. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test. You know, you know, you've got to. Make him express how he feels. And maybe then you'll know your love is real. Long stem roses are the way to your heart. But he needs to start with your head. Satin sheets are very romantic. What happens when you're not in bed. You deserve the best in life. So if the time isn't right then move on. Second best is never enough. You'll do much better baby on your own. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test. You know, you know, you've got to. Make him express how he feels. And maybe then you'll know your love is real. Express yourself. You've got to make him. Express himself. Hey, hey, hey, hey. So if you want it right now. Make him show you how. Express what he's got. Oh, baby ready or not. And when you're gone he might regret it. Think about the love he once had. Try to carry on but he just won't get it. He'll be back on his knees. To express himself. You've got to make him. Express himself. Hey, hey. Don't go for second best baby. Put your love to the test. You know, you know, you've got to. Make him express how he feels. And maybe then you'll know your love is real. Express yourself. You've got to make him. Express himself. Hey, hey, hey, hey. So if you want it right now. Make him show you how. Express what he's got. Baby ready or not. Express yourself. Respect yourself. Hey, hey. (So if you want it right now). (Then make him show you how). Express what he's got. Oh, baby ready or not. Express yourselfIf You Don't Know Me By Now. You will never never never know me. All the things. That we've been through. You should understand me. Like I understand you. Now girl I know the difference. Between right and wrong. I ain't gonna do nothing. To break up our happy home. Don't get so excited. When I come home. A little late at night. Cos we only act like children. When we argue fuss and fight. If you don't know me by now. You will never never never know me. We've all got our. Own funny moods. I've got mine. Woman you've got yours too. Just trust in me like I trust in you. As long as we've been together. It should be so easy to do. Just get yourself together.

A beautiful face without a name for so long. A beautiful smile to hide the pain. Did you ever know that you're my hero. And everything I would like to be?. I can fly higher than an eagle.

'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings. Oh, the wind beneath my wings. You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings. Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high. Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings. Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings. Fly, fly, so high against the sky. So high I almost touch the sky. Thank you, thank you. Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wingsWho's that gigolo on the street. With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet. Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed?.

So you say, you wanted money. But you know it's never funny. When your shoes worn through. And there's a rumble in your tummy. But you had to have style, get a gold tooth smile. Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile. Committed a crime and went inside. It was coming your way but you had to survive. When you lost your babe, you lost the race.

Sowing The SeedsThe one good thing in my life. Has gone away, I don't want to know why. She's gone away I don't know where. Somewhere I can't follow her. The one good thing didn't stay too long. My back was turned and she was gone. Good thing where have you gone?. My good thing you've been gone too long. People say I should forget. There's plenty more don't get upset. People say she's doin' fine. Mutual friends I see sometime. That's not what I want to hear. I want to hear she wants me near. Good thing where have you gone?. My good thing you've been gone too long?. Then one day she came back. I was so happy that I didn't ask. Morning came into my room. Caught me dreaming like a fool. Good thing, good thing.

And the tears are in my eyes. Look away, baby, look away. And if we meet on the streets someday. And I don't know what to say. Look away, baby, look away. Don't look at me. I don't want you to see me this way. When we both agreed as lovers. We were better off as friends. That's how it had to be. Yeah, that's how it had to be. I tell you I'm fine. But sometimes I just pretend. Wish you were holding me. Wish you were still holding me. I just never thought that I would be replaced so soon. I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you. I know I wanted to be free. Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be. But if you see me walking by. And the tears are in my eyes. Look away, baby, look away. And if we meet on the streets someday. And I don't know what to say. Look away, baby, look away. Don't look at me. I don't want you to see me this way. If you see me walking by. And the tears are in my eyes. Look away, baby, look away. And if we meet on the streets someday. And I don't know what to say. Look away, baby, look away. Don't look at me. I don't want you to see me this way. If you see me walking by. And the tears are in my eyes. Look away, baby, look away. Don't look at me. I don't want you to see me this way. When you called me up this morning. Told me 'bout the new love you found.

But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope,. So don’t hang yourself with a celibate rope.. New movie’s showin’, so you’re goin’. Could care less about the five you’re blowin’. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. Then you spot a fine woman sittin’ in your row. She’s dressed in yellow, she says “Hello,. Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!”.

If you want it, baby, you got it.. In the city, ladies look pretty.. Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty.. Tell a funny joke just to get some play,. Then you try to make a move and she says, “no way.”. Girls are fakin’, goodness sakin’,. They want a man who brings home the bacon.. Got no money and you got no car,. Then you got no woman and there you are.. Some girls are sophistic, materialistic,. Looking for a man makes them opportunistic.. They’re lyin’ on the beach perpetratin’ a tan. So that a brother with money can be their man.. So on the beach you’re strollin’, real high-rollin’,. Everything you have is yours and not stolen.. A girl runs up with somethin’ to prove,.

Although we both lie close together. We feel miles apart, inside. Was it somethin' I said or something I did. Did my words not come out right??. Tho' I tried not to hurt you. Tho' I tried. But I guess that's why they say. Every rose has its thorn. Just like every night has its dawn. Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song. Every rose has its thorn. Yea it does. I listen to our favorite song playin' on the radio. Hear the dj say love's a game of. Easy come and easy go. But I wonder does he know. Has he ever felt like this. And I know that you'd be here right now. If I could have let you know somehow I guess. Every rose has its thorn. Just like every night has its dawn. Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song. Every rose has its thorn. Though it's been a while now. I can still feel so much pain. Like the knife that cuts you the wound heals. But the scar, that scar remains.. I know I could have saved our love that night. If I'd know what to say. Instead of making love. We both made our separate ways. Now I hear you've found somebody new. And that I never meant that much to you. To hear that tears me up inside. And to see you cuts me like a knife, i guess. Every rose has its thorn. Just like every night has its dawn. Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song. Every rose has its thornSo when you really love me. Darling bring me Edelweiss. So when you really love me. You should bring me Edelweiss. Freibier!

Cold coolin' at a bar, and I'm lookin' for some action. But like Mike Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction. The girls are all around, but none of them wanna get with me. My threads are fresh and I'm lookin' def, yo, what's up with L O C?. The girls is all jockin' at the other end of the bar. Havin' drinks with some no name chump. When they know that I'm the star. So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina. I asked the guy, "Why you so fly?" he said, "Funky Cold Medina". Funky Cold Medina. This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks. Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick. It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac. A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap. So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg. Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me. And did the wild thing on my leg. He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner. But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina. You know what I'm sayin'?. I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin' down my door. I got Spuds McKenzie. Alex from Stroh's. They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal. I went up to this girl, she said, "Hi, my name is Sheena". I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina. She said, "I'd like a drink," I said, "Ehm okay, I'll go get it". Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips. And I knew that she was with it. So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned. But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man. So I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener. You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina. You know, ain't no plans with a man. This is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies. Ya know?. Break it down. Back in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection. I took a shot as a contestant on, The Love Connection. The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner. I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner. She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'. Instead she started talkin' 'bout plans for our weddin'. I said, "Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya". That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina. Ya, know what I'm sayin'. That Medina's a monster, y'all. Funky Cold MedinaI said I would get over you. Now I'm here out on my own. Trying to live my life. And now you wanna come back. But I don't need no brand new lies, listen up.

He must have had a plan. 'Cause you were born to be my baby. And I was made to be your man. Light a candle, blow the world away. Table for two on a TV tray. Nothin' ain't fancy, but that's okay. Our time, our way. Hold me close baby, hang on tight. Buckle your seats for a bumpy ride. We're two kids hitching this road of life. Our world, our fights. Stand by my side. There's a chance we'll get by. And I'll know that you'll be live. In my heart till the day that I die. You were born to be my baby. And I was made to be your man. We got something to believe in. Even if we don't know where we stand. Only God knows the reason. Oh, He must have had a plan. 'Cause you were born to be my baby. I was made to be your man. My heart beats like a drum. Flesh to flesh, one on one. And I'll never let go. Something I know deep inside. You were born to be my baby. I was made to be your man. We've got something to believe in. Even if we don't know where we stand. Only God knows the reason. Oh, He must have had a plan. 'Cause you were born to be my baby. And I was made to be your manWorkin' like a dog for the boss man. Workin' for the company. I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin'. I'm gonna have a fantasy. But where am I gonna look?. They tell me that love is blind. I really need a girl like an open book. To read between the lines. Love in an elevator. Livin' it up when I'm goin' down. Love in an elevator. Lovin' it up till I hit the ground. Jacki's in the elevator. Lingerie second floor. She said 'can I see you later. And love you just a little more?'. I kinda hope we get stuck. Nobody gets out alive. She said I'll show ya how to fax in the mail room. Honey and have you home by five. Love in an elevator. Livin' it up when I'm goin' down. Love in an elevator. Lovin' it up till I hit the ground. In the air, in the air, honey one more time not, it ain't fair. Love in an elevator. Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down. Love in an. Elevator. Goin' down. Gonna be a penthouse pauper. Gonna be a millionaire. I'm gonna be a real fast talker. And have me a love affair. Gotta get my timin' right. It's a test that I gotta pass. I'll chase you all the way to the stairway honey. Kiss your sassafras. Do you care? Do you care?. Honey one more time now it ain't fair. Love in an elevator. Livin' it up when I'm goin' downRemember when the days were long. And rolled beneath a deep blue sky?. Didn't have a care in the world. With mommy and daddy standing by. When happily ever after fails. And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales. The lawyers dwell on small details. Since daddy had to fly. Aah, but I know a place where we can go. That's still untouched by men. We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by. And the tall grass waves in the wind. And you can lay your head back on the ground. And let your hair fall all around me. Offer up your best defense but this is the end. This is the end of the innocence. Oh, beautiful for spacious skies. But now those skies are threatening. They're beating plowshares into swords. For this tired old man that we elected king. Armchair warriors often fail. And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales. The lawyers clean up all details. Since daddy had to lie. Aah, but I know a place where we can go. And wash away this sin. We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by. And the tall grass waves in the wind. Just lay your head back on the ground. And let your hair spill all around me. Offer up your best defense but this is the end. This is the end of the innocence. Who knows how long this will last. Now we've come so far, so fast. But somewhere back there in the dust. That same small town in each of us. I need to remember this. So baby, give me just one kiss. And let me take a long last look. Before we say goodbye. Just lay your head back on the ground. And let your hair fall all around me. Offer up your best defense, this is the end. This is the end of the innocenceOn candy stripe legs the spider man comes. Softly through the shadow of the evening sun. Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead. Looking for the victim shivering in bed. Searching out fear in the gathering gloom. And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room. And there is nothing I can do, when I realize with fright. That the spider man is having me for dinner tonight. Quietly he laughs and shaking his head. Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed. And softer than shadow and quicker than flies. His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes. "Be still, be calm, be quiet now my precious boy. Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more. For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light. The spider man is having you for dinner tonight". And I feel like I'm being eaten. By a thousand million shivering furry holes. And I know that in the morning. I will wake up in the shivering cold. And the spider man is always hungry. Come into my parlor, said the spider to the fly. I have somethingWhat would I have to do. To get you to notice me too. Do I. Stand in line. One of a million. Admiring eyes. Walk a tightrope way up high. Write your name across the sky. I'm going crazy just to let you know. You'd be amazed how much I love you so baby. When I get my hands on you I won't let go. This time I know it's for real. Should I write or call your home. Shout it out with a megaphone. Radio, TV news. Got to find a way. To get my message to you. To say I love you with a neon sign. Anything to make you mine. I'm going crazy just to let you know. If I wait too long for you I might explode baby. I've been around the block enough to know. That this time I know it's for real. Oh baby. This time, this time, this time, this time. Oh baby. This time, this time. Walk a tightrope way up high. Write your name across the sky. I'm going crazy just to let you know. You'd be amazed how much I love you so baby. When I get my hands on you I won't let go. This time I know it's for real.

I said I can't let you go. It's not emotional feeling. I need your body and soul. You give me one good reason to leave me. I'll give you ten good reasons to stay. You're the only one I believe in. I'll be hurt, I'll be hurt if you walked away. Too many broken hearts in the world. There's too many, dreams can be broken in two. Too many broken hearts in the world. So I won't give up the fight for you. The world is full of lonely people. Never have and to love. Last night I tried to reach you. But somehow it wasn't enough. So was it, can't you wait any longer?. I'll give you all a lover should give. It ain't my pride but my love that is stronger. I'll be hurt, I'll be hurt if you walked away. Too many broken hearts in the world. There's too many, dreams can be broken in two. Too many broken hearts in the world. So I won't give up the fight for you. Too many broken hearts in the world. There's too many, dreams can be broken in two. Too many broken hearts in the world. So I won't give up the fight for you. You give me one good reason to leave me. I'll give you ten good reasons to stay. You're the only one I believe in. I'll be hurt, I'll be hurt if you walked away. Too many broken hearts in the world. There's too many, dreams can be broken in two. Too many broken hearts in the world. So I won't give up the fight for you. Too many broken hearts in the world. There's too many, dreams can be broken in two. Too many broken hearts in the world. So I won't give up the fight for you. Too many broken hearts in the world. There's too many, dreams can be broken in two. Too many broken hearts in the world. So I won't give up the fight for you. ...LIL' ROMEO. Miscellaneous. Take My Pain Away"(feat. Lil' Zane. [Lil' Romeo]. Let's Conquer, Big Daddy, Kevin Miller, Grandma Miller and Grandma Elizabeth. [Lil' Romeo - Repeat 3x]. To My Loves I gone, I gotta know. Where do we go from here, I gotta know. [Lil' Romeo]. Dear God, I remember when times was hard. Gunshots echoed the block like passin' cars. I miss my cousin Lance look out for him. I love him, he died so young you musta had a place for him. My Uncle Kevin, the family miss him. He in Heaven, I ain't really understand 'till I turned seven. Every year that go by. I try to understand why (I understand why). Everytime someone born, somebody gotta die. It's sad, I hate to see my mama cry. It's okay, come here mom and wipe your eyes. It's hard ta focus, kids playin' in school thinkin' they soldiers. Teachers can't teach now they nervous. Sittin' there thinkin' ta myself what we do to deserve this. Seein' kids die for no purpose (I don't know). Sittun' there thinkin' ta myself what we do to deserve this. Seein' kids die for no purpose. [Chorus: Repeat 4x]. (Take my pain away). To my love ones gone, I gotta know. Where do we go from here, I gotta know. (Take my pain away). [Lil' Zane]. The fast life is much too short, that's what we all thought. In and out of courts for assualts of all sorts. Seein' you go had me feelin' low. Just ta know a brotha was about to blow. But the world was killin' him slow. Your fans miss you wit a passion. And they wonder are you still alive and still laughin'. I still stress over your death. Caught four in to your chest. Lay your rest to the west. May your soul be blessed. And Lord knows how we miss you. Murder is a big issue. Can't stop the blood wit tissue. When the slugs hit you. All your family and friends shed tears. Cause for years. We knew you would make it, it was clear. Toast to both coasts. We need to stand close. Cause it ain't no silence when God is right in front of your eyes. Awakin' the time to shine. In time you'll find. I roll a dutch. Cause the worlds to much, to take my pain away. [Chorus: Repeat 4x]. [Lil' Romeo]. I shed tears for da world.Death carries no age limit.. To my love ones up there pray for me,. Life is prevailant. Oh yeah Lance picture this boy.. I'm rappin' and ballin' ya heard.. R.I.P to my peeps. I miss y'all, I miss y'all.. [Chorus]Aaow!-hoo hoo!.

Your girlfriend is on another date with the hero in your dream. Turn around, ask yourself. So, you think you're gonna win this time Manchild?. Is it the pain of the drinking. Or the Sunday sinking feeling. The car never seems to work. When it's late your girlfriend's on a date. And the hero with her in your dream. In your sleep it seemed to like you. Turn around and ask yourself. Turn around ask yourself. Manchild, will you ever win?. Manchild, look at the state you're in. Could you go undercover. And sell your brand new lover. Could you be someone else for a night?. Maybe someone else will love you. You sell your soul for a tacky song. Like the one you hear on the radio. Turn around ask yourself. Turn around and ask yourself. Manchild, will you ever win. Manchild, look at the state you're in. Manchild, he will make you cry. Manchild, Manchild, Manchild. From Monday down to Friday. You're working on another man's car. Or is it in the factory?. It doesn't matter where you are. Just turn around and ask yourself is this communication. Accentuate the positive and give some illustration. See Manchild, you're no one, you turn the microphone on. Control communication when I'm kickin' it and so on. To the point that I need, the air that I breathe. Into an audience that's waiting and ecstatic to receive. For the meantime another mean rhyme, I keep on sayin' it. I know what the time is the crowd will keep playing it. Through the speaker boxes loud's my diagnosis. 'Cause I believe in miracles and words in heavy doses. Enough R E S P E and C T. Respect yourself express no stress the mike is easy. Just believe that all you need is the air that you breathe. Turn around ask yourself. Manchild, will you ever win?. Manchild, look at the state you're in. Manchild, he will make you cry. Manchild, Manchild, Manchild. He's the apple of your eye. Once bitten twice shy, why don't you bite me again. Just take it in the right and go tell your friend. Are you ready for the words I turn the microphone on. A figure of speech to reach you at the back and so on. The style I'm stimulating dance floors. Raise your body temperature now and. This demands for power in the amp you know lauds my diagnosis. 'Cause I believe in miracles and words in heavy dosesHit it now. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Tell me mirror what is wrong?. Can it be my De La clothes. Or is it just my De La song?. What I do ain't make-believe. People say I sit and try. When it comes to being De La. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. Now you tease my Plug One style. And my Plug One spectacles. You say Plug One and Two are hippies. No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull. Always pushing that we've formed an image. There's no need to lie. When it comes to being Plug One. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. Proud, I'm proud of what I am. Poems I speak are Plug Two type. Please, oh, please let Plug Two be. Himself not what you read or write. Right is wrong when hype is written. On the Soul, De La that is. Style is surely our own thing. Not the false disguise of showbiz. De La Soul is from the soul. And this fact I can't deny. Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie. And from me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. Glory, glory Hallelu. Glory for Plugs One and Two. But that glory's been denied. By kizids and dookie eyes. People think they dis my person. By stating I'm darkly pack. I know this so I point at Q Tip. And he states, "Black is black". Mirror, mirror on the wall. Shovel chestnuts in my path. Please keep on up with the nuts. So I don't get in aftermath. But if I do I'll calmly punch them. In the fourth day of July. 'Cause they tried to mess with. Third degree, that's me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and I. It's just me myself and IYou say you want diamonds on a ring of gold. You say you want your story to remain untold. But all the promises we make from the cradle to the grave. When all I want is you. You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it. Treasure just to look upon it all the riches in the night. You say you'll give me eyes in a moon of blindness. A river in a time of dryness, a harbour in the tempest. But all the promises we make from the cradle to the grave. When all I want is you. You say you want your love to work out right. To last with me through the night. You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold. Your story to remain untold, your love not to grow cold. All the promises we break from the cradle to the grave. When all I want is you. You. All I want is you. All I want is you. All I want is youIf you're ready, I'm willing and able. Gonna lay my cards out on the table. 'Cause you're mine, I'm yours for the taking. Right now the rules we made are meant for breaking. . What you get ain't always what you see.

I've been livin' in style, unaccustomed as I am to the luxury life. I've been hittin' the town and it didn't hit back. I've been doin' the rounds, unaccustomed as I am to the time on my hands. Now, I don't have to tell anybody when I'm gonna get back. Ever since you went away, I've had this sentimental. Inclination not to change a single thing. As I pull the sheets back on the bed. I want to go bury my head in your pillow. Now that I'm alone again, I can't stop breakin' down again. The simplest things set me off again and take me to that place. Where I can't find my brave face, where I can't find my brave face. My brave, my brave, my brave face, my brave face. I've been livin' a lie, unaccustomed as I am to the work of a housewife. I've been breakin' up, dirty dishes and they throwin' them away. Ever since you left I have been tryin' to compose. A, baby will you please come home, note meant for you. As I clear away another untouched TV dinner. From the table, I laid for two. Now that I'm alone again, I can't stop breakin' down again. The simplest things set me off again, take me to that place. Where I can't find my brave face, where I can't find my brave face. My brave, my brave, my brave face, my brave faceZappin' it to you, the pressure's everywhere. Goin' right through you.
