But every time you come too close I move away. I wanna believe in everything that you say. 'Cause it sounds so good. But if you really want me move slow. There's things about me you just have to know. Sometimes I run. Sometimes I hide. Sometimes I'm scared of you. But all I really want is to hold you tight. Treat you right, be with you day and night. Baby, all I need is time. I don't wanna be so shy. Every time that I'm alone I wonder why. Hope that you will wait for me. You'll see that you're the only one for me. I wanna believe in everything that you say. 'Cause it sounds so good. But if you really want me move slow. There's things about me you just have to know. Sometimes I run (sometimes). Sometimes I hide. Sometimes I'm scared of you. But all I really want is to hold you tight. Treat you right, be with you day and night. All I really want is to hold you tight. Treat you right, be with you day and night. Baby all I need is time. Just hang around and you'll see. There's nowhere I'd rather be. If you love me, trust in me. The way that I trust in you.

And your heart beats like a subway train. Ooh it makes you wanna die. Ooh, don't you wanna take her?. Wanna make her all your own?. Maria, you've gotta see her. Go insane and out of your mind. Latina, Ave Maria. A million and one candle lights. I've seen this thing before. In my best friend and the boy next door. Fool for love and full of fire. Won't come in from the rain. She's oceans running down the drain. Blue as ice and desire. Don't you wanna make her?. Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?. Maria, you've gotta see her. Go insane and out of your mind. Latina, Ave Maria. A million and one candle lights. Ooh, don't you wanna break her?. Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?. She walks like she don't care. Walkin' on imported air. Ooh, it makes you wanna die. Maria, you've gotta see her. Go insane and out of your mind. Latina, Ave Maria. A million and one candle lights. Maria, you've gotta see her. Go insane and out of your mind. Latina, Ave Maria. A million and one candle lightsCome on, come on. I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself. Is life worth living, should I blast myself?. I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black. My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch. Cops give a damn about a negro. Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero. Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares. One less hungry mouth on the welfare. First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers. Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other. It's time to fight back that's what Huey said. Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead. I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere. Unless we share with each other. We gotta start makin' changes. Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers. And that's how it's supposed to be. How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?. I'd love to go back to when we played as kids. But things changed, that's the way it is. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. I see no changes, all I see is racist faces. Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races. We under, I wonder what it takes to make this. One better place, let's erase the wasted. Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right. 'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight. And only time we chill is when we kill each other. It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other. And although it seems heaven sent. We ain't ready, to see a black President. It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact. The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks. But some things will never change. Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game. Now tell me, what's a mother to do?. Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you. You gotta operate the easy way. I made a G today, but you made it in a sleazy way. Sellin' crack to the kid, I gotta get paid. Well hey, well, that's the way it is. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. Come on, come on, that's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. We gotta make a change. It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes. Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live. And let's change the way we treat each other. You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do. What we gotta do, to survivem. And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?. There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East. Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs. So the police can bother me. And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do. But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you. Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up. Crack you up and pimps smack you up. You gotta learn to hold ya own. They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone. But tell the cops, they can't touch this. I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this. That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool?. My mama didn't raise no fool. And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped. And I never get to lay back. 'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs. Some buck that I roughed up way back. Comin' back after all these years. Rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, that's the way it is. That's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. That's just the way it is. Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is. Aww, yeah. Some things will never changeHow did I ever let you slip away?. Never knowing, I'd be singing this song some day. And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more. Ever since you closed the door. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then my darlin', you'd still be mine. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine. Funny, funny how time goes by. And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye. Oh why, oh why should one have to go on suffering?. When every day I pray, please come back to me. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then my darlin' you, you'd be mine. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then my darlin', you still be mine. And you had enough love for the both of us. But I, I, I did you wrong I admit I did. But now, I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then my darlin' you, you'd be mine, whao. If I could turn, turn back the hands of time. Then my darlin', you still be mine. Oh, I'd never hurt you.   (If I could turn back). Never do you wrong.   (If I could turn back). And never leave your side.   (If I could turn back the hands). Turn back the hands. There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you.   (If I could turn back). Forever honest and true to you.   (If I could turn back). If you accept me back in your heart, I love you.   (If I could turn back the hands).   (If I could turn back). That would be my will.   (If I could turn back). Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands.   (If I could turn back the hands). I'm going down, yes I am.   (If I could turn back). Down on my bended knee, yeah.   (If I could turn back). And I'm gonna be right there, until you return to me.   (If I could turn back the hands).   (If I could turn back). Just turn back that little clock on the wall.   (If I could turn back). Then I'd come to realize how much, I love you.   (If I could turn back the hands).   (If I could turn back). Love you.   (If I could turn back). Love you.   (If I could turn back the hands). Love you. Love you.   (If I could turn back). (If I could turn back). (If I could turn back the hands)Have you ever loved somebody so much. It makes you cry. Have you ever needed something so bad.

Have you ever loved somebody so much. It makes you cry(makes you wanna breakdown and cry). Have you ever needed something so bad. You can't sleep at night. Have you ever tried to find the words. But they don't come out right. Have you ever, have you ever. What do I gotta do to get you in my arms baby. What do I gotta say to get to your heart. To make you understand how I need you next to me. Gotta get you in my world. 'Cuz baby I can't sleep. Have you ever loved somebody so much. It makes you cry. Have you ever needed something so bad. You can't sleep at night. Have you ever tried to find the words. But they don't come out right. Have you ever, have you everSomebody once told me. The world is gonna roll me. I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was looking kinda dumb. With her finger and her thumb. In shape of an "L" on her forehead. Well the years start coming. And they don't stop coming. Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running. Didn't make sense. Not to live for fun. Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb. So much to do. So much to see. So what's wrong with taking the back street. You'll never know if you don't go. You'll never shine if you don't glow. Hey now. You're an all star. Get your game on. Go play. Hey now. You're a rock Star. Get the show on. Get paid. And all that glitters is gold. Only shooting stars break the mold. It's a cool place. And they say it gets colder. You're bundled up now. Wait 'til you get older. But the media men. Beg to differ. Judging by the hole in the satellite picture. The ice we skate. Is getting pretty thin. The waters getting warm. So you might as well swim. My world's on fire. How about yours. That's the way I like it and I never get bored. Hey now. You're an all star. Get your game on. Go play. Hey now. You're a rock star. Get the show on. Get paid. And all that glitters is gold. Only shooting stars break the mold. Hey now. You're an all star. Get your game on. Go play. Hey now. You're a rock star. Get the show on. Get paid. And all that glitters is gold. Only shooting stars. Somebody once asked. Could you spare some change for gas. I need to get myself away from this place. I said yep. What a concept. I could use. A little fuel myself.

The Lord took her away from me. She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good. So I can see my baby when I leave this world. When I woke up the rain was pourin' down. There were people standin' all around. Something warm flowing through my eyes. But somehow I found my baby that night. I lifted her head, she looked at me and said. "Hold me darling, just a little while". I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss. I found the love that I knew I had missed. Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight. I lost my love, my life, that night. Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?. The Lord took her away from me. She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good.

Now if six of ya'll went out. Then four of you were really cheap.. Cause only two of you had dinner. I found your credit card receipt.. Hook It's not right, but it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.. Pack your bags up and leave.. And don't you dare come. Running back to me.. It's not right, but it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway. Close the door behind you. Leave your key. I'd rather be alone than unhappy. Verse 2. I'm packing bags so you can leave town for a week. The phone rings then you look at me (why'd you turn and look at me). You said it was one of your friends from over 54th street. So why did 213 show up on your caller ID.. I've been through all this before. So how could you think.. That I would stand around. And take some more. Things are gonna change.. Cause I won't be a fool anymore. That's why you have to leave.. So don't turn around to see my face. Cause there's no more tears. Left here for you to see.. Verse 3. Now is it really worth you going out like that. See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back. See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for me. It turns out, you were making a fool of me.. Hook(repeat out)Like a movie scene. in the sweetest dreams. I have pictured us together. Now to feel your lips. on my fingertips, have to say is even better.. Then I never thought it could possibly be. It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free. From all of my sadness. the tears that I've cried. I have spent all of my life.... Waiting for tonight, oh. When you would be here in my arms.. Waiting for tonight, oh. I've dreamed of this love for so long.. Waiting for tonight.. Tender words you say, take my breath away. Love me now and leave me never.. Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace. I want to stay in this forever.. I think of the days when the sun used to set. On my empty heart, all alone in my bed. Tossing and turning, emotions were strong. I knew I had to hold on.... Waiting for tonight, oh. When you would be here in my arms.. Waiting for tonight, oh. I've dreamed of this love for so long.. Waiting for tonight, oh. When you would be here in my arms.. Waiting for tonight, oh. I've dreamed of this love for so long.. Waiting for tonight.. Gone are the days when the sun used to set. On my empty heart all alone in my bed..

Waiting for tonight.It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart. Without saying a word, you can light up the dark. Try as I may I can never explain. What I hear when you don't say a thing. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall. You say it best, when you say nothing at all. All day long I can hear people talking out loud. But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd. Try as they may they could never define. What's been said between your heart and mine. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall. You say it best when you say noting at all. The smile on your face lets me know that you need me. There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me. The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall. You say it best, when you say nothing at all. (You say it best when you say nothing at all. You say it best when you say nothing at all.). That smile on your face. The truth in your eyes. The touch of your hand. Let's me know that you need me. (You say it best when you say nothing at all. You say it best when you say nothing at all.)They say around the way you've asked for me. There's even talk about you wanting me. I must admit that's what I want to hear. But that's just talk until you take me there, oh. . If it's true don't leave me all alone out here. Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there. Tell me what you're feeling 'cause I need to know. Girl you've gotta let me know which way to go. . 'Cause I need to know, I need to know. Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know. I need to know, I need to know. Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know. . My every thought is of this being true. It's getting harder not to think of you. Girl I'm exactly where I wanna be. The only things I need you here with me, oh. . If it's true don't leave me all alone out here. Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there. Tell me what you're feeling 'cause I need to know.

Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to knowSpend all your time waiting. For that second chance. For a break that would make it okay. There's always some reason. To feel not good enough. And it's hard at the end of the day. I need some distraction. Oh beautiful release. Memories seep from my veins. Let me be empty. Oh and weightless and maybe. I'll find some peace tonight. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you fear. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort here. So tired of the straight line. And everywhere you turn. There's vultures and thieves at your back. The storm keeps on twisting. Keep on building the lies. That you make up for all that you lack. It don't make no difference. Escaping one last time. It's easier to believe. In this sweet madness. Oh this glorious sadness. That brings me to my knees. In the arms of the angel. Fly away from here. From this dark cold hotel room. And the endlessness that you fear. You are pulled from the wreckage. Of your silent reverie. You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort here. You're in the arms of the angel. May you find some comfort hereI wanna know. Who ever told you I was letting go?. The only joy that I have ever known. Girl, they were lying. Just look around. And all of the people that we used to know. Just gave it up, they wanna let it go. But we're still trying. So, you should know this love we shared was never made to die. I'm glad we're on this one way street, just you and I. Just you and I. I'm never gonna say goodbye. 'Cause I never wanna see you cry. I swore to you my love would remain. And I swear it all over again and I. I'm never gonna treat you bad. 'Cause I never wanna see you sad. I swore to share your joy and your pain. And I swear it all over again. All over again. Some people say. That everything has got it's place and time. Even the day must give way to the night. But I'm not buying. 'Cause in your eyes. I see a love that burns internally. And if you see how beautiful you are to me. You know I'm not lying. Shall there be times we wanna say goodbye but even if we try. There are some things in this life won't be denied. Won't be denied. I'm never gonna say goodbye. 'Cause I never wanna see you cry. I swore to you my love would remain. And I swear it all over again and I. I'm never gonna treat you bad. 'Cause I never wanna see you sad. I swore to share your joy and your pain. And I swear it all over again. The more I know of you. Is the more I know I love you. And the more that I'm sure. I want you forever and ever more. And the more that you love me. The more that I know.... That I'm never gonna let you go. Gotta let you know that I (I'm never gonna say goodbye). 'Cause I never wanna see you cry. I swore to you my love would remain. And I swear it all over again and I. I'm never gonna treat you bad. 'Cause I never wanna see you sad. I swore to share your joy and your pain. And I swear it all over again. All over again. All over again. I'd swear it all over againAt first we started out real cool. Taking me places I ain't never been. But now, you're getting comfortable. Ain't doing those things you did no more. You're slowly making me pay for things. Your money should be handling. And now you ask to use my car. Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank. And you have the audacity. To even come and step to me. Ask to hold some money from me. Until you get your check next week. You triflin', good for nothing type of brother. Silly me, why haven't I found another?. A baller, when times get hard, I need someone to help me out. Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about. Can you pay my bills?. Can you pay my telephone bills?. Do you pay my automo' bills?. If you did then maybe we could chill. I don't think you do. So, you and me are through. Can you pay my bills?. Can you pay my telephone bills?. Do you pay my automo' bills?. If you did then maybe we could chill. I don't think you do. So, you and me are through. Now you've been maxing out my card. Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends. Haven't paid the first bill. But instead you're headin' to the mall. Goin' on shopping sprees. Perpetrating to your friends like you be ballin'. And then you use my cell phone. Callin' whoever that you thinks at home. And then when the bill comes. All of a sudden you be acting dumb. Don't know where none of these calls come from. When your mommas number's here more than once. You triflin', good for nothing type of brother. Silly me, why haven't I found another?. A baller, when times get hard, I need someone to help me out. Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about. Can you pay my bills?.

There's nothing you can say or do for me. And I don't want a miracle. You'll never change for no one. And I hear your reasons why. Where did you sleep last night?. And was she worth it,. was she worth it?. I'm strong enough to live without you. Strong enough and I quit crying. Long enough. now I'm strong enough. To know you gotta go. There's no more to say. So save your breath and walk away. No matter what I hear you say. I'm strong enough. to know you gotta go. So you feel misunderstood. Baby have I got news for you. On being used, I could write the book. But you don't wanna hear about it. 'Cause I've been losing sleep. And you've been going cheap. And she ain't worth half of me it's true. I'm telling you, that.

Now I'm strong enough...It's undeniable that we should be together. It's unbelievable how I used to say, â€½That I'd fall neverâ€. The basis is need to know if you don't know just how I feel. Then let me show you now that I'm for real. If all things in time, time will reveal, yeah. One, you're like a dream come true. Two, just wanna be with you. Three, girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me. And four, repeat steps one through three. Five, make you fall in love with me. If ever I believe my work is done then I'll start back at one, yeah. It's so incredible the way things work themselves out. And all emotional once you know what it's all about, hey. And undesirable for us to be apart, never would've made it very far. 'Cause you know you got the keys to my heart. 'Cause. One, you're like a dream come true. Two, just wanna be with you. Three, girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me. And four, repeat steps one through three. Five, make you fall in love with me. If ever I believe my work is done then I'll start back at one. Say farewell to the dark of night, I see the coming of the sun. I feel like a little child whose life has just begun. You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine. You threw out the lifeline just in the nick of time. One, you're like a dream come true. Two, just wanna be with you. Three, girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me. And four, repeat steps one through three. Five, make you fall in love with me. If ever I believe my work is done then I'll start back at oneI was lying on the grass. On Sunday morning of last week. Indulging in my self defeats. My mind was thugged. All laced and bugged. All twisted round and beat. Uncomfortable three feet deep. Now the fuzzy stare from not being there. On a confusing morning week. Impaired my tribal lunar-speak. And of course you can't become. If you only say what you would have done. So I missed a million miles of fun. I know it's up for me. (If you steal my sunshine). Making sure I'm not in too deep. (If you steal my sunshine). Keeping versed and on my feet. (If you steal my sunshine). I was frying on the bench slide. In the park across the street. L A T E R that week. My sticky paws were into making straws. Out of big fat slurpy treats. An incredible eight foot heap. Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tear. In a staring under heat. Involved an under usual feat. And I'm not only among. But I invite who I want to come. So I missed a million miles of fun. I know it's up for me. (If you steal my sunshine). Making sure I'm not in too deep. (If you steal my sunshine). Keeping versed and on my feet. (If you steal my sunshine). I know it's done for me. (If you steal my sunshine). Not something hard to see. (If you steal my sunshine). Keeping dumb and built to beat. (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine. (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine. (If you steal my sunshine). My sunshine. (If you steal my sunshine). ...You know this boogie is for real. I used to put my faith in worship. But then my chance to get to heaven slipped. I used to worry about the future. But then I threw my caution to the wind. I had no reason to be care free, no, no, no.

The way she cared. The love we shared. And through it all. She's always been there. She's all, she's all I ever had. In a world so cold, so empty. She's all, she's all I ever had. It's the way she makes me feel... It's the way she makes me feel. It's the only thing that's real. It's the way she understands. She's my lover, she's my friend. And when I look into her eyes.

What?). My name is Slim Shady. Ahem, excuse me. Can I have the attention of the class. For one second?. Hi kids, do you like violence?. (Yeah, yeah, yeah). Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails. Through each one of my eyelids?. (Uh, huh). Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?. (Yeah, yeah). Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?. (Huh?). My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight. But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate. (Umm). And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead". Uh, uhh, So why's your face red?  Man you wasted. Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else. 'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt. Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off. And smacked her so hard. I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross. I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass. Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast. C'mere slut. (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog). I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off. Hi, my name is, my name is. (What? Who?). My name is Slim Shady. Hi, my name is, my name is. (Huh? What?). My name is Slim Shady. My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high. Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five. I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler. And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers. (Oww). Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up. Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup. Extraterrestrial, runnin' over pedestrians. In a spaceship while they screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends". Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to. I just found out my mom does more dope than I do. (Damn). I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper. Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her. (Oh, thank you). You know you blew up when the women rush your stands. And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans. (Aah). This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph. (Dude, can I get your autograph?). So I signed it "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole". Hi, my name is, my name is. (What? Who?). My name is Slim Shady. Hi, my name is, my name is. (Huh? What?). My name is Slim Shady. Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away. (Get him). Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate. I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die. (Fuck that). I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive. (Huh, yup). Am I comin' or goin'?  I can barely decide. I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?. (Go ahead). All my life I was very deprived. I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide. Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk. (Hachhh-too). I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks. (C'mere). When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits. How you gonna breast feed me, mom?. (Wah). You ain't got no tits. (Wah). I lay awake and strap myself in the bed. Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head. I'm steamin' mad. And by the way when you see my dad?. (Yeah?). Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had. Hi, my name is, my name is. (What? Who?). My name is Slim Shady. Hi, my name is, my name is. (Huh? What?). My name is Slim ShadyWhen I first saw you I already knew. There was something inside of you. Something I thought that I would never find. Angel of mine. I look at you looking at me.

If I could offer you only one tip for the future,. Sunscreen would be it. The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists. whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience…. I will dispense this advice now.... Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. oh nevermind;. you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself. and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before. you and how fabulous you really looked…. You are not as fat as you imagine. Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as. effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that. never crossed your worried mind. the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday. Do one thing everyday that scares you. Sing. Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. don't put up with people who are reckless with yours. Floss. Don't waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind…. the race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself. Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults. if you succeed in doing this, tell me how. Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements. Stretch. Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life…. the most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't. Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone. Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding. anniversary…. what ever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either. your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's. Enjoy your body. use it every way you can…. don't be afraid of it, or what other people think of it. it's the greatest instrument you'll ever own. Dance…even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room. Read the directions, even if you don't follow them. Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly. Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. they are the best link to your past. and the people most likely to stick with you in the future. Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle. because the older you get. the more you need the people you knew when you were young. Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel. Accept certain inalienable truths. prices will rise. politicians will philander. you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young. prices were reasonable. politicians were noble. and children respected their elders. Respect your elders. Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. maybe you have a wealthy spouse. but you never know when either one might run out. Don't mess too much with your hair. or by the time you're 40, it will look 85. Be careful whose advice you buy, but. be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off. painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth. But trust me on the sunscreenShe grew up with the children of the stars. In the Hollywood hills and the Boulevard. Her parents threw big parties everyone was there. They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper. Bob Seeger and Sonny and Cher. And she feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax. And from the stage I can tell that she can't let go and she can't relax. And just before she hangs her head to cry. I sing to her a lullaby. I sing. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Rockabye. She still lives with her Mom outside the city. Down that street about a half a mile. And all her friends tell her. She's so pretty. But she'd be a whole lot prettier. If she smiled once in a while. 'Cause even her smile looks like a frown. And she's seen her share of devils in this angel town. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye, rockabye. I told her I ain't so sure about this place. It's hard to play a gig in this town. Keep a straight face. And seems like everybody's got a plan. It's kind of like Nashville with a tan. Everything's gonna be all right. Rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right. So rockabye, rockabye. Everything's gonna be all right.

See I don't need thatNo, oh, no. Yeah, yeah, oh. You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside. I know it's crazy, but you still can touch my heart. And after all this time you think that I wouldn't feel the same. But time melts into nothing and nothing's changed. I still believe, someday you and me. Will find ourselves in love again. I had a dream, someday you and me. Will find ourselves in love again. Each day of my life, I'm filled with all the joy I could find. You know that I, I'm not the desperate type. If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp, I'd hold it with both hands. It's worth the risk of burning, to have a second chance. No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby. I still believe that we can be together, no, no, no. If we believe that true love never has to end. Then we must know that we will love again. I still believe, someday you and me. Will find ourselves in love again, oh, baby, yeah, yeah. I had a dream you and me. Will find ourselves in love again. I still believe. (Ooh, baby, I do). Someday you and me. (Just give me one more try). In love again. I had a dream. (I miss your love). Someday you and me. Will find ourselves in love again. I still believe, someday you and me. Will find ourselves in love againGood looking, bad tasting. Full bodied, butt wasted. Loose living, tight fitting. What you see ain't what you are getting. Big make up, little break up. She wants it, he's got it. Cold blooded, hot gossip. Superficial expectations. Look at me, you can take it all. Because this face is free. Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Baby, I can even do reality. Fake honey, real plastic. Stupid cupid, fantastic. Queer thinking, straight talking. What you see ain't what you are getting. Fast loving, slow moving. No rhythm but I'm grooving. Old feeling, new beginning. Superficial expectations. Look at me, you can take it all. Because this face is free. Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Baby, I can even do reality. That's me. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Sometimes I don't recognize my own face. I look inside my eyes and find disgrace. My little white lies tell a story. I see it all, it has no glory. Look at me, you can take it all. Because this face is free. Maybe next time use your eyes and look at me. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Baby, I can even do reality. Come on and look at me. This face is free, I'm your fantasy. So who'd you wanna be, not what you see. I'm a drama queen if that's your thing. Come on and look at me, I'm your fantasy. This face is freeAll I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me. Somebody I can love for them. All this money don't mean shit. If you ain't got nobody to share it with. Love rules the world, you feel me. He don't understand you like I do. No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me. 'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love. And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you. When it hurt I ease the pain, girl. Caress your frame, get them worries off your brain, girl. I'm in your corner do what you want it's your thing, girl. Oppositess attract, but we one in the same, girl it ain't a game. So I can't play with you, wanna lay with you. Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you. In good and bad times we'll always make it through. 'Cause what we got is true no matter what they say to you. I can straight lace you, not just appearance. Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits. Be the voice of reason when you ain't tryin' hear it. You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it. Sit her on the sofa get a little closer. Touch it right, do it like a man's supposed to. Knew you was the one, that's why I chose ya. 'Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier. He don't understand you like I do. No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me. 'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love. And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you. Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy. Feel emptiness inside I can fill that void. When you spend time with your woman and listen. It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten. I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth. 'Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself. I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt. And prove to you you're more important than anything else. Worthwhile, special like my first child. When I see your face it's always like the first time. Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together and they tried yet. I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet. Hold you, mold you, drink no liquor, show you. Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to. Let it be known, I told you. And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true. He don't understand you like I do. No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me. 'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love. And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you. Don't let him sing you a sad song, no baby. Waiting for love like this too long. (You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby). All that you need I can give you. (You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on). I do, satisfy you. (You don't have to wait on him). I'm the light when you can't see, I'm that air when you can't breathe. I'm that feeling when you can't leave. Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive. So it's only you and me. When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong. I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong. Keep you away from harm, my love is protected. I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected. I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare. In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared. Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you. Wanted to be there 'cause I could hold it down for you. Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil. Make love all night, bending bed coils. You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal. This is all for you, 'cause I simply adore you. He don't understand you like I do. No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me. 'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love. And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy you. He don't understand you like I do. No he'll never make love to you like I do so give it to me. 'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love. And I can promise anything that I do is just to satisfy youDay after day. Time passed away. And I just can't get you off my mind. Nobody knows, I hide it inside. I keep on searching but I can't find. The courage to show to letting you know. I've never felt so much love before. And once again I'm thinking about. Taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah). How will I know if I let you go?. Night after night I hear myself say. Why can't this feeling just fade away?. There's no one like you (No one like you). You speak to my heart (Speak to my heart). It's such a shame we're worlds apart. I'm too shy to ask, I'm too proud to lose but sooner or later I gotta choose. And once again I'm thinking about. Taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah). How will I know if I let you go?. If I let you go ooh baby. Ooooohh. Once again I'm thinking about taking the easy way out. But if I let you go I will never know. What my life would be holding you close to me. Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah). How will I know (If I let you go?). But if I let you go I will never know (Oh baby). Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (Oh yeah). How will I know if I let you go?I met you. Before the fall of Rome. And I begged you. To let me take you home. You were wrong. I was right. You said, "Goodbye". I said, "Good night". It's all been done. It's all been done before. I knew you. Before the west was won. And I heard you say. The past was much more fun. You go your way. I'll go mine. That I'll see you. Next time. It's all been done. It's all been done before. If I put my fingers here. And if I say, "I love you dear". And if I play the same three chords. Will you just yawn and say?. "It's all been done. It's all been done before". Alone and bored. On a thirtieth century night. Will I see you. On the price is right?. Will I cry?. Will I smile?. As you run. Down the aisle. It's all been done. It's all been done. It's all been done before. It's all been done. It's all been done. It's all been doooooooone... beforeAnn Lee. Miscellaneous. 2 Times. ===================. Ann Lee - 2 Times. ===================.

Over this town followin' you. Over the trees, subways and cars. I'd try to find out who you really are. In the middle of the night. Cool, sweatin' in my bed. Got the windows open wide. Thinkin' about all the things you said. I wish I could fly out in the blue. Over this town followin' you. I'd fly over rooftops, the great boulevards. To try to find out who you really are, who you really are. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly now. I wish I could fly around and around. Over this town, the dirt on the ground. I'd follow your course of doors left ajar. To try to find out who you really are, who you really are. I'd fly and fly and fly, I wish I could fly. I wake up in a dream in the middle of the night. I wish I could fly, I wish I could flyMadonna. Ray Of Light. Nothing Really Matters. When I was very young. Nothing really mattered to me.

Been hurt in some kind of love affair?. And how many times did you swear. That you'd never love again?. How many lonely, sleepless nights?. How many lies, how many fights?. And why would you want to. Put yourself through all of that again?. Love is pain I hear you say. Love is a cruel and bitter way of. Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain. How could it be that what you need the most. Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?. You never want to feel so sad and lost again. One day you could be looking. Through an old book in rainy weather. You see a picture of her smiling at you. When you were still together. Or you could be walking down the street. And who should you chance to meet?. But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?. Why don't we turn the clock to zero honey. I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money. We're starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock all the way back. I wonder if she'll take me back. I'm thinking in a brand new way. Turn the clock to zero sister. You'll never know how much I missed her. I'm starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock to zero boss. The rivers wide we'll swim across. We're starting up a brand new day. It could happen to you. Just like it happened to me. There is simply no immunity. There's no guarantee. I say love is such a force if you find yourself in it. You need some time for reflection. You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute. Turn the clock to zero honey. I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money. We're starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock to zero Mack. I'm begging her to take me back. I'm thinking in a brand new way. Turn the clock to zero boss. The river's wide we'll swim across. We're starting up a brand new day. Turn the clock to zero buddy. Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy. We're Starting up a brand new day. I'm the rhythm in your tune. I'm the sun and you're the moon. I'm the bat and you're the cave. You're the beach and I'm the wave.

You're the flower I'm the rain. You're the tunnel I'm the train. Stand up all you lovers in the world. Stand up and be counted, every boy and every girl. Stand up all you lovers in the world. We're starting up a brand new day. You're the crop to my rotation. You're the sum of my equation. I'm the answer to your question. If you follow my suggestion. We can turn this ship around. We'll go up instead of down. You're the pan and I'm the handle. You're the flame and I'm the candle. I'm the bee and your the flower. You're the princess in the tower. I'm the mast and your the sail.

We're starting up a brand new dayCan't you hear those cavalry drums. Hijacking your equilibrium. Midnight hags in the mausoleum. Where the pixilated doctors moan. . Carnivores in the Cowloon night. Breathing freon by the candlelight. Coquettes bitch slap you so polite. Till you thank them for the tea and sympathy. . I want to defy the logic of all sex laws. Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists. I'll let you be my chaperone. (At the halfway home). I'm a full-grown man but I'm not afraid to cry. . Neptune's lips taste like fermented wine. Perfumed blokes on the Ginza line. Running buck wild like a concubine. Who's mother never held her hand. . Brief encounters in Mercedes Benz. Wearing hepatitis contact lens. Bed and breakfast getaway weekends. With Sports Illustrated moms. . I want to defy the logic of all sex laws. Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists. I'll let you be my chaperone.

I'm a full-grown man but I'm not afraid to cryWe've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change. the hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange. he asks a man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes. get a job you fucking slob is all he replied..

I've seen a rich man beg, I've seen a good man sin, I've seen a tough man cry. I've seen a loser win and a sad man grin, I heard an honest man lie. I've seen the good side of bad and the down side of up and everything between. I licked the silver spoon, drank from the golden cup and smoked the finest green. I Stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times before I broke their hearts. you know where it is yo, it usually depends on where you start.. I knew this kid Max. He used to get fast stacks out on the corner with drugs. he liked to hang out late at night, liked to get shit faced and keep pace with thugs. Until late one night there was a big gunfight. Max lost his head. he pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit and wound up dead. Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all his pain. you know it crumbles that way, at least that's what they say when you play the game.. God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news. 'cause then you really might know whats its like to have to lose. and then you really might know what its like (what its like). then you really might know what its like (what its like). then you really might know what its like (what its like). to have to lose.Oh-ohh.

And every word, every second, and every third . Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard . And when I play them, every chord is a poem . Telling the Lord how grateful I am cos I know him . The harmonies possess a sensation similar to your caress . If you asking then I'm telling you it's yes .

Do you like to boogie woogie?. Do you like to boogie woogie?. Do you like my acid rock?}The heart is a bloom. Shoots up through the stony ground. There's no room. No space to rent in this town. You're out of luck. And the reason that you had to care. The traffic is stuck. And you're not movin' anywhere. You thought you'd found a friend. To take you out of this place. Someone you could lend, a hand. In return for grace. It's a beautiful day. Sky falls, you feel like. It's a beautiful day. Don't let it get away. You're on the road. But you've got no destination. You're in the mud. In the maze of her imagination. You love this town. Even if that doesn't ring true. You've been all over. And it's been all over you. It's a beautiful day. Don't let it get away. It's a beautiful day. Touch me. Take me to that other place. Teach me and. I know I'm not a hopeless case. See the world in green and blue. See China right in front of you. See the canyons broken by cloud. See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out. See the Bedouin fires of night. See the oil fields at first light and. See the bird with a leaf in her mouth. After the flood all the colours came out. It was a beautiful day. Don't let it get away. Beautiful day. Touch me. Take me to that other place. Reach me. I know I'm not a hopeless case. What you don't have you don't need it now. What you don't know you can feel it somehow. What you don't have you don't need it now. Don't need it now. It's a beautiful dayMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?. Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad. It's not so bad. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?. Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad. It's not so bad. Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'. I left my cell, my pager. And my home phone at the bottom. I sent two letters back in autumn. You must not have got 'em. It probably was a problem. At the post office or somethin'. Sometimes I scribble addresses. Too sloppy when I jot 'em. But anyways fuck it. What's been up man, how's your daughter?. My girlfriend's pregnant too. I'm out to be a father. If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?. I'm a name her Bonnie. I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry. I had a friend kill himself over some bitch. Who didn't want him. I know you probably hear this everyday. But I'm your biggest fan. I even got the underground shit that you did with scam. I got a room full of your posters. And your pictures man. I like the shit you did with Ruckus too. That shit was fat. Anyways I hope you get this, man. Hit me back just to chat. Truly yours, your biggest fan. This is Stan. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?. Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad. It's not so bad. Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote. I hope you have the chance, I ain't mad. I just think it's fucked up, you don't answer fans. If you didn't want to talk to me. Outside the concert you didn't have to. But you could've signed an autograph for Matthew. That's my little brother man. He's only 6 years old. We waited in the blistering cold for you. For 4 hours and you just said "No". That's pretty shitty man. You're like his fuckin' idol. He wants to be just like you man. He likes you more than I do. I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein' lied to. Remember when we met in Denver. You said if I write to you, you would write back. See I'm just like you in a way. I never knew my father neither. He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her. I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs. So when I have a shitty day. I drift away and put 'em on. Cause I don't really got shit else. So that shit helps when I'm depressed. I even got a tattoo. With your name across the chest. Sometimes I even cut myself. To see how much it bleeds?. It's like Adrenaline. The pain is such a sudden rush for me. See everything you say is real. And I respect you 'cause you tell it. My girlfriend's jealous. 'Cause I talk about you 24/7. But she don't know you like. I know you Slim, no one does. She don't know what it was like?. For people like us growing up. You've gotta call me man. I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose. Sincerely yours, Stan. P.S. We should be together too. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?. Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad. It's not so bad. Dear Mister, I'm too good to call or write my fans. This'll be the last package I ever send your ass. It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?. I know you got my last two letters. I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect. So this is my cassette I'm sending you. I hope you hear it. I'm in the car right now. I'm doing 90 on the freeway. Hey Slim, I drink a fifth of vodka. Ya dare me to drive?. You know this song by Phil Collins. 'From the air in the night'. About that guy who could have saved. That other guy from drowning?. But didn't, then Phil saw it all. Then at his show he found him. That's kinda how this is. You could have rescued me from drowning. Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers, now I'm drowsy. And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call. I hope you know. I ripped all  your pictures off the wall. I loved you Slim, we could have been together. Think about it, you ruined it now. I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it. And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep. And you scream about it. I hope your conscious eats at you. And you can't breathe without me. See Slim, "Shut up bitch!. I'm trying to talk". Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk. But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up. See I ain't like you. 'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more. And then she'll die too. Well gotta go. I'm almost at the bridge now. Oh shit! I forgot!. How am I supposed to send this shit out?. My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?. Got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad. It's not so bad. Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner. But I've just been busy. You said your girlfriend's pregnant now. How far along is she?. Look I'm really flattered. You would call your daughter that. And here's an autograph for your brother. I wrote it on your starter cap. I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show. I must have missed you. Don't think I did that shit intentionally. Just to diss you. And what's this shit you said about. You like to cut your wrist too?. I say that shit just clownin' dawg. C'mon, how fucked up is you?. You got some issues Stan. I think you need some counselin''. To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls. When you get down some. And what's this shit about us. Meant to be together?. That type of shit'll make me not want us. To meet each other. I really think you and your girlfriend. Need each other. Or maybe you just need to treat her better. I hope you get to read this letter. I just hope it reaches you in time. Before you hurt yourself. I think that you'll be doin' just fine. If you'd relax a little. I'm glad I inspire you. But Stan, why are you so mad?. Try to understand. That I do want you as a fan. I just don't want you to do some crazy shit. I seen this one shit on the news. A couple weeks ago that made me sick. Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge. And had his girlfriend in the trunk. And she was pregnant with his kid. And in the car they found a tape. But it didn't say who it was to?. Come to think about it. His name was, it was you! Damn!Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I think I did it again I made you believe. We're more than just friends. Oh baby it might seem like a crush. But it doesn't mean that I'm serious. 'Cause to lose all my senses. That is just so typically me. Oh baby, baby. Oops! I did it again. I played with your heart. Got lost in the game oh baby, baby. Oops! You think I'm in love. that I'm sent from above. I'm not that innocent. You see my problem is this. I'm dreaming away. Wishing that heroes they truly exist. I cry watching the days.

Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have. Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this?. Yeah, yes it is. But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end.

Turn up your sound systems. To the sound of Carlos Santana. In the GMB ghetto blues. From the refugee camps. Oh Maria, Maria. She remind me of a West Side story. Growin' up in Spanish Harlem. She livin' a life just like a movie star. Oh Maria, Maria. She fell in love in East L.A.. To the sounds of the guitar yeah yeah. Played by Carlos Santana. Stop the lootin', stop the shootin'. Pick pocking on the corner. See as the rich is getting richer. The poor is getting poorer. Se mira Maria on the corner. Thinkin' of ways to make it better. In my mailbox there's an eviction letter. Somebody just said, "See you later". Yeah. Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola. Ahora vengo mama chola. (East Coast). Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola. Ahora vengo mama chola. Maria, Maria.   (West Coast). She remind me of a West Side story. Growin' up in Spanish Harlem. She livin' a life just like a movie star. Oh Maria, Maria. She fell in love in East L.A.. I said it to the sounds of the guitar yeah yeah. Played by Carlos Santana. I said a la favella, los colores. The streets are getting hotter. There is no water to put out the fire. Mi canto la esperanza. Se mira Maria on the corner. Thinkin' of ways to make it better. Then I looked up in the sky. Hopin' the days of paradise. Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola. Ahora vengo mama chola. (North side). Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola. Ahora vengo mama chola. (South side). Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola. Ahora vengo mama chola. (Worldwide). Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola. Ahora vengo mama chola. (Open up your eyes). Maria you know you're my lover. When the wind blows I can feel you. Through the weather and even when we're apart. It still feels like we're together. Maria, oh yeah. She remind me of a West Side story. Growin' up in Spanish Harlem. She livin' a life just like a movie star. Oh Maria, Maria. Oh, she fell in love in East L.A.. To the sounds of the guitar. Played by Carlos Santana. Put 'em up y'all. Carlos Santana with the refugee camp. Wyclef, Jerry "Wonder". Mr. Santana, GMB. Yo, Carlos man, you makin' that guitar cryMay I have your attention please?. May I have your attention please?. Will, The Real Slim Shady please stand up?. I repeat will, The Real Slim Shady please stand up?. We're gonna have a problem here. Y'all act like you never seen a white person before. Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door. And started whoopin' her ass worse than before. They first were divorce, throwin' her over furniture. It's the return of the, "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding. He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?". And Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots. Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement!. Feminist women love Eminem. Chigga chigga chigga, "Slim shady, I'm sick of him. Look at him, walkin' around grabbin' his you-know-what. Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though!". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms. Sometimes, I wanna get on T.V. and just let loose, but can't. But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose. "My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips. And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss". And that's the message that we deliver to little kids. And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is. Of course they gonna know what intercourse is. By the time they hit fourth grade. They got the discovery channel don't they?. "We ain't nothing but mammals", well, some of us cannibals. Who cut other people open like cantaloupes. But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes. Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope. But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote. Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes. I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records. Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too. You think I give a damn about a Grammy?. Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me. "But slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?". Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?. So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?. Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs. So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst. And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first. You little bitch, put me on blast on M.T.V. "Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!". I should download her audio on MP3. And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD. I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me. So I have been sent here to destroy you. And there's a million of us just like me. Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me. Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me. And just might be the next best thing but not quite me. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin' you. Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room. The only difference is I got the balls to say it. In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all. I just get on the mic and spit it. And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it. Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can. Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums. It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty. I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting. Pinchin' nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with jergens. And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working. And every single person is a slim shady lurkin'. He could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings. Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!". With his windows down and his system up. So, will the real shady please stand up?. And put one of those fingers on each hand up?. And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control. And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?. I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady. All you other slim shadys are just imitating. So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up. Please stand up, please stand up?. Ha ha. Guess there's a slim shady in all of us. Fuck it, let's all stand upA long long time ago I can still remember. How that music used to make me smile. And I knew that if I had my chance. I could make those people dance. And maybe they'd be happy for a while. Did you write the book of love. And do you have faith in God above. If the Bible tells you so. Now do you believe in Rock 'n' roll. And can music save your mortal soul. And can you teach me how to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym. You both kicked off your shoes. Man, I dig those rhythm and blues. I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck. With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck. But I knew that I was out of luck. The day the music died. I started singing. "Bye, bye, Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry. And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye. Singing this'll be the day that I die. This'll be the day that I die". I met a girl who sang the blues. And I asked her for some happy news. But she just smiled and turned away. Well, I went down to the sacred store. Where I'd heard the music years before. But the man there said the music wouldn't play. Well now, in the streets the children screamed. The lovers cried and the poets dreamed. But not a word was spoken. The church bells all were broken. And the three men I admire the most. The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost. They caught the last train for the coast. The day the music died. We started singin'. "Bye, bye, Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry. And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye. Singing this'll be the day that I die. This'll be the day that I die". Bye, bye, Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry. And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye. Singing this'll be the day that I die. This'll be the day that I die. We started singin'. We started singin'. We started singin'. We started singin'This ain't a song for the broken-hearted. No silent prayer for the faith-departed. I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd. You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud. It's my life. It's now or never. I ain't gonna live forever. I just want to live while I'm alive. (It's my life). My heart is like an open highway. Like Frankie said, "I did it my way". I just want to live while I'm alive. It's my life. This is for the ones who stood their ground. For Tommy and Gina, who never backed down. Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake. Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks. It's my life. And it's now or never. I ain't gonna live forever. I just want to live while I'm alive. (It's my life). My heart is like an open highway. Like Frankie said, "I did it my way". I just want to live while I'm alive. 'Cause it's my life. Better stand tall when they're calling you out. Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down. It's my life. And it's now or never. 'Cause I ain't gonna live forever. I just want to live while I'm alive. (It's my life). My heart is like an open highway. Like Frankie said, "I did it my way". I just want to live while I'm alive. (It's my life).

Early morning, she wakes up. Knock, knock, knock on the door. It's time for makeup, perfect smile. It's you they're all waiting for. They go?. "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?". And they say?. She's so lucky, she's a star. But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking. If there's nothing missing in my life. Then why do these tears come at night. Lost in an image, in a dream. But there's no one there to wake her up. And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning. But tell me what happens when it stops?. They go?. "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?". And they say?. She's so lucky, she's a star. But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking. If there's nothing missing in my life. Then why do these tears come at night. "Best actress, and the winner is?Lucky!". "I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky". "Oh my god?here she comes!". Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?. She is so lucky, but why does she cry?. If there's nothing missing in her life. Why do tears come at night?. She's so lucky, she's a star. But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking. If there's nothing missing in my life. Then why do these tears come at night. She's so lucky, she's a star. But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking. If there's nothing missing in my life. Then why do these tears come at nightShow me the meaning of being lonely. So many words for the broken heart. It's hard to see in a crimson love. So hard to breathe walk with me, and maybe. Nights of light so soon become wild and free I could feel the sun. Your every wish will be done. They tell me. Show me the meaning of being lonely.

My mind frame never changed 'til you came rearranged. But sometimes it seems completely forbidden. To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden. Where there's no competition and you render my condition. Though improbable it's not impossible. For a love that could be unstoppable. But wait, a fine line's between fate and destiny. Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be?. When you tell me the stories of your quest for me. Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly. And as our energies mix and begin to multiply. Everyday situations, they start to simplify. So things will never be the same between you and I. We intertwined our life forces and now we're unified. I thought that we would just be friends. Things will never be the same again. It's just the beginning it's not the end. Things will never be the same again. It's not a secret anymore. Now we've opened up the door. Starting tonight and from now on. We'll never, never be the same again. (Come on). And things will never be the same again.

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze. When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms. The whole world just fades away. The only thing I hear. Is the beating of your heart. 'Cause I can feel you breathe. It's washing over me. And suddenly I'm melting into you. There's nothing left to prove. Baby, all we need is just to be. Caught up in the touch. Slow and steady rush. Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be. I can feel you breathe, just breathe. In a way I know my heart is waking up. As all the walls come tumbling down. Closer than I've ever felt before. And I know, and you know. There's no need for words right now. I can feel you breathe. Washing over me. And suddenly I'm melting into you.

This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams. This fire burns. I realize that nothing's as it seems. I dream of rain. I dream of gardens in the desert sand. I wake in vain. I dream of love as time runs through my hand. I dream of rain. I lift my gaze to empty skies above. I close my eyes. This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love. Aman aman aman.

And little girls from Sweden. Dream of silver screen quotations. And if you want these kind of dreams. It's Californication. It's the edge of the world. And all of Western civilization. The sun may rise in the east. At least it settled in a final location. It's understood that Hollywood. Sells Californication. Pay your surgeon very well. To break the spell of aging. Celebrity skin is this your chin. Or is that war you're waging. First born unicorn. Hard core soft porn. Dream of Californication. Dream of Californication. Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world. Be my very own constellation. A teenage bride with a baby inside. Getting high on information. And buy me a star on the boulevard. It's Californication. Space may be the final frontier. But it's made in a Hollywood basement. And Cobain can you hear the spheres. Singing songs off station to station. And Alderaan's not far away. It's Californication. Born and raised by those who praise. Control of population. Everybody's been there. And I don't mean on vacation. First born unicorn. Hard core soft porn. Dream of Californication. Dream of Californication. Dream of Californication. Dream of Californication. Destruction leads to a very rough road. But it also breeds creation. And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar. They're just another good vibration. And tidal waves couldn't save the world. From Californication. Pay your surgeon very well. To break the spell of aging. Sicker then the rest there is no test. But this is what you're craving. First born unicorn. Hard core soft porn. Dream of Californication. Dream of Cailfornication. Dream of Californication.

How can you just walk away from me. When all I can do is watch you leave. 'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain. And even shared the tear. You're the only one who really knew me at all. So take a look at me now. 'Cause there's just an empty space. There's nothing left here to remind me. Just the memory of your face. So take a look at me now. 'Cause there's just an empty space. And you coming back to me is against the odds. And that's what I've got to face. I wish I could just make you turn around. Turn around and see me cry. There's so much I need to say to you. So many reasons why. You're the only one who really knew me at all. So take a look at me now. And there's just an empty space. There's nothing left here to remind me. Just the memory of your face. So take a look at me now. 'Cause there's just an empty space. But to wait for you is all I can do. And that's what I've got to face. Take a good look at me now. 'Cause l'll still be standing here. And you coming back to me is against all odds. That's the chance I've got to take. Oh, take a look at me nowWhen I'm lost in the rain. In your eyes I know I'll find the light. To light my way, when I'm scared losing ground. When my world is going crazy you can turn it all around. And when I'm down you're there pushing me to the top.

I thought it up, it brought up the past. Once you know you can never go back. I've got to take it on the otherside. Centuries are what it meant to me. A cemetery where I marry the sea. Stranger things could never change my mind. I've got to take it on the otherside. Take it on the otherside. Take it on, take it on. How long, how long will I slide?. Separate my side. I don't, I don't believe it's bad. Slit my throat, it's all I ever. Pour my life into a paper cup. The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts. She wants to know am I still a slut. I've got to take it on the otherside. Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed. A candidate for my soul mate bled. Push the trigger and pull the thread. I've got to take it on the otherside. Take it on the otherside. Take it on, take it on. How long, how long will I slide?. Separate my side. I don't, I don't believe it's bad. Slit my throat, it's all I ever. Turn me on, take me for a hard ride. Burn me out, leave me on the otherside. I yell and tell it that it's not my friend. I tear it down, I tear it down. And then it's born again. How long, how long will I slide?. Separate my side. I don't, I don't believe it's bad. Slit my throat, it's all I ever. How long? I don't believe it's bad. Slit my throat, it's all I everI've been searching for you. I heard a cry within my soul. I've never had a yearning quite like this before. Now that you are walking right through my door. All of my life, where have you been?. I wonder if I'll ever see you again. And if that day comes, I know we could win. I wonder if I'll ever see you again. A sacred gift of heaven. For better, worse, wherever. And I would never let somebody break you down. Nor take your crown, never. All of my life, where have you been?. I wonder if I'll ever see you again. And if that day comes, I know we could win. I wonder if I'll ever see you again. And every time I've always known. That you were there, upon your throne. A lonely queen without her king. I longed for you, my love forever. All of my life, where have you been?. I wonder if I'll ever see you again. And if that day comes, I know we could win. I wonder if I'll ever see you again. All of my life, where have you been?. I wonder if I'll ever see you again. And if that day comes, I know we could win. I wonder if I'll ever see you again. All of my life, where have you been?.

(What we do is what you just can't do). We are the cartoon heroes, oh,. We are the ones who're gonna last forever. We came out of a crazy mind, oh,. And walked out on a piece of paper. There's still more to come,. And everyone will be. Welcomed at the. Toon (toon). Town (town). Party!Monday night and I feel so low. Count the hours they go so slow. I know the sound of your voice. Can save my soul. City lights, streets of gold. Look out my window to the world below. Moves so fast and it feels so cold. And I'm all alone. Don't let me die. I'm losing my mind. Baby just give me a sign. And now that you're gone. I just wanna be with you. And I can't go on. I wanna be with you. Wanna be with you. I can't sleep I'm up all night. Through these tears I try to smile. I know the touch of your hand. Can save my life. Don't let me down. Come to me now. I got to be with you some how. And now that you're gone. I just wanna be with you. And I can't go on. I wanna be with you. Wanna be with you. Don't let me down. Come to me now. I got to be with you somehow. And now that you're gone.

Just wanna be with you. And I can't go on. I wanna be with you. Just wanna be with you. Just wanna be with you. Just wanna be with you. Just wanna be with youWhoo. Ooh. Oh yeah yeah. Listen. Bright lights, fancy restaurants. Everything in this world that a man could want. Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow. Still I'm lonely now. Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines. From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me. Fame and fortune still can't find. Just a grown man runnin' out of time. Even though it seems I have everything. I don't wanna be a lonely fool. All of the women, all the expensive cars. All of the money don't amount to you. So I can make believe I have everything. But I can't pretend that I don't see. That without you girl my life is incomplete. Said without you girl ahh. Listen. Your perfume, your sexy lingerie. Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday. A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love. I wasn't sure that I was. It's been a year, winter, summer, spring and fall. But bein' without you just ain't livin' ain't nothing at all. If I could travel back in time. I'd relive the days you were mine. Even though it seems I have everything. I don't wanna be a lonely fool. All of the women, all the expensive cars. All of the money don't amount to you. I can make believe I have everything. But I can't pretend that I don't see. That without you girl my life is incomplete. Oh yeah that without you girl ahh. I just can't help lovin' you. But I loved you much too late. I'd give anything. And everything. To hear you say. That you'll stay. Even though it seems I have everything. I don't wanna be a lonely fool. All of the women, all the expensive cars. All of the money don't amount to you. I can make believe I have everything. But I can't pretend that I don't see. That without you girl my life is incomplete. Even though it seems I have everything. I don't wanna be a lonely fool. All of the women, all the expensive cars. All of the money don't amount to you. I can make believe I have everything. But I can't pretend that I don't see. That without you girl my life is incomplete. Without you girl. Without you girl my life. Without you girl my life, my life is incomplete. Without you girl my life is incomplete. Oh yeah, my life is incomplete. Oh yeah, yeah, yeahSomewhere there's speaking. It's already coming in. Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind. You never could get it. Unless you were fed it. Now you're here and you don't know why. But under skinned knees and the skid marks. Past the places where you used to learn. You howl and listen. Listen and wait for the. Echoes of angels who won't return. He's everything you want. He's everything you need. He's everything inside of you. That you wish you could be. He says all the right things. At exactly the right time. But he means nothing to you. And you don't know why. You're waiting for someone. To put you together. You're waiting for someone to push you away. There's always another wound to discover. There's always something more you wish he'd say. He's everything you want. He's everything you need. He's everything inside of you. That you wish you could be. He says all the right things. At exactly the right time. But he means nothing to you. And you don't know why. But you'll just sit tight. And watch it unwind. It's only what you're asking for. And you'll be just fine. With all of your time. It's only what you're waiting for. Out of the island. Into the highway. Past the places where you might have turned. You never did notice. But you still hide away. The anger of angels who won't return. I am everything you want. I am everything you need. I am everything inside of you. That you wish you could be. I say all the right things. At exactly the right time. But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why. And I don't know why. Why. I don't knowAn empty street, an empty house. A hole inside my heart. I'm all alone, the rooms are getting. smaller.. I wonder how, I wonder why, I wonder. where they are. The days we had, the songs we sang. together.(oh yeah). And all my love, I'm holding on forever. Reaching for the love that seems so far. So I say a little prayer. And hope my dreams will take me there. Where the skies are blue, to see you once. again... my love.. All the seas from coast to coast. To find the place I Love The Most. Where the fields are green, to see you. once again... my love.. I try to read, I go to work. I'm laughing with my friends. But I can't stop to keep myself from. thinking. (oh no). I wonder how, I wonder why, I wonder. where they are. The days we had, the songs we sang. together.(oh yeah).

Baby join me in death. Won't you die. Baby join me in death. Won't you die tonight for love. Baby join me in death. This world is a cruel place. And we're here only to lose.

Won't you die. Baby join me in death. Won't you die tonight for love. Baby join me in death. Baby join me in deathI think I've already lost you. I think you're already gone. I think I'm finally scared now. You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong. I think you're already leaving. Feels like your hand is on the door. I thought this place was an empire. Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure. And I think you're so mean, I think we should try. I think I could need this in my life. And I think I'm scared, I think too much. I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing. If you're gone, maybe it's time to come home. There's an awful lot of breathing room but I can hardly move. If you're gone, baby you need to come home, come home. There's a little bit of something me an' everything in you. I bet you're hard to get over. I bet the room just won't shine. I bet my hands, I can stay here. And I bet you need more than your mind. And I think you're so mean, I think we should try. I think I could need this in my life. I think I'm just scared that I know too much. I can't relate and that's a problem I'm feeling. If you're gone, maybe it's time to come home. There's an awful lot of breathing room but I can hardly move. If you're gone, baby you need to come home, come home. There's a little bit of something me an' everything in you. I think you're so mean, I think we should try. I think I could need this in my life. And I think I'm scared, do I talk too much?. I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing. If you're gone, maybe it's time to come home. There's an awful lot of breathing room but I can hardly move. Now if you're gone, hell baby you need to come home, come home. There's a little bit of something me an' everything in you. Something me. Everything in. Something me and youWhatever, Dre, just let it run. Aiyyo, turn the beat up a little bit. Aiyyo, this song is for anyone, fuck it. Just shut up and listen, aiyyo. I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag. Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be. The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth. And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse. And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works. And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve. All this tension dispensin' these sentences. Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest. And I rest again peacefully. (Peacefully). But at least have the decency in you. To leave me alone when you freaks see me out. In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter. To not come and speak to me. (Speak to me). I don't know you and no. I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing. I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think. I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick. If you tempt me, my tank is on empty. (Is on empty). No patience is in me and if you offend me. I'm liftin' you 10 feet in the air. (Liftin' you 10 feet). I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you. Go, call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit. I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe. I'm tired of all you. (Of all you). I don't mean to be mean. But that's all I can be is just me. And I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am. Radio won't even play my jam. 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am. I don't know it's just the way I am. Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered. With all of this nonsense, it's constant. And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song. 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses". And all of this controversy circles me. And it seems like the media immediately. Points a finger at me. (Finger at me). So I point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie. Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up. When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up. With the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too. When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school. And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin. (On Marilyn). Where were the parents at? And look where it's at. Middle America, now, it's a tragedy. Now, it's so sad to see, an upper class city. Havin' this happenin'. (This happenin'). Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way. (Rap this way). But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire. To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned. And I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am. Radio won't even play my jam. 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am. I don't know it's just the way I am. I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired. That I wish that I would just die or get fired. And dropped from my label and stop with the fables. I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name is". And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation. To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations. And I just do not got the patience. (Got the patience). To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think. I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk. With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin'. The same fuckin' questions. (Fuckin' questions). What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?. The why, the who what when, the where and the how. 'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out. 'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it. (Drivin' me crazy). I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit. And I'm thankful for every fan that I get. But I can't take a shit in the bathroom. Without someone standin' by it. No, I won't sign your autograph. You can call me an asshole I'm glad. 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am. Radio won't even play my jam. 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am. If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news everyday I am. I don't know it's just the way I amBaby set me free from this misery. I can't take it no more. Since you ran away nothing's been the same. Don't know what I'm living for. Here I am so alone. And there's nothing in this world I can do. Until you're back here, baby. Miss you, want you, need you so. Until you're back here, baby, yeah. There's a feeling inside. I want you to know. You are the one. And I can't let you go. So I told you lies even made you cry. Baby I was so wrong. Girl, I promise you now my love is true. This is where my heart belongs. 'Cause here I am so alone. And there's nothing in this world I can do. Until you're back here, baby. Miss you, want you, need you so. Until you're back here, baby, yeah. There's a feeling inside. I want you to know. You are the one. And I can't let you go. And I wonder. Are you thinking of me 'cause I'm thinking of you. And I wonder. Are you ever coming back in my life. 'Cause here I am so alone. And there's nothing in this world I can do. Until you're back here, baby. Miss you, want you, need you so. Until you're back here, baby, yeah. There's a feeling inside. I want you to know. You are the one. And I can't. Until you're back here, baby. Until you're back here, baby. Until you're back here, baby. There's a feeling inside. I want you to know. You are the one. And I can't. Until you're back here, baby. Until you're back here, baby. Until you're back here, baby. ...Got introduced to you by a friend. You were cute and all that, baby you set the trend, yes you did oh. The next thing I know we're down at the cinema. We're sitting there you start kissing me. What's that about?. You're moving too fast, I don't understand you. I'm not ready yet, baby, I can't pretend, no I can't. The best I can do is tell you to talk to me. It's possible, eventual, love will find a way. Love will find a way. Don't say you love me, you don't even know me. If you really want me then give me some time. Don't go there baby, not before I'm ready. Don't say your heart's in a hurry. It's not like we're gonna get married, give me, give me some time. Here's how I play, here's where you stand. Here's what to prove to get any further than where it's been. I'll make it clear, not gonna tell you twice. Take it slow, keep pushing me, you're pushing me away. Pushing me away. Don't say you love me, you don't even know me. If you really want me then give me some time. Don't go there baby, not before I'm ready. Don't say your heart's in a hurry. It's not like we're gonna get married, give me, give me, some time. Don't say you love me, you don't even know me, baby. Don't say you love me, you don't even know me. If you really want me then give me some time. Don't say you love me, you don't even know me. If you really want me then give me some time. Don't go there baby not before I'm ready. Don't say your heart's in a hurry. It's not like we're gonna get married, give me, give me, some time. Baby, don't say you love me, you don't even know me. If you really want me then give me some time. Don't go there baby, not before I'm ready. Don't say your heart's in a hurry. It's not like we're gonna get married, give me, give me some time. Don't say you love me, you don't even know me. If you really want me then give me some time. Don't go there baby not before I'm readyI'm a worried man, got a worried mind. No one in front of me, no one behind. There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne. Got white skin, got assassins eyes. I'm looking up into the sapphire tinted skies. I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train. Standin' on the gallows with my head in a noose. Any minute now I'm expectin' all hell to break loose. People are crazy and times are strange. I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range. I used to care, but things have changed. This place ain't doing me any good. I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood. Just for a second there I thought I saw something move. Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag. Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag. Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove. Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too. Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through. People are crazy and times are strange. I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range. I used to care, but things have changed. I've been walking forty miles of bad road. If the Bible is right, the world will explode. I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can. Some things are too hot to touch. The human mind can only stand so much. You can't win with a losin' hand. Feel like fallin' in love with the first woman I meet. Puttin' her in a wheel barrow and wheelin' her down the street. People are crazy and times are strange. I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range. I used to care, but things have changed. I hurt easy, I just don't show it. You can hurt someone and not even know it. The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity. Gonna get low down, gonna fly high. All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie. I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me. Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake. I'm not that eager, not that eager to make a mistake. People are crazy, times are strange. I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range. I used to care, but things have changedSpinning around. Spinning around. Ohh. I'm spinning around, move out of my way. I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this. I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same. I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this. Traded in my sorrows for some joy that I borrowed. From back in the day. Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe. I got something to say. I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back. The future will be. And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction. And it leads back to me?. I'm spinning around, move out of my way. I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this. I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same. I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it. The mistakes I've made, have given me the strength. To really believe. And no matter how I take it, there's no way I'm gonna fake it. 'Cuz it's gotta be real. I've got nothin' left to hide, no reason left to fight. 'Cuz the truth's given me. A new freedom inside, gettin' rid of my desire. Do you like what you see?. I'm spinning around, move out of my way. I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this. I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same. I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this. Baby, baby, baby. You know you like it like this. Oh, baby, baby, baby. You know you like it like this. Oh, baby, baby, baby. I'm spinning around, move out of my way. I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this. I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same. I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this. Feelin' me 'cause you like it like this, oh, I'm not the same. I know you like it like this, oh, ooh yeah.

You let her catch you?. I don't know how I let this happen. With who?. The girl next door, you know?. Man.... I don't know what to do. Say it wasn't you. Alright. Honey came in and she caught me red-handed. Creeping with the girl next door. Picture this we were both butt-naked. Banging on the bathroom floor. How could I forget. That I had given her an extra key. All this time she was standing there. She never took her eyes off me. How you can grant the woman access to your villa. Trespasser and a witness while you cling on your pillow. You better watch your back before she turn into a killer. Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner. To be a true player you have to know how to play. If she say a night, convince her say a day. Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim. And you tell her baby no way. But she caught me on the counter. (It wasn't me). Saw me banging on the sofa. (It wasn't me). I even had her in the shower. (It wasn't me). She even caught me on camera. (It wasn't me). She saw the marks on my shoulder. (It wasn't me). Heard the words that I told her. (It wasn't me). Heard the screams getting louder. (It wasn't me). She stayed until it was over. Honey came in and she caught me red-handed. Creeping with the girl next door. Picture this we were both butt-naked. Banging on the bathroom floor. I had tried to keep her from what she was about to see. Why should she believe me when I told her it wasn't me. Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on. Da right prefix whenever you should see her make da giggolo flex. As funny as it be by you, it not that complex. Seein' is believin' so you better change your specs. You know she not gonna be worrying about things from the past. Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass. Your answer: go over there but if she pack a gun. You know you better run fast. But she caught me on the counter. (It wasn't me). Saw me banging on the sofa. (It wasn't me). I even had her in the shower. (It wasn't me). She even caught me on camera. (It wasn't me). She saw the marks on my shoulder. (It wasn't me). Heard the words that I told her. (It wasn't me). Heard the screams getting louder. (It wasn't me). She stayed until it was over. Honey came in and she caught me red-handed. Creeping with the girl next door. Picture this we were both butt-naked. Banging on the bathroom floor. How could I forget. That I had given her an extra key. All this time she was standing there. She never took her eyes off me. Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused. I've been listenin' to your reasonin'. It makes no sense at all. We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused. You may think that you're a player. But you're completely lost. Honey came in and she caught me red-handed. Creeping with the girl next door. Picture this we were both butt-naked. Banging on the bathroom floor. How could I forget. That I had given her an extra key. All this time she was standing there. She never took her eyes off meGirl you're my angel, you're my darling angel. Closer than my peeps you are to me baby.

So just dance for meI'm desperate for changing. Starving for truth. I'm closer to where I started. I'm chasing after you. I'm falling even more in love with you. Letting go of all I've held onto. I'm standing here until you make me move. I'm hanging by a moment here with you. Forgetting all I'm lacking. Completely incomplete. I'll take your invitation. You take all of me now. I'm falling even more in love with you. Letting go of all I've held onto. I'm standing here until you make me move. I'm hanging by a moment here with you. I'm living for the only thing I know. I'm running and not quite sure where to go. And I don't know what I'm diving into. Just hanging by a moment here with you. There's nothing else to lose. There's nothing else to find. There's nothing in the world. That can change my mind. There is nothing else. There is nothing else. There is nothing else. I'm desperate for changing. I'm starving for truth. I'm closer to where I started. I'm chasing after you. I'm falling even more in love with you. Letting go of all I've held onto. I'm standing here until you make me move. I'm hanging by a moment here with you. I'm living for the only thing I know. I'm running and not quite sure where to go. And I don't know what I'm diving into. Just hanging by a moment here with you. Just hanging by a moment. Hanging by a moment. Hanging by a moment. Hanging by a moment here with youIt starts with. One thing I don't know why. It doesn't even matter how hard you try. Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme. To explain in due time. All I know. Time is a valuable thing. Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings. Watch it count down to the end of the day. The clock ticks life away. It's so unreal. Didn't look out below. Watch the time go right out the window. Trying to hold on, but didn't even know. Or wasted it all just to watch you go. I kept everything inside. And even though I tried, it all fell apart. What it meant to me will eventually be. A memory of a time when. I tried so hard and got so far. But in the end it doesn't even matter. I had to fall to lose it all. But in the end it doesn't even matter. One thing, I don't know why. It doesn't even matter how hard you try. Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme. To remind myself how. I tried so hard. In spite of the way you were mocking me. Acting like I was part of your property. Remembering all the times you fought with me. I'm surprised. It got so far. Things aren't the way they were before. You wouldn't even recognize me anymore. Not that you knew me back then. But it all comes back to me in the end. You kept everything inside. And even though I tried, it all fell apart. What it meant to me will eventually be. A memory of a time when. I tried so hard and got so far. But in the end it doesn't even matter. I had to fall to lose it all. But in the end it doesn't even matter. I've put my trust in you. Pushed as far as I can go. And for all this. There's only one thing you should know. I've put my trust in you. Pushed as far as I can go. And for all this. There's only one thing you should know. I tried so hard and got so far. But in the end it doesn't even matter. I had to fall to lose it all. But in the end it doesn't even matterI was gonna clean my room until I got high. I was gonna get up and find the broom but then I got high. My room is still messed up and I know why. 'Cause I got high. Because I got high. Because I got high.

Since the return from her stay on the moon. She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey . But tell me, did you sail across the sun?. Did you make it to the Milky Way. To see the lights all faded. And that heaven is overrated?. Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?. One without a permanent scar. And then you missed me. While you were looking for yourself out there?.  . Now that she's back from that soul vacation. Tracing her way through the constellation, hey. She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo. Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey.  . Now that she's back in the atmosphere. I'm afraid that she might think of me as. Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man. Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land.  . But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?. Did you finally get the chance. To dance along the light of day. And head back to the Milky Way?. And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?. Was it everything you wanted to find?. And then you missed me. While you were looking for yourself out there.  . Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken. Your best friend always sticking up for you. Even when I know you're wrong?. Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance. Five-hour phone conversation. The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?.  . But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?. Did you finally get the chance. To dance along the light of day. And head back toward the Milky Way?.  . But tell me, did you sail across the sun?. Did you make it to the Milky Way. To see the lights all faded. And that heaven is overrated?. And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?. One without a permanent scar. And then you missed me. While you were looking for yourself?. And did you finally get the chance. To dance along the light of day?. And did you fall for a shooting star?. Fall for a shooting star?. And now you're lonely looking for yourself out thereEnya. A Day Without Rain. Only Time.

But to tell truth I really never knew 'til I met you. I was lost and confused, twisted and used up. Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it. My lifestyles wild, I was living like a wild child. Trapped on a short leash, paroled the police files. And yo, what' s happening now?. I see the sun breaking, shining through dark clouds.

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me. It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be. But there are facts in our lives we can never change. Just tell me that you understand and feel the same. This perfect romance that I've created in my mind (In my mind). I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side. But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance. And so it seems like we'll never have the chance. Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny.

I pushed you far away. And yet you stayed with me. I guess this means that you and me were meant to be. Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny. And you can't move on even though you try. Ain't it strange when your feeling things you shouldn't feel. Oh, I wish this could be real, oh yeah.

I know that there's a chance. you won't be leaving with me. And afterwards we drop. into a quiet little place. and have a drink or two. And then I go and spoil it all. by saying something stupid. like:"I love you". I can see it in your eyes. you still despise the same old lines. you heard the night before. And though it's just a line to you. for me it's true. and never seemed so right before. I practice everyday. to find some clever lines to say. to make the meaning come true. But then I think I'll wait. until the evening gets late. and I'm alone with you. The time is right your perfume fills my head. the stars get red. and oh, the night's so blue.

I'm reminded when I look at you. But you remind of a girl that I once knew. See her face whenever I, I look at you. You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. This is why I just can't get it with you. Thought that she was the one for me. 'Til I found out she was on her dream. Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me. This is why we could never be. You remind of a girl that I once knew. See her face whenever I, I look at you. You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. This is why I just can't get it with you. I know it's so unfair to you. But I'd be lingering the rest to you. Wish I knew. Wish I knew how to separate the two. You remind me, oh. You remind of a girl, that I once knew. See her face whenever I, I look at you. You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. This is why I just can't get it with you. ...Aerosmith. Just Push Play. Jaded.

Sometimes some people get me wrong. When it's something I've said or done. Sometimes you feel there is no fun. That's why you turn and run. But now I truly realize. Some people don't wanna compromise. Well, I saw them with my own eyes. Spreading those lies, yeah. Well, I don't wanna live a lie. Too many sleepless nights. Not mentioning the fights.

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad. I got sunshine in a bag. I'm useless but not for long. The future is coming on. It's coming on, it's coming on. (Rah, yeah). It's coming on, it's coming on. Finally someone let me out of my cage. Now time for me is nothin' 'cos I'm counting no age. Now I couldn't be there now you shouldn't be scared. I'm good at repairs and I'm under each snare. Intangible (ah y'all) I bet you didn't think so. I command you to, panoramic view (you). Look I'll make it all manageable. Pick and choose, sit and lose. All you different crews. Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes. Picture you getting down and I'll picture too. Like you lit the fuse. You think it's fictional, mystical - maybe. Spiritual hero who appears on you to clear your view (yeah). When you're too crazy. Lifeless for whose definition is for what life is. Priceless to you because I put ya on the hype shift. Did ya like it?. Gut smokin' righteous but one talkin' psychic. But among knows possess you with one though. I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad. I got sunshine in a bag. I'm useless but not for long.

It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on. The essence, the basics without it you make it. Allow me to make this child like a nature. Rhythm you have it or you don't. That's a fallacy, I'm in them. Every spiralling tree, every child of peace. Every cloud I see you see with your eyes. You see destruction and demise. (That's right). Corruption in the skies. From this fucking enterprise that I'm sucked into your lies. The Russell that is muscles. The percussion he provides. For me I say God, y'all can see me now. 'Cos you don't see with your eye. You perceive with your mind. That's the end of it. So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor. Bust a few rounds of motherfuckers. Remember but the thought is. I brought all this so you can survive when law is lawless (right here). Fearless, sensations that you thought was dead. No squealing, remember that it's all in your head.

When he invites me over, I come every time. And when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride. Whatever way we go it's delirium time. He's all mine and his lovin' makes me high. Like a taste of ecstasy all I need is him to be my loverboy. Loverboy come on and love me. Give me more, touch me and touch me. I enjoy the way you rock me. All night long. Loverboy come on and take me. Only you know how to make me. Shudder with anticipation. All night long. I got myself a lover and he's so sublime. It's quite a bit of heaven to feel him inside. 'Cause when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride. Whatever way we go it's delirium time. I get weak when his candy kisses sweetly. Caress my whole body, all I need is him to be, my loverboy. Loverboy come on and love me. Give me more, touch me and touch me. I enjoy the way you rock me. All night longAnd it's been awhile, since I could hold my head up high. And it's been awhile, since I first saw you. And it's been awhile, since I could stand on my own two feet again. And it's been awhile, since I could call you. And everything I can't remember. As fucked up as it all may seem. The consequences that I've rendered. I stretched myself beyond my means. And it's been awhile, since I can say that I wasn't addicted. And it's been awhile, since I can say I love myself as well. And it's been awhile, since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do. And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you. And everything I can't remember. As fucked up as it all may seem. The consequences that I've rendered. I've gone and fucked things up again. Why must I feel this way?. Just make this go away. Just one more peaceful day. And it's been awhile, since I could look at myself straight. And it's been awhile, since I said I'm sorry. And it's been awhile, since I've seen the way the candles light your face. And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste. And everything I can't remember. As fucked up as it all may seem to be I know it's me. I cannot blame this on my father. He did the best he could for me. And it's been awhile, since I could hold my head up high. And it's been awhile, since I said I'm sorryUh, I mean I'm just sittin' right here. Checking out this young lady right here.

But everything about you is so irresistible. Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type. To hide what I feel inside. When he makes me weak with desire. I know that I'm supposed to make him wait. Let him think I like the chase. But I cant stop fanning the fire. I know I meant to say no. But he's irresistible, up close and personal. Now inescapable, I can hardly breathe. More than just physical, deeper than spiritual. His ways are powerful and irresistible to me, I can hardly breathe. Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right. That I should really say goodnight. But I can't stop myself from falling. Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same. That I don't want to play no game. 'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me. I know meant to say no. But he's irresistible, up close and personal. Now inescapable, I can hardly breathe. More than just physical, deeper than spiritual. His ways are powerful and irresistible to me. Can't you see whenever he's close to me. I really find it hard to breathe?. He's so irresistible. Baby, you know it's more than just spiritual. His kisses are powerful. He's so irresistible. But he's irresistible, up close and personal. Now inescapable, I can hardly breathe. More than just physical, deeper than spiritual. His ways are powerful, irresistible to me. He's irresistible, up close and personal. Now inescapable, I can hardly breathe. More than just physical, deeper than spiritual. His ways are powerful and irresistible to meWhile he was scheming. I was beamin' in the Beamer just beamin'. Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'. So I found another way to make him pay for it all. So I went. To Neiman-Marcus on a shopping spree. And on the way I grabbed Soley and Mia. And as the cash box rang I thought everything away. (Oops). There goes the dreams we used to say. (Oops). There goes the time we spent away. (Oops). There goes the love I had but you cheated on me. And that's worth that now. (Oops). There goes the house we made a home. (Oops). There goes you'll never leave me alone. For all the lies you told, this is what you owe. Hey ladies. When your man wanna get buckwild. Just go back and hit 'em up style. Put your hands on his cash. And spend it to the last dime. For all the hard times. Oh, when you go then everything goes. From the crib to the ride and the clothes.

Where the sound of the crowd is so far away. You take my hand, and it feels like home. We both understand, it's where we belong. So how do I say, do I say goodbye?. We both have our dreams, we both wanna fly. So let's take tonight, to carry us through. The lonely times. I'll always look back as I walk away. This memory will last for eternity. And all of our tears will be lost in the rain. When I find my way back to your arms again. But until that day you know you are. The queen of my heart, the queen of my heart. So let's take tonight and never let go. While dancing we'll kiss, like there's no tomorrow. As the stars sparkle down, like a diamond ring. I'll treasure this moment till we meet again. But no matter how far. (No matter how far). Or where you may be. (Where you may be). I just close my eyes. (Just close my eyes). And you're in my dreams. And there you will be until we meet. I'll always look back as I walk away. This memory will last for eternity. And all off our tears will be lost in the rain. When I find my way back to your arms again. But until that day you know you are. The queen of my heart. I'll always look back as I walk away. This memory will last for eternity. And all off our tears will be lost in the rain. When I find my way back to your arms again. But until that day you know you are. The queen of my heart. Oh yeah. You're the queen of my heart. (Queen of my heart). No matter how many years it takes. (Queen of my heart). I'll do it all to you, oh yeah. (Queen of my heart). Oh yes you are. The queen of my heartI don't wanna say I'm sorry. 'Cause I know there is nothing wrong. Don't be afraid there is no need to worry. 'Cause my feelings for you are still strong. Hold me in your arms. And never let me go. Hold me in your arms. 'Cause I need you so. I can see it in your eyes, there is something. Something you wanna tell me. I see it in your eyes, there is something. That you hide from me. Is there a reason why? There is something. Something you wanna tell me. I see it in your eyes, there is something. That you hide for me. I don't wanna say I'm sorry. 'Cause I know there is nothing wrong. Don't be afraid there is no need to worry. 'Cause my feelings for you are still strong. Hold me in your arms. And never let me go. Hold me in your arms. 'Cause I need you so.

Something you wanna tell me. I see it in your eyes, there is something. That you hide for meHere I stand alone. With this weight upon my heart. And it will not go away. In my head, I keep on looking back. Right back to the start. Wondering what it was that made you change. Well, I tried, but I had to draw the line. And still this question keeps on spinning in my mind. What if I had never let you go?. Would you be the man I used to know?. If I'd stayed, if you'd tried. If we could only turn back time. But I guess we'll never know. Many roads to take. Some to joy, some to heart-ache. Anyone can lose their way. And if I said that we could turn it back. Right back to the start. Would you take the chance and make the change?. Do you think how it would have been sometimes?. Do you pray that I'd never left your side?. What if I had never let you go?. Would you be the man I used to know?. If I'd stayed, if you'd tried. If we could only turn back time. But I guess we'll never know. If only we could turn the hands of time. If I could take you back would you still be mine. 'Cos I tried, but I had to draw the line. And still this question keeps on spinning in my mind. What if I had never let you go?. Would you be the man I used to know?. What if I had never walked away?. 'Cos I still love you more than I can say?. If I'd stayed, if you'd tried. If we could only turn back time. But I guess we'll never know. We'll never knowAs bony fingers close around me long and spindly death becomes me. Heaven can you see what I see. Hey you pale and sickly child you're death and living reconciled. Been walking home a crooked mile. Paying debt to karma. You party for a living. What you take won't kill you. But careful what you're giving. Can you feel a little love?. Can you feel a little love?. Dream on dream on. There's no time for hesitating pain is ready, pain is waiting. Primed to do it's educating. Unwanted, uninvited kin it creeps beneath your crawling skin. It lives without it lives within you. Feel the fever coming. You're shaking and twitching. You can scratch all over. But that won't stop you itching. Can you feel a little love?. Can you feel a little love?. Dream on dream on. Blame it on your karmic curse or shame upon the Universe. It knows its lines it's well rehearsed. It sucked you in it dragged you down to where there is no hallow ground. Where holiness is never found. Paying debt to karma. You party for a living. What you take won't kill you. But careful what you're giving. Can you feel a little love?. Can you feel a little love?. Dream on dream on. Can you feel a little love?. Can you feel a little love?. Dream on dream on. Dream on dream onTurn it inside out so I can see. The part of you that's driftin' over me. And when I wake you're, you never there. But when I sleep you're, you everywhere. You everywhere. . Just tell me, how I got this far?. Just tell me, why you're here? And who you are?. 'Cause every time I look, you're never there. And every time I sleep, you're always there. . 'Cause you're everywhere to me. And when I close my eyes it's you I see. You're everything I know. That makes me believe. I'm not alone, ooo ooo ooo. I'm not alone. . I recognize the way you make me feel. It's hard to think that you might not be real. I sense it now the water's getting deep. I try to wash the pain away from me. Away from me. . 'Cause you're everywhere to me. And when I close my eyes it's you I see. You're everything I know. That makes me believe. I'm not alone, ooo ooo. I'm not alone. . I am not alone. Waa ooo, waa ooo, waa ooo, waa. . And when I touch your hand. It's then I understand. The beauty that's within. It's now that we begin. You always light my way. I hope there never comes a day aay aay. No matter where I go. I'll always feel you so. . 'Cause you're everywhere to me. And when I close my eyes it's you I see. You're everything I know. That makes me believe. I'm not alone, waa waa ohh yea. . 'Cause you're everywhere to me. And when I catch my breath. It's you I breathe. You're everything I know. That makes me believe. I'm not alone, waa waa ohh. . You're in everyone I see. So tell me. Do you see me?I hope you never lose your sense of wonder. You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger. May you never take one single breath for granted. God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed. I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean. Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens. Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance. And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance. I hope you dance. I hope you dance. I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance. Never settle for the path of least resistance. Living might mean taking chances but they're worth taking. Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth making. Don't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter. When you come close to selling out reconsider. Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance. And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance. I hope you dance. (Time is a wheel in constant motion always). I hope you dance. (Rolling us along). I hope you dance. (Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder). I hope you dance. (Where those years have gone). I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean. Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens. Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance. And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance. Dance. I hope you dance. (Dance). I hope you dance. (Time is a wheel in constant motion always). I hope you dance. (Rolling us along). I hope you dance. (Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder). I hope you dance. (Where those years have gone). Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder. (Dance). Where those years have gone. (Dance)Downtown's been caught by the hysteria. People scream and shout. A generation's on the move. When disco spreads like a bacteria. These lonely days are out. Welcome the passion of the groove. The golden years. The silver tears. You wore a tie like Richard Gere. I wanna get down. You spin me around. I stand on the borderline. Cryin' at the discotheque. Cryin' at the discotheque. I saw you cryin'. I saw you cryin' at the discotheque. I saw you cryin'. I saw you cryin' at the discotheque. Tonight's the night at the danceteria. The joinin' of the tribe. The speakers blasting clear and loud. The way you dance is our criteria. The D.J. takes you high. Let tears of joy baptise the crowd. The golden years. The silver tears. You wore a tie like Richard Gere. I wanna get down. You spin me around. I stand on the borderline. Cryin' at the discotheque. Cryin' at the discotheque. I saw you cryin'. I saw you cryin' at the discotheque. I saw you cryin'. I saw you cryin' at the discotheque. The passion of the groove. Generation on the move. Joinin' of the disco tribe. Let the music take you high. The golden years. The silver tears. You wore a tie like Richard Gere. I wanna get down. You spin me around. I stand on the borderline. Cryin' at the discotheque. Cryin' at the discotheque. Cryin' at the discotheque. ...Close your eyes so you don't feel them. They don't need to see you cry. I can't promise I will heal you. But if you want to I will try. Sing this summer serenade. The past is done, we've been betrayed. It's true, some might say the truth will out. But I believe without a doubt in you. You were there for summer dreaming. And you gave me what I need. And I hope you find your freedom. For eternity, for eternity. Yesterday when we were walking. You talked about your mom and dad. What they did that made you happy. What they did that made you sad. We sat and watched the sun go down. Then picked a star before we lost. The moon, youth is wasted on the young. Before you know it's come and gone too soon. You were there for summer dreaming. And you gave me what I need. And I hope you find your freedom. For eternity, for eternity. You were there for summer dreaming. And you are a friend indeed. And I hope you find your freedom for eternity. You were there for summer dreaming. And you are a friend indeed. And I know you find your freedom. Eventually, for eternity, for eternityWhen it's over. That's the time I fall in love again. And when it's over. That's the time you're in my heart again. And when you go go go go. I know. It never ends. Never ends. All the things that I used to say. All the words that got in the way. All the things that I used to know. Have gone out the window. All the things that she used to bring. All the songs she used to sing. All the favorite TV shows. Have gone out the window. I'm missing you. I never knew how much she'd loved me. I'm missing you. I never knew how much you meant to me. I need you and when you go go go go. I know. It never ends.

All the songs she used to sing. All the favorite TV shows. Have gone out the window. I'm wishing you. You never said you were pretending. I'm wishing you. You feel the same and just come back to me. I need you and when you go go go go. I know. It never ends. Never ends. When it's over. Can I still come over. And when it's over. Is it really over. When it's over.

My heart's bruised. Was I ever loved by you?. Out of reach, so far. I never had your heart. Out of reach. Couldn't see. We were never. Meant to be. Catch myself. From despair. I could drown. If I stay here. Keeping busy everyday. I know I will be OK. But I was. So confused. My heart's bruised. Was I ever loved by you?. Out of reach, so far. I never had your heart. Out of reach. Couldn't see. We were never. Meant to be. So much hurt. So much pain. Takes a while. To regain. What is lost inside. And I hope that in time. You'll be out of my mind. And I'll be over you. But now I'm. So confused. My heart's bruised. Was I ever loved by you?. Out of reach, so far. I never had your heart. Out of reach. Couldn't see. We were never. Meant to be. Out of reach. So far. You never gave your heart. In my reach, I can see. There's a life out there. For meSometimes, I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear. And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear. Take the wheel and steer. It's driven me before and seems to have a vague. Haunting mass appeal. But lately I'm beginning to find that I. Should be the one behind the wheel. Whatever tomorrow brings. I'll be there with open arms and open eyes yea. Whatever tomorrow brings. I'll be there I'll be there. So, if I decide to waiver my chance. To be one of the hive. Will I choose water over wine. And hold my own and drive?. Aah ah ooo. It's driven me before and it seems to be the way. That everyone else gets around. But lately I'm beginning to find that when. I drive myself my light is found. Whatever tomorrow brings. I'll be there with open arms and open eyes yea. Whatever tomorrow brings. I'll be there I'll be there. Would you choose water over wine?. Hold the wheel and drive. Whatever tomorrow brings. I'll be there with open arms and open eyes yea. Whatever tomorrow brings. I'll be there I'll be thereLook. If you had one shot, or one opportunity. To seize everything you ever wanted. One moment. Would you capture it or just let it slip?. Yo. His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy. There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti. He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs. But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud. He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out. He's choking how, everybody's joking now. The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!. Snap back to reality. Oh, there goes gravity. Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked. He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no. He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes. It don't matter, he's dope. He knows that but he's broke. He's so stagnant, he knows when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's. Back to the lab again, yo. This whole rhapsody. He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him. You better lose yourself in the music, the moment. You own it, you better never let it go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime. You better lose yourself in the music, the moment. You own it, you better never let it go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime. You better. The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping. This world is mine for the taking. Make me king, as we move toward a new world order. A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem. It only grows harder, homie grows hotter. He blows, it's all over. These hoes is all on him. Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter. Lonely roads, God only knows. He's grown farther from home, he's no father. He goes home and barely knows his own daughter. But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water. His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product. They moved on to the next schmoe who flows. He nose dove and sold nada. So the soap opera is told and unfolds. I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on. Da da dum da dum da da. You better lose yourself in the music, the moment. You own it, you better never let it go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime. You better lose yourself in the music, the moment. You own it, you better never let it go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime. You better. No more games, I'ma change what you call rage. Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged. I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed. I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage. But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher. Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper. All the pain inside amplified by the fact. That I can't get by with my 9 to 5. And I can't provide the right type of life for my family. 'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers. And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life. And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder. Trying to feed and water my seed, plus. Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna. Baby mama drama's screaming on and. Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony. Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot. Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not. Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go. I cannot grow old in Salem's lot. So here I go it's my shot. Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got. You better. Lose yourself in the music, the moment. You own it, you better never let it go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime. You better lose yourself in the music, the moment. You own it, you better never let it go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime. You better. You can do anything you set your mind to, manObie Trice, real name no gimmicks. Two trailer park girls go round the outside. Round the outside, round the outside.

Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you. A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor. Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker. Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital. By the doctor when I'm not co-operating. When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating. You waited this long, now stop debating. 'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating. I know that you got a job Ms.Cheney. But your husband's heart problem's complicating. So the FCC won't let me be. Or let me be me, so let me see. They try to shut me down on MTV.

Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis. They start feelin' like prisoners helpless. 'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch. A visionary, vision of scary. Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves. A rebel, so just let me revel and bask. In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass. And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe. For you to see so damn much of my ass. You asked for me? Well I'm back. Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna. Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter.

It's over, nobody listen to techno. Now let's go, just gimme the signal. I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults. I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil. Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol. But sometimes the shit just seems. Everybody only wants to discuss me. So this must mean I'm disgusting. But it's just me, I'm just obscene. No I'm not the first king of controversy. I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley. To do black music so selfishly. And used it to get myself wealthy. There's a concept that works.

Who will be there to take my place?. When I'm gone, you'll need love. To light the shadows on your face. If a great wave shall fall. And fall upon us all. Then between the sand and stone. Could you make it on your own?. If I could, then I would. I'll go wherever you will go. Way up high or down low. I'll go wherever you will go. And maybe, I'll find out. A way to make it back someday. To watch you, to guide you. Through the darkest of your days. If a great wave shall fall. And fall upon us all. Then I hope there's someone out there. Who can bring me back to youI. f I could, then I would. I'll go wherever you will go. Way up high or down low. I'll go wherever you will go. Run away with my heart. Run away with my hope. Run away with my love. I know now, just quite how. My life and love might still go on. In your heart, in your mind. I'll stay with you for all of time. If I could, then I would. I'll go wherever you will go. Way up high or down low. I'll go wherever you will go. If I could turn back time. I'll go wherever you will go. If I could make you mine. I'll go wherever you will go. I'll go wherever you will goStandin' in line to see the show tonight. And there's a light on, heavy glow. By the way I tried to say. I'd be there waiting for. Dani, the girl is singin' songs to me. Beneath the marquee, overload. Steak knife. Card shark. Con job. Boot cut. Skin that flick. She's such a little DJ. To get there quick. By street but not the freeway. Turn that trick. To make a little leeway. Beat that nic. But not the way that we play. Dogtown. Blood bath. Rib cage. Soft tail. Standin' in line to see the show tonight. And there's a light on, heavy glow. By the way I tried to say. I'd be there waiting for. Black Jack. Dope Dick. Pawn shop. Quick pick. Kiss that dyke. I know you want to hold one. Not on strike. But I'm about to bowl one. Bite that mic. I know you never stole one. Girls that like a story. So I told one. Song bird. Main line. Cash back. Hard top. Standin' in line to see the show tonight. And there's a light on, heavy glow. By the way I tried to say. I'd be there waiting for. Dani, the girl is singin' songs to me. Beneath the marquee of her soul. By the way I tried to say. I'd be there waiting for. Oh, ah, kissed ya then I missed ya. Oh, ah, kissed ya then I missed ya. Oh, ah, kissed ya then I missed ya. Oh, ah, kissed ya then I missed ya.

You found somebody who makes you change your ways. Like hanging with your crew. Said you act like you're ready. But you don't really know. And everything in your past, you wanna let it go. I've been there, done it, humped around. After all that - this is what I found. Nobody wants to be alone. If you're touched by the words in this song. Then baby.... U got, u got it bad. When you're on the phone. Hang up and you call right back. U got, u got it bad. If you miss a day without your friend. Your whole life's off track. You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house. You don't wanna have fun. It's all you think about. U got it bad when you're out with someone. But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else. U got it bad. When you say that you love 'em. And you really know. Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more. Like my money, all my cars. (You can have it all back). Flowers, cards, and candy. (I do it just cause I'm...). Said I'm fortunate to have you girl. I want you to know. I really adore you. All my people who know what's going on. Look at your mate, help me sing my song. Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl. I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world. Ladies say I'm you gIrl, you're my man. Promise to love you the best i can. See I've been there, done it, humped around. After all that - this is what i found. Everyone of ya'll are just like me. It's too bad that you can't see. That you got it bad... hey.

U got it badCome on hold my hand. I wanna contact the living. Not sure I understand. This role I've been given. I sit and talk to God. And he just laughs at my plans. My head speaks a language. I don't understand. I just wanna feel real love. Feel the home that I live in. 'Cause I got too much life. Running through my veins, going to waste. I don't wanna die. But I ain't keen on living either. Before I fall in love. I'm preparing to leave her. I scare myself to death. That's why I keep on running. Before I've arrived. I can see myself coming. I just wanna feel real love. Feel the home that I live in. 'Cause I got too much life. Running through my veins, going to waste. And I need to feel. Real love. And a life ever after. I cannot give it up. I just wanna feel real love. Feel the home that I live in. I got too much love. Running through my veins, to go to waste. I just wanna feel real love. In a life ever after, there's a hole in my soul. You can see it in my face. It's a real big place. Come and hold my hand. I want to contact the living. Not sure I understand. This role I've been given. Not sure I understand. Not sure I understand. Not sure I understand. Not sure I understandNever win first place, I don't support the team.

Takin it in, try to be feminine. With my makeup bag watchin all the sin. Misfit, I sit. Lit up, wicked. Everybody else surrounded by the girls. With the tank tops and the flirty ways. I'm just sippin on chamomile. Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal. With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom. And went to my high school. All the boys say. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. Girls Say, Girls Say. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. Hey Baby Baby. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. Boys Say, Boys Say. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. All the boys get the girls in the back. I'm the one they feed upon. Give a bit a star is born. And if you had enough you'll get the pass. And you can tell your friends how you made it back. No matter what they say I'm still the same. Somehow everybody knows my name. And all the girls wanna get with the boys. And the boys really like it. All the boys say. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. Girls Say, Girls Say. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. Hey Baby Baby. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. Boys Say, Boys Say. Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey. All the boys get the girls in the back. Check it out, it's Bounty Killer, and No Doubt.

When you're lyin' here in my arms. I'm findin' it hard to believe. We're in heaven. And love is all that I need. And I found it there in your heart. It isn't too hard to see. We're in heaven. Oh, thinkin' about all our younger years. There was only you and me. We were young and wild and free. Now nothin' can take you away from me. We've been down that road before. But that's over now. You keep me comin' back for more. Baby you're all that I want. When you're lyin' here in my arms. I'm findin' it hard to believe. We're in heaven. And love is all that I need. And I found it there in your heart. It isn't too hard to see. We're in heaven. Oh, once in your life you find someone. Who will turn your world around. Bring you up when you're feelin' down. Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me. Oh, there's lots that I could say. But just hold me now. 'Cause our love will light the way. Baby you're all that I want. When you're lyin' here in my arms. I'm findin' it hard to believe. We're in heaven. And love is all that I need. And I found it there in your heart. It isn't too hard to see. We're in heaven. I've been waitin' for so long. For somethin' to arrive. For love to come along. Now our dreams are comin' true. Through the good times and the bad. Yeah, I'll be standin' there by you. Baby you're all that I want. When you're lyin' here in my arms. I'm findin' it hard to believe. We're in heaven. And love is all that I need. And I found it there in your heart. It isn't too hard to see. We're in heavenI can't stand to fly. I'm not that naive. I'm just out to find. The better part of me. I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane. I'm more than some pretty face beside a train. And it's not easy to be me. I wish that I could cry. Fall upon my knees. Find a way to lie? Bout a home I'll never see. It may sound absurd but don't be naive. Even heroes have the right to bleed. I may be disturbed but won't you concede. Even heroes have the right to dream?. And it's not easy to be me. Up up and away away from me. Well it's all right. You can all sleep sound tonight. I'm not crazy or anything. I can't stand to fly. I'm not that naive. Men weren't meant to ride. With clouds between their knees. I'm only a man in a silly red sheet. Digging for kryptonite on this one way street. Only a man in a funny red sheet. Looking for special things inside of me. Inside of me, inside of me, yeah. Inside of me, inside of me. I'm only a man in a funny red sheet. I'm only a man looking for a dream. I'm only a man in a funny red sheet. And it's not easy, it's not easy to be meCeline Dion. A New Day Has Come. A New Day Has Come. I was waiting for so long. For a miracle to come. Everyone told me to be strong. Hold on and don't shed a tear. So through darkness and good times. I knew I'd make it through. And the world thought I had it all. But I was waiting for you. Hush now. I see a light in the sky. Oh it's almost blinding me. I can't believe I've been touched by an angel. With love. Let the rain come down. And wash away my tears. Let it fill my soul. And drown my fears. Let it shatter the walls. For a new sun. A new day has come. A new day has come. Where it was dark now there is light. Where there was pain, now there's joy. Where there was weakness, I found my strength. All in the eyes of a boy. Hush now. I see a light in the sky. Oh it's almost blinding me. I can't believe I've been touched by an angel. With love. Let the rain come down. And wash away my tears. Let it fill my soul. And drown my fears. Let it shatter the walls. For a new sun. A new day has come. A new day has comeWhat if I told you it was all meant to be?. Would you believe me?. Would you agree?. It's almost that feeling. We've met before. So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy. When I tell you love has come here and now. A moment like this. Some people wait a lifetime. For a moment like this. Some people search forever. For that one special kiss. Oh I can't believe it's happening to me. Some people wait a lifetime. For a moment. Like this. Everything changes but beauty remains. Something so tender. I can't explain. Well I may be dreaming. But till I awake. Can't we make this dream last forever?. And I'll cherish all the love we share. A moment like this. Some people wait a lifetime. For a moment like this. Some people search forever. For that one special kiss. Oh I can't believe it's happening to me. Some people wait a lifetime. For a moment. Like this. Could this be the greatest love of all?. I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall. So let me tell you this. Some people wait a lifetime for a moment. Like this. Some people wait a lifetime. For a moment like this. Some people search forever. For that one special kiss. Oh I can't believe it's happening to me. Some people wait a lifetime. For a moment. Like this. Oh like this. Oh I can't believe it's happening to me. Some people wait a lifetime. For a moment. Like thisI waited 'til I saw the sun. I don't know why I didn't come. I left you by the house of fun. I don't know why I didn't come. I don't know why I didn't come. When I saw the break of day. I wished that I could fly away. Instead of kneeling in the sand. Catching tear-drops in my hand. My heart is drenched in wine. But you'll be on my mind forever. Out across the endless sea. I will die in ecstasy. But I'll be a vagabond. Driving down the road alone. My heart is drenched in wine. But you'll be on my mind forever. Something has to make you run. I don't know why I didn't come. I feel as empty as a drum. I don't know why I didn't come. I don't know why I didn't come. I don't know why I didn't comeI get up when I'm down. I can't swim but my soul won't drown. I do believe I got flare. I got speed and I walk on air. 'Cause God gimme soul and all rock n roll babe. 'Cause God gimme soul and all rock n roll babe. And I get so high I just can't feel it. And I get so high I just can't feel it. In and out my brain running through my veins.

I can't stay on your life support, there's a shortage in the switch. I can't stay on your morphine, 'cuz its makin' me itch. I said, I tried to call the nurse again but she's being a little bitch. I think I'll get outta here, where I can. Run just as fast as I can. To the middle of nowhere. To the middle of my frustrated fears. And I swear you're just like a pill. Instead of makin' me better, you keep makin' me ill. You keep makin' me ill. I haven't moved from the spot where you left me. This must be a bad trip. All of the other pills, they were different. Maybe I should get some help. I can't stay on your life support, there's a shortage in the switch. I can't stay on your morphine, 'cuz its makin' me itch.

On rainy days, we'd go swimming out. On rainy days, swimming in the sound. On rainy days, we'd go swimming out. You're in my mind all of the time. I know that's not enough. If the sky can crack, there must be some way back. For love and only love. Car alarm won't let you back to sleep. You're kept awake dreaming someone else's dream. Coffee is cold, but it'll get you through. Compromise, that's nothing new to you. Let's see colors that have never been seen. Let's go to places no one else has been. You're in my mind all of the time. I know that's not enough. Well, if the sky can crack, there must be some way back. To love and only love. Electrical storm. Electrical storm. Electrical storm. Baby, don't cry. It's hot as Hell, honey, in this room. Sure hope the weather will break soon. The air is heavy, heavy as a truck. Need the rain to wash away our bad luck. Hey yeah, hey yeah. Well, if the sky can crack. There must be some way back to love and only love. Electrical storm. Electrical storm. Electrical storm. Baby, don't cry. Baby, don't cry. Baby, don't cry.

Oh, I'm gonna getcha good!Where's my snare?. I have no snare on my headphones. There you go, yeah, yo yo. Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?. I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against. Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times. Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind. All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'. Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'. Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'. Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'. Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth. See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out. Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now. Ain't you mama? I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now. I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin out my closet, ha". I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it. So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it. I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73. Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD. I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months. My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch. 'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye. No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die. I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side. Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work wit her. At least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes. But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today. What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb. But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun. 'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both. It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show. I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha". Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition. Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'. But put yourself in my position, just try to envision. Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen. Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'. Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome. My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't. 'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?. Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?. So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?. But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when yaw lonely. And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony. And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful. But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral. See what hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong. Screw this song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom. But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get. You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in Hell for this shit. Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?. Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!. I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you. I Never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet. One more time. I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you cry. But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"Thought that I was going crazy. Just havin' one those days yea. Didn't know what to do. Then there was you. And everything went from wrong to right. And the stars came out to fill up the sky. The music you were playin' really blew my mind. It was love at first sight. 'Cause baby when I heard you. For the first time I knew. We were meant to be as one. I was tired of running out of luck. Thinkin' 'bout giving up, yea. Didn't know what to do. Then there was you. And everything went from wrong to right.

Stand up, once again, we're getting jiggy. Siberia yeah goodbyeIt's not her fault that she's so irresistible. But all the damage she's caused isn't fixable. Every twenty seconds you repeat her name. But when it comes to me you don't care. . Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal. That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible. But you gotta know small things also count. You better put your feet on the ground. And see what it's about. . So objection, I don't wanna be the exception. To get a bit of your attention. I love you for free and I'm not your mother. But you don't even bother. . Objection, I'm tired of this triangle. Got dizzy dancing tango. I'm falling apart in your hands again. No way, I've got to run away. . I wish you. (There was a chance for you and me). I wish. (You couldn't find a place to be). Away from here. . This is pathetic and sardonic, it's sadistic and psychotic. Tango is not for three, was never meant to be. But you can try it, rehearse it or train like a horse. But don't you count on me, don't you count on me boy. . So objection, I don't want to be the exception. To get a bit of your attention. I love you for free and I'm not your mother.

YeahLast day of the rest of my life I wish I would have known cause i'd have kissed my. momma goobye. I didn't tell her that I loved her or how much cared or thank my. pops for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared. Unaware I just did what I. always do. Everyday the same routine before I skate off to school but who knew. that. this day wasnt like the rest, instead of takin the test I took two to the chest.. Call me blind but I didn't see it comin and everybody was runnin but I couldn't. hear nothin, except gun blast, it happened so fast I didn't really know this kid. though I sat by him in class. Maybe this kid was reachin out for love or maybe. for a moment he forgot who he was or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged,. whatever it was I know its because. CHORUS. We are We are the youth of the nation (repeat)x4. Little Suzzy she was only twelve she was given the world with every chance to. excel. Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell she might act kinda proud. but no respect for herself. She finds love in all the wrong places the same situations but different faces.. Changed up her pace since her daddy left her too bad he never told her she. deserved much better.. Johnny boy always played the fool, he broke all the rules so you would think he. was cool.. He was never really one of the guys no matter how hard he tried, with the. thought of suicide. It's kinda hard when you ain't got no friends, he put his life to an end they. might remember him then.. You cross a line and there is no turnin back he told the world how he felt with. the sound of a gat.. CHORUS x4. Whos to blame for the life that tragedies claim no matter what you say it won't. take away the pain, that I feel inside I'm tired of all the lies don't nobody know. why it's the blind leadin the blind.. Guess that's the way that the story goes, will it ever make sense somebody's. gotta. know, there's gotta be more to life than this, there's got to be more to everything. I thought exists. CHORUS to the endWhen you look at me tell me what do you see. This is what you get, it's the way I am. When I look at you I wannabe, I wannabe. Somewhere close to heaven with Neanderthal man. Don't go, I know you want to touch me. Here there and everywhere. Sparks fly when we are together. You can't deny the facts of life. You don't have to act like a star.

Why ain't you asking me to stay. Because tonight I'm gonna give you my. You could be my baby, what's your star sign?. Won't you take a step into the lion's den?.

You have taken my breath away. Ooh, is the world still spinning around. (Spinning around). Ooh, I don't feel like coming down. It's in your eyes. I can tell what you're thinking. My heart is sinking too. It's no surprise. I've been watching you lately. I want to make it with you. Destiny has a funny way. When it comes and takes all your cares away. I can't think of a single thing. Other than what a beautiful state I'm in. Ooh, is the world still spinning around. (Spinning around). Ooh, I don't feel like coming down. It's in your eyes.

(No surprise, no surprise). I've been watching you lately. I want to make it with you. It's in your eyesWhen you get caught in the rain with nowhere to run. When you are distraught and in pain without anyone. When you keep crying out to be saved. But nobody comes and you feel so far away. That you just can't find your way home. You can get there alone it's okay once you say. I can make it through the rain. I can stand up once again. On my own and I know. That I'm strong enough to mend. And everytime I feel afraid. I hold tighter to my faith. And I live one more day. And I make it through the rain. And if you keep falling down. Don't you dare give in. You will arise safe and sound. So keep pressing on steadfastly. And you'll find what you'll need to prevail. Once you say. I can make it through the rain. I can stand up once again. On my own and I know. That I'm strong enough to mend. And everytime I feel afraid. I hold tighter to my faith. And I live one more day. And I make it through the rain. And when the wind blows. And shadows grow close. Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face. And should they tell you. You'll never pull through. Don't hesitate, stand tall and say. I, I can make it through the rain. I can stand up once again. On my own and I know. That I'm strong enough to mend. And everytime I feel afraid. I hold tighter to my faith. And I live one more day. And I make it through the rain. I can make it through the rain. And stand up once again. And I'll live one more day. And I, I can make it through the rain. Oh yes you can. You're gonna make it through the rainSo you leavin' in the mornin'. On the early train. Well I could say, "Everything's all right". And I could pretend and say, "Goodbye". Got your ticket, got your suitcase. Got your leaving smile. Oh, I could say, "That's the way it goes". And I could pretend and you won't know that I was lying. 'Cause I can't stop loving you. No, I can't stop loving you. No, I won't stop loving you. Why should I?. We took a taxi to the station. Not a word was said. And I saw you walk across the road. For maybe the last time, I don't know. Feeling humble, heard a rumble. On the railway track. And when I hear the whistle blow. I'll walk away and you won't know that I'll be crying. 'Cause I can't stop loving you. No, I can't stop loving you. No, I won't stop loving you. Why should I?.   (Even try). I'll always be here by your side.   (Why, why, why?). I never wanted to say goodbye.   (Why even try?). I'm always here if you change, change your mind. So you leavin' in the mornin'. On the early train. Well I could say, "Everything's all right". And I could pretend and say, "Goodbye". But that would be lying. 'Cause I can't stop loving you. No, I can't stop loving you. No, I won't stop loving you. Why should I?. 'Cause I can't stop loving you. No, I can't stop loving you. No, I won't stop loving you. Why should I? Why should I?. Why should I even try?(Verse 1: Truth Hurts). He breaks, me down, he builds, me up. He fills, my cup, I like, it rough. We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall. He comes, in late, but it's, ok. He do, I do, he knows, the rules. He takes care of home, though he's not alone. I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean. And gives, me things, he makes, me scream. (Chorus: Truth Hurts). He's so contagious, he turns my pages. He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for. He keeps me guessin, spontaneous. He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady. (Verse 2: Truth Hurts). Oh! Tonight he's waitin, and I ain't complainin. I'm entertainin, my number one fan. My back is achin, from our love makin. Oh yes I'm takin, ain't no use in fakin. My ups, my downs, my high and my lows. From head to toe, he makes me glow. He hits the spot, he makes me hot. I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I got. (Chorus: Truth Hurts). He's so contagious, he turns my pages. He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for. He keeps me guessin, spontaneous. He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady. (Verse 3: Rakim). Thinkin of a masterplan, you know anything you need baby ask your man. You was there from a half a grand. Now it's kelos to c notes and how fast your grands. We ball like we own the world, your only concern is you my only girl. And when we speakin in tongues. Breathin hard when I'm squeezin your lungs. Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done. It's joy and pain, when you try to get ahead of the game. It's fucked up but you never complain. You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood. Just another hundred mill and I'm a quit for good. No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts.

Said, "I wouldn't walk away", somedays I want to stay. But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay. Never thought it would be true, me livin' without you. But now it's time for me to make that move, oh. I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it. After telling everybody that I wasn't with it. Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it.

Hey DJFor so many years we were friends. And yes, I always knew what we could do. But so many tears in the rain. Felt the night you said. That love had come to you. I thought you were not my kind. I thought that I could never feel for you. The passion and love you were feeling. And so you left for someone new. And now that you're far and away. I'm sending a letter today. From Sarah with love. She'd got the lover she is dreaming of. She never found the words to say. But I know that today. She's gonna send her letter to you. From Sarah with love. She took your picture to the stars above. And they told her it is true. She could dare to fall in love with you. So don't make her blue when she writes to you. From Sarah with love. So maybe the chance for romance. Is like a train to catch before it's gone. Maybe it's just an illusion to hold behind. The clouds you'll find the sun. But I'll keep on hoping and praying. There will be a day when we meet again. And I'll keep on waiting and dreaming. You're strong enough to understand. As long as you're so far away. I'm sending a letter each day. From Sarah with love. She'd got the lover she is dreaming of. She never found the words to say. But I know that today. She's gonna send her letter to you. From Sarah with love. She took your picture to the stars above. And they told her it is true.

And again and again. I know her heart cries out for you. From Sarah with love. She'd got the lover she is dreaming of. Never found the words to say, ahh. But today, but today. From Sarah with love. She took your picture to the stars above. And they told her it is true. She could dare to fall in love with you. So don't make her blue when she writes to you. From Sarah with love.

G-UnitWhat's wrong with the world, mama. People livin' like they ain't got no mamas. I think the whole world's addicted to the drama. Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma. Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism. But we still got terrorists here livin'. In the USA, the big CIA. The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK. But if you only have love for your own race. Then you only leave space to discriminate. And to discriminate only generates hate. And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah. Madness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how anger works and operates. Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight. Take control of your mind and meditate. Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all. People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach?. Or would you turn the other cheek?. Father, Father, Father help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love, the love, the love. It just ain't the same, all ways are changed. New days are strange, is the world insane?. If love and peace is so strong. Why are there pieces of love that don't belong. Nations droppin' bombs. Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones. With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young. So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone. So I can ask myself really what is goin' wrong. In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in. Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends. Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother. A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover. The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug. If you never know truth then you never know love. Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know). Where's the love, y'all(come on yeah). People killin', people dyin'. Children hurt and you hear them cryin'. Can you practice what you preach. Or would you turn the other cheek. Father, Father, Father help us. Send us some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love (Love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love (The love). Where is the love, the love, the love. I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder. As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder. Most of us only care about money makin'. Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction. Wrong information always shown by the media. Negative images, is the main criteria. Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria. Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas. Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity. Whatever happened to the fairness and equality. Instead in spreading love we're spreading animosity. Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under. That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down. There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under. Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found (now ask yourself). Where is the love. Where is the love. Where is the love. Where is the love. Father, Father, Father help us. Send some guidance from above. 'Cause people got me, got me questionin'. Where is the love. Sing with my ya'll. (One world, one world). We only got. (One world, one world). That's all we got. (One world, one world). And somethin's wrong wit it. (Yeah). Somethin's wrong wit it. (Yeah). Somethin's wrong with the w-w-world yeah. We only got. (One world, one world). That's all we got. (One world, one world)Beyonce Knowles. Miscellaneous. Crazy In Love.                 [Intro - Jay Z].

Because I can't forget. Back and forth through my mind. Behind a cigarette. And the message comin' from my eyes says, "Leave it alone.". Don't wanna hear about it. Every single one's got a story to tell. Everyone knows about it. From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell. And if I catch it comin' back my way. I'm gonna serve it to you. That ain't what you want to hear. But that's what I'll do. And the feeling coming from my bones says, "Find a home.". I'm going to Witchita. Far from this opera forevermore. I'm gonna work the straw. Make the sweat drip out of every pore. And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding right before the lord. All the words are gonna bleed from me. And I will think no more. And the stains comin' from my blood tell me, "Go back home."When this began, I had nothing to say. And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me.   (I was confused). And I'd let it all out to find. That I'm not the only person with these things in mind.   (Inside of me). . When all the vacancy the words revealed. Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel.   (Nothing to loose). Just stuck, hollow and alone. And the fault is my own and the fault is my own. . I wanna heal, I wanna feel. What I thought was never real. I want to let go of the pain I felt so long.   (Erase all the pain till it's gone). . I wanna heal, I wanna feel. Like I'm close to something real. I want to find something I've wanted all along. Somewhere I belong. . And I've got nothing to say. I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face.   (I was confused). Looking everywhere only to find. That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind.   (So what am I). . What do I have but negativity. 'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me.   (Nothing to loose). Nothing to gain, hollow and alone. And the fault is my own and the fault is my own. . I wanna heal, I wanna feel. What I thought was never real. I want to let go of the pain I felt so long.   (Erase all the pain 'til it's gone). . I wanna heal, I wanna feel. Like I'm close to something real. I want to find something I've wanted all along. Somewhere I belong. . I will never know myself until I do this on my own. And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed. I will never be anything till I break away from me. I will break away, I'll find myself today. . I wanna heal, I wanna feel. What I thought was never real. I want to let go of the pain I felt so long.   (Erase all the pain till it's gone). . I wanna heal, I wanna feel. Like I'm close to something real. I want to find something I've wanted all along. Somewhere I belong. . I wanna heal. I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong. I wanna heal. I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong.

Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes. . (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow). Every step that I take is another mistake to you. (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow). . I've become so numb I can't feel you there. Become so tired so much more aware. I'm becoming this all I want to do.

YeahThese ideas are nightmares for white parents. Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings. Like whatever they say has no bearin'. Its so scary in a house that allows no swearin'. To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'. Alone in his own zone cold and he don't care. He's a problem child what bothers him all comes out. When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out. 'Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him out. But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out. His thoughts are whacked he's mad so he's talkin' back. Talkin' black brainwashed from rock and rap. He sags his pants two rags and a stockin' cap. His step father hit him so he socked him back. And broke his nose this house is a broken home. There's no control he just lets his emotions go. (C'mon). Sing with me. (Sing). Sing for the year. (Sing). Sing for the laughter. Sing for the tear. (C'mon). Sing with me just for today. Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away. Entertainment is danger intertwine it with gangsters. In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum. Only you're unholy only have one homey. Only this gun lonely 'cuz don't anyone know me. But everybody just feels like they can relate. I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great. Or they can be great or even worse they can teach hate. Its like kids hang on every single statement we make. Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum. Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?. From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'. To havin' a fortune no more kissin' ass. But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you. Fans turn on you attorney's all gonna turn it to. To get their hands on every dime you have. They want you to lose your mind every time you mad. So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon. You need to spew don't hesitate to produce air guns. Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me. Swiftly just to get me off these streets quickly. But all their kids been listen to me religiously. So I'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me. They're for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me. If I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense, Pete. It's all political if my music is literal and I'm a criminal. How the fuck can I raise a little girl?. I couldn't I wouldn't be fit to. You're full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you. Sing with me. (Sing). Sing for the year. (Sing). Sing for the laughter. Sing for the tear. (C'mon). Sing with me just for today. Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away. They say music can alter moods and talk to you. But can it load a gun for you and cock it too?. Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude. Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued. See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols. And they want to get one 'cos they think the shit's cool. Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves. We're entertainers of course this shit's affectin' our sales. You ignoramus but music is reflection of self. We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail. It's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin'. To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted. It's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing. Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine. Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long. Idolize their favorite rappers and know all they songs. Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives. So they sit and they cry at night wishin' they die. Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe. We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes. That's why we seize the moment and try to freeze it and own it. Squeeze it and hold it 'cos we consider these minutes golden. And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone. Just let our spirits live on through out lyrics that you hear in our songs. And we can. Sing with me. (Sing). Sing for the year. (Sing). Sing for the laughter. Sing for the tear. (C'mon). Sing with me just for today. Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away. Sing with me. (Sing). Sing for the year. (Sing). Sing for the laughter. Sing for the tear. (C'mon). Sing with me just for today. Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you awayBaby, baby, baby, from the day I saw you.

Say what am I not supposed to have an opinion?. Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?. Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind. Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled. (ooh...) When a female fires back. (ooh-ooh-ooh...) Suddenly the target don't know how to act. (ooh...) So he does what any little boy would do. (ooh...) Makin' up a few false rumors or two. (ooh...) That for sure is not a man to me. (ooh...) It's slanderin' names for popularity. (ooh...) It's sad you only get your fame through controversy. (it's so sad). (ooh...) But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say. This is for my girls all around the world. Around the world. Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth. Oh-oh ooh. Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard. Oh... oh. What do we do girls?. (shout louder). Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground. Stand our ground. Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud. Oh... ooh. Take a deep breath and say it loud. W-h-o-a. Never can never will.

(ooh-ooh-ooh...) It's a common double standard of society. (ooh...)The guy gets all the glory the more he can score. (ooh...) While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore. (ooh...) I don't understand why it's ok. (ooh...) The guy can get away with it the girl gets named. (ooh...) All my ladies come together and make it change. Start a new beginning for us everybody sang.

He can even give her some head or sex her off. But if a girl do the same she's a whore. But the tables about to turn I bet my fame on it. Cats take my ideas and put they name on it. It's aight though you can't hold me down (hold me). I got to keep on moving. To my girls to their man who be trying to mack. Do it right back to him and let that be that.

Disco dancing with the lights down low. Beats are pumping on the stereo. Neighbours banging on the bathroom wall. Sayin 'crank the bass, I gotta get some more'. Water's running in the wrong direction. Got a feeling it's a mixed-up sign. I can see it in my own reflection. Something funny's going on inside my mind. I don't know what is pushing me higher. It's the static from the floor below. Then its drops and catches like fire. It's the sound I, it's the sound I know. [Chorus]. It's the sound of the underground. The beat of the drum goes round and around. In to the overflow. Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio. Out to the electric night. Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet light. The beat goes around and round. Its the sound of the under, sound of the underground. [Verse 2]. Chain reaction running through my veins. Pumps the bass line up into my brain. Screws my mind until I lose control. And when the building rocks I know its got my soul. Water's running in the wrong direction. Got a feeling it's a mixed-up sign. I can see it in my own reflection. Something funny's going on inside my mind. I don't know what is pushing me higher. It's the static from the floor below. Then its drops and catches like fire. It's the sound I, it's the sound I know. [Chorus]. It's the sound of the underground. The beat of the drum goes round and around. In to the overflow. Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio. Out to the electric night. Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet light. The beat goes around and round. Its the sound of the under, sound of the underground. I don't know what is pushing me higher. It's the static from the floor below. Then its drops and catches like fire. It's the sound I, it's the sound I. It's the sound I, it's the sound I know. [Chorus]. It's the sound of the underground. The beat of the drum goes round and around. In to the overflow. Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio. Out to the electric night. Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet light. The beat goes around and round. Its the sound of the under, sound of the underground. The bass line jumps in the backstreet light. It's the sound of the under, sound of the underground. The bass line jumps in the backstreet light. It's the sound of the under, sound of the undergroundsooooooooo. Got somebody she's a beauty. Very special really and truly.

So watch your step cause if I do you'll need a miracle. You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here. This double vision I was seeing is finally clear. You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone. Not fit to ' tread the ground that I am walking on. When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love.

Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head. You should know better you never listened to a word I said. Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat. Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did. When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love. You'll understand what I mean when I say. There's no way we're gonna give up. And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. Does it kill. Does it burn. Is it painful to learn. That it's me that has all the control. Does it thrill. Does it sting. When you feel what I bring. And you wish that you had me to hold. When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love. You'll understand what I mean when I say. There's no way we're gonna give up. And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe. Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breatheI took my love. And I took it down. I climbed a mountain. And I turned around. And I saw my reflection. in a snow covered hill. Well the Landslide brought me down. Oh mirror in the sky what is love.

And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills. Well maybe... Well maybe... Well maybe. Landslide will bring you down.Lay down, your sweet and weary head. Night's falling, you've come to journeys end. . Sleep now, and dream of the ones who came before. They are calling from across a distant shore. . Why do you weep?. What are these tears upon your face?. Soon you will see all of your fears will pass away. Safe in my arms, you're only sleeping. . What can you see on the horizon?. Why do the white gulls call?. Across the sea a pale moon rises. The ships have come to carry you home. . And all will turn to silver glass. A light on the water, all souls pass. . Hope fades, into the world of night. Through shadows falling out of memory and time. . Don't say, we have come now to the end. White shores are calling. You and I will meet again. And you'll be here in my arms, just sleeping. . What can you see on the horizon?. Why do the white gulls call?. Across the sea a pale moon rises. The ships have come to carry you home. . And all will turn to silver glass. A light on the water, gray ships pass into the westThey say in chess you've got to kill the queen and then you made it. Oh why - do you?. A funny thing the king who gets himself assasinated.

Going by the rules that I've been taught. More understanding of what's around me. And protected from the walls of love. All that you see is me. And all I truly believe. That I was born to try. I've learned to love. Be understanding. And believe in life. But you've got to make choices. Be wrong or right. Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like. But I was born to try.

I wish that you would just leave. Your presence still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time can not erase. When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. You used to captivate me by your resonating light. Now I'm bound by the life you left behind. Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me. These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time can not erase. When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears. And I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone. But though you're still with me. I've been alone all along. When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years. But you still have all of me. Me.... Me...Notice me. Take my hand. Why are we. Strangers when. Our love is strong?. Why carry on without me?. Every time I try to fly I fall. Without my wings. I feel so small. I guess I need you, baby. And every time I see. You in my dreams. I see your face. It's haunting me. I guess I need you, baby. I make-believe. That you are here. It's the only way. I see clear. What have I done?. You seem to move on easy. And every time I try to fly I fall. Without my wings. I feel so small. I guess I need you, baby. And every time I see. You in my dreams. I see your face. You're haunting me. I guess I need you, baby. I may have made it rain. Please, forgive me. My weakness caused you pain. And this song's my sorry. At night I pray. That soon your face will fade away. And every time I try to fly I fall. Without my wings. I feel so small. I guess I need you, baby. And every time I see. You in my dreams. I see your face. You're haunting me. I guess I need you, babyI don't understand why. See it's burning me to hold onto this.

Feel your arms around the world at Christmas time. But say a prayer and pray for the other ones. At Christmas time its hard but while you're having fun. There's a world outside your window and it's a world of dread and fear. Where a kiss of love can kill you. Where there's death in every tear.

See Caroline, all the guys would say she's mighty fine. But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time. And the other half either got you cursed out, or coming up short.

She said "Pardon me, are you ballin'?". I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing". Oh so you're one them freaks. Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt. But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak. Trickin' off this bitch is lost. Must take me for a geek a quick way to eat. A neat place to sleep, a rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat now. Go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless. Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers. And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom.

My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions. Had so many questions that you just kissed away. Tell me, I guess that Cupid was in disguise. The day you walked in and changed my life. I think it's amazing the way that love can set you free. So now I walk in the midday sun. I never thought that my savior would come. I think it's amazing, I think it's amazing. I think you're amazing. You tried to save me from myself. Said, "Darling, kiss as many as you want. My love's still available and I know you're insatiable". We're like a victims of the same disease.

The world feels like it's caved in, proper sorry frown. Please let me show you where we could only just be for us. I can change, and I can grow, or we could adjust. The wicked thing about us is we always have trust. We can even have an open relationship if you must. I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me. But her eyes glaze over, like she's looking straight through me. Her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity. When they open up she's looking down at her feet. Dry your eyes mate. I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up. There's plenty more fish in the sea. Dry your eyes mate. I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts. But you've got to walk away now, it's over. So then I move my hand up and down by my side. It's shaking; my life is crashing before my eyes. I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies. Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh. 'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me. There's things I can't imagine doing. Things I can't imagine seeing. It weren't supposed to be easy, surely. Please, please, I'm begging, please. She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested. She wraps her fingers around mine with the softness she's blessed with. She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures. By pushing my hand away to my chest, from hers. Dry your eyes mate. I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up. There's plenty more fish in the sea. Dry your eyes mate. I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts. But you've got to walk away now, it's over. And I'm just standing there. I can't say a word. Because everything is just gone. I've got nothing. Absolutely nothing. Trying to pull her close out of bear desperation. Put my arms around her, trying to change what she's saying. Pull my head level with hers so that she might engage in. Look in to her eyes to make her listen again. I'm not gonna fucking just fucking leave it all now. 'Cause you said it'd be forever, and that was your vow. And your gonna let our things simply crash and fall down. You're well out of order now, this is well out of town. She pulls away my arms, tightly clamped round her waist. Gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight. Turns around so she's now got her back to my face. Takes one step forward, looks back, then walks away. Dry your eyes mate. I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up. There's plenty more fish in the sea. Dry your eyes mate. I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts. But you've got to walk away now, it's over. I know in the past I've found it hard to say. Telling you things, but not telling straight. But the more I pull on your hand and say. The more you pull away. Dry your eyes mate. I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up. There's plenty more fish in the sea. Dry your eyes mate. I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts. But you've got to walk away nowDo you ever feel like breaking down. Do you ever feel out of place. Like somehow you just don't belong. And no one understands you. Do you ever wanna run away. Do you lock yourself in your room. With the radio on, turned up so loud. That no one hears you screaming. No you don't know what it's like. When nothing feels allright. No you don't know what it's like. To be like me. To be hurt. To feel lost. To be left out in the dark. To be kicked. When you're down. To feel like you've been pushed around. To be on the edge of breaking down. And no one's there to save you. No you don't know what it's like. Welcome to my life. Do you wanna be somebody else. Are you sick of being so left out. Are you desperate to find something more. Before your life is over. Are you stuck inside a world you hate. Are you sick of everyone around. With their big, fake smiles and stupid lies. While deep inside you're bleeding. No you don't know what it's like. When nothing feels allright. No you don't know what it's like. To be like me. To be hurt. To feel lost. To be left out in the dark. To be kicked. When you're down. To feel like you've been pushed around. To be on the edge of breaking down. And no one's there to save you. No you don't know what it's like. Welcome to my life. No one ever lied straight to your face. And no one ever stabbed you in the back. You might think I'm happy. But I'm not gonna be okay. Everybody always get you what you wanted. Never had to work, it was alway there. You don't know what it's like. What it's like. To be hurt. To feel lost. To be left out in the dark. To be kicked.

Unless I try to start again. . I don't want to be the one. The battles always choose. 'Cause inside I realize. That I'm the one confused. . I don't know what's worth fighting for.

I'm breaking the habit tonight. . Clutching my cure. I tightly lock the door. I try to catch my breath again. . I hurt much more. Than anytime before. I had no options left again. . I don't want to be the one. The battles always choose. 'Cause inside I realize. That I'm the one confused. . I don't know what's worth fighting for. Or why I have to scream. I don't know why I instigate. And say what I don't mean. . I don't know how I got this way. I'll never be alright. So I'm breaking the habit. I'm breaking the habit tonight. .

But now I have some clarity. To show you what I mean. . I don't know how I got this way. I'll never be alright. So I'm breaking the habit. I'm breaking the habit. I'm breaking the habit tonightPaint my face in your magazines. Make it look whiter than it seems. Paint me over with your dreams. Shove away my ethnicity. Burn every notion that I may have a flame inside to fight. And say just what is on my mind. Without offending your might. 'Cause this life is too short to live it just for you. But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do?. So say what you want, say what you want. I saw her face outside today. Weather worn, looking all the rage. They took her passion and her gaze and made a poster. Now it's moccasins we sport. We take the culture and contort. Perhaps only to distort what we are hiding. 'Cause this life is too short to live it just for you. But when you feel so powerless what are you gonna do?. But say what you want, say what you want. Hey you, the one the one outside, are you gonna get in, get in. Hey you, the one that don't fit in, how ya, how ya gonna get in. Hey you, the one outside, are you ever gonna get in with your. Broken teeth, broken jaw, broken mojo. Yeah, this life is too short to live it just for you. But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?. 'Cause this life is too short to live it just for you. But when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?Showbiz dinners and the free champagne. Men in suits who think they know it all. No one knows me but they know my name. That's not real to me. Hotel lobby to the aeroplane. Another country but they start to look the same. Watch the world behind a windowpane. That's not real to me. When I see my babies run. When all the madness has been and gone. I'll raise my family and live in peace. Now, that's what's real to me, real to me. Dying flowers in a dressing room. A dangerous time to let your head make up it's own mind. Got me thinking that the spirit's flown. That's not real to me. When I see my babies run. When all the madness has been and gone. I'll raise my family and live in peace. Now, that's what's real to me. Picnics in the garden. Then the children they can play. The first day of the summer and I laze here all the day. And we'll invite the family round. And drink some English tea. Then I raise up my finger and watch football on TV. Yeah, oh, now that's what's real to me. When I see my babies run. When all the madness has been and gone. I'll raise my family and live in peace. Now, that's what real to me, that's.

I've realized. In time. That my eyes. Are not blind. I've seen it, before, I'm takin' back my life. Vodka and a packet of cigarettes. That's all it used to be but now. You're sniffin' on snow when you're feelin' low. Suffocatin' dreams that could have. Maybe for a minute I'd be down with that. But it didn't take long for me to see the light. You swore, you had control of it. When I stepped back you slipped on your support. Umm hmm. You had me. You lost me. You're wasted. You cost me. I don't want you here, messin' with my mind, oh.

Why everybody is tryin' to be. Livin' like a celebrity. Doin' what they see on MTV. Ice is cool but I'm lookin' for more. Simple things is what my heart beats for. Cause that's me. I don't ask for much. Baby. Havin' you is enough. You ain't got to buy nothin'. It's not what I want. Baby, it's you. We don't have to go nowhere. It's not what I want. Baby, it's you. It's not by what you got, I know you got a lot. No matter what you do, you always gettin' hot. It's you... it's you.... Baby, all I want is you, yeah. It don't matter that your car is fly. And your rims are spinnin' on the side. And it don't matter where we go tonight. Cause if I'm with you, I'll be alright. That's cool, but I'm lookin for more. It's your love that my heart beats for. Cause that's me. Don't have to spend a dime. Baby. I just want your time (yeah...). You ain't got to buy nothin'. It's not what I want. Baby, it's you. We don't have to go nowhere (It's not what I want). Baby, it's you. It's not by what you got, I know you got a lot. No matter what you do, you're always gettin hot. It's you...

(it's you)... it's you. Baby (baby) all I want is you, yeah. (Yeah)So I changed huh?. You got a phone, pick it up, call me. How come we don't even talk no more?. And you don't even call no more?. We don't barely keep in touch at all. And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more. And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now. After all the years we been down. Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true. We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you. We were so young, so full of life and vivrance side by side. Wherever you was ridin' I went. So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit. When Ronnie died you was right by my side with a shoulder to cry on. A tissue to wipe my eyes,. And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it. You even had the same type of childhood I did. Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succumb to yours?. And mine I survived it, you ran the streets, I 9 to 5'd it. We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then I blew up. To both yours and mine surprises. Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it. As much as your pride tries to hide it. Your cold to touch it's just like ice. In your eyes is the look of resentment. I can sense it, and I don't like it. How come we don't even talk no more?. And you don't even call no more?. We don't barely keep in touch at all. And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more. And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now. After all the years we been down. Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true. We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you. It was my dream at first to be on spittin' a verse. On my own album with a deal but shit got worse. So I came out I woulda killed a nigga first. Before I let him disrespect me and check me over some worst. Some bitch that I wasn't with I would hit her then quit. But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit. I told you don't get involved wit her, you was smokin' the chron with her. Comin' out of the bar with her stumblin' half drunk. Like y'all was husband and wife or somethin'. But me catchin' her fuckin' other niggers. Must've hurt you pride or somethin'. 'Cuz you went off at the mouth with people like you wanted with me. When all I tried to do was show your bitch was shifty. And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced. You actin' like I ain't ya man and lyin' like she can't be loose. But I am really you friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth. Don't hate the game or the player. The one that is changing is you. How come we don't even talk no more?. And you don't even call no more?. We don't barely keep in touch at all. And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more. And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now. After all the years we been down. Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true. We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you. Its gettin' only at the top 'cuz my homie had to stop. Now we actin' like I gotta live only for the block. And homies in the hood only see me on the tube. So they gossip on the porch get to speakin' all rude. Fools I used to rap with all expect magic. Like my finger get to snappin and 'poof' it just happen. But Proof is just actin' out the part he was thrown. Shady made it so my baby's ain't starvin' at home. See the devil in your grin since the ghetto we been friends. Forever real intelligence thats forever till the end. I keep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lies. Ain't wastin' my times with these snakes in disguise. How come, when you talk its with bitter respite?. And how come, it's my fault for what you did with your life?. And every time I go to hear you and play you look away. We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face. How come we don't even talk no more?. And you don't even call no more?. We don't barely keep in touch at all. And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more. And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now. After all the years we been down. Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true. We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's youYeeah. (Ooh baby). Lil' Flipper. (Ooh baby). My girl Lea. Sunshine, I can call you my baby boy. You can call me your baby girl.

Look, I know you wanna chill wit a player. But all you got to do is keep it real wit a player. Just answer your phone whenever I call. 'Coz I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball.

Sunshine, I can call you my baby boy. You can call me your baby girl. Maybe we can spend some time. I can be your sunshine. I can call you my baby boy. You can call me your baby girl. Maybe we can spend some time. I can be your sunshine. We don't have to be in love, we can just be friends. I will be right there, beginning to the end. I can bring my girls, you can bring your friends. We can both have fun, don't want this stuff to end. They say love is pain and pain is love. I know ya momma mad 'coz you talk to a thug. You think you know my type but you ain't got no clue. About what a real nigga like me do. I like to stack my bread and flip my chips. And I can change ya life if ya get wit Flip. I take private jets to Vegas, man. It's twenty bread each pick 'coz I'm major man. We can cruise the world in a Bentley Azure. But don't worry, the chauffeur open the door.

We don't have to be in loveI remember all my life. Raining down as cold as ice. shadows of a man. A face through a window. Crying in the night. The night goes into. Morning, just another day. Happy people pass my way. Looking in their eyes. I see a memory. I never realized. how happy you made me oh Mandy. Well you came and you gave without taking. but I sent you away, oh Mandy. well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you today, oh Mandy. I'm standing on the edge of time. I've walked away when love was mine. Caught up in a world of uphill climbing. The tears are in my mind. And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy. Well you came and you gave without taking. but I sent you away, oh Mandy. well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you today, oh Mandy. Yesterday's a dream I face the morning. Crying on a breeze. the pain is calling, oh Mandy. Well you came and you gave without taking. but I sent you away, oh Mandy. well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you today, oh Mandy. You came and you gave without taking. but I sent you away, oh Mandy. You kissed me and stopped me from shaking. And I need you. Oh Mandy won't you listen to what I've got to say. Oh baby don't you let me throw it all away. Oh Mandy won't you listen to what I've got to say. and I need you today oh Mandy...When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary. When troubles come and my heart burdened be. Then I am still and wait here in the silence. Until you come and sit awhile with me. You raise me up so I can stand on mountains. You raise me up to walk on stormy seas. I am strong when I am on your shoulders. You raise me up to more than I can be. You raise me up so I can stand on mountains. You raise me up to walk on stormy seas.

What about the world today?. What about the place that we call home?. We never been so many. And we never been so alone. Keep watching from your picket fence. You keep talking but it makes no sense. You say we're not responsible. We are, we are. You wash your hands, you come out clean. You fail to recognize the enemies within. You say we're not responsible. We are, we are, we are. One step forward, making two steps back, my, oh, my. Riding piggy on the bad boys' back for life. Lining up for the grand illusion. No answers for no questions asked. Lining up for the execution without knowing why. Keep watching from your picket fence. You keep talking but it makes no sense. You say we're not responsible. But we are, we are. You wash your hands, you come out clean. You fail to recognize the enemies within. You say we're not responsible. But we are, we are. It's all about power by taking control.

Watchin' in slow motion as you turn around and say, "My love. Take my breath away. Take my breath away". Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love. Never hesitating to become the fated ones, oh yeah. Turnin' and returnin' to some secret place inside. Watchin' in slow motion as you turn around and say, "My love. Take my breath away. Take my breath away, oh yeah". Through the hourglass I saw you. In time you slipped away. When the mirror crashed I called you. And turned to hear you say. â€½If only for today I am unafraidâ€. Take my breath away. You take my breath away.   (Take my breath away). You take my breath. You take my breath. You take my breath away.   (Take my breath away). You take my breath away.

Bobby Womack's on the radio. Singing to me. "If you think you're lonely now". Wait a minute, this is too deep(too deep). I gotta change the station. So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break. And then I hear Babyface. "I only think of you". And its' breakin' my heart. I'm tryin' to keep it together. But I'm falling apart. I'm feeling all out of my element. Throwing things, crying tryin'. To figure out where the hell I went wrong. The pain reflected in this song. Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside. I need you, need you back in my life baby. When you left I lost a part of me. It's still so hard to believe. Come back, baby, please,'cause. We belong together. Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough. Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up. Who's gonna take your place. There ain't nobody better. Oh baby baby. We belong together. When you left I lost a part of me. It's still so hard to believe. Come back, baby, please,'cause. We belong together. Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough. Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up. Who's gonna take your place. There ain't nobody better. Oh baby baby. We belong togetherWhere is the moment we needed the most. You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost. They tell me your blue skies fade to grey. They tell me your passion's gone away. And I don't need no carryin' on. You stand in the line just ahead of the law. You're faking a smile with the coffee you go. You tell me your life's been way off line. You're falling to pieces everytime. And I don't need no carryin' on. Cause you had a bad day. You're taking one down. You sing a sad song just to turn it around. You say you don't know. You tell me don't lie. You work at a smile and you go for a ride. You had a bad day. The camera don't lie. You're coming back down and you really don't mind. You had a bad day. You had a bad day. Well you need a blue sky holiday. The point is they laugh at what you say. And I don't need no carryin' on. You had a bad day. You're taking one down. You sing a sad song just to turn it around. You say you don't know. You tell me don't lie. You work at a smile and you go for a ride. You had a bad day. The camera don't lie. You're coming back down and you really don't mind. You had a bad day. (Oh. Holiday.). Sometimes the system goes on the blink. And the whole thing turns out wrong. You might not make it back and you know. That you could be well oh that strong. And I'm not wrong. So where is the passion when you need it the most. Oh you and I. You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost. Cause you had a bad day. You're taking one down. You sing a sad song just to turn it around. You say you don't know. You tell me don't lie. You work at a smile and you go for a ride. You had a bad day. You've seen what you like. And how does it feel for one more time. You had a bad day. You had a bad day. Had a bad day. Had a bad dayI walk a lonely road. The only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes. But it's home to me, and I walk alone. I walk this empty street. On the boulevard of broken dreams. Where the city sleeps. And I'm the only one, and I walk alone. I walk alone, I walk alone. I walk alone, I walk a-. My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating. Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me. 'Til then I walk alone. I'm walking down the line. That divides me somewhere in my mind. On the border line. Of the edge and where I walk alone. Read between the lines. "What's fucked up?" and "Everything's all right". Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive. And I walk alone. I walk alone, I walk alone. I walk alone, I walk a-. My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating. Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me. 'Til then I walk alone. I walk alone, I walk a-. I walk this empty street. On the boulevard of broken dreams. Where the city sleeps. And I'm the only one and I walk a-. My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating.

The innocent can never last. Wake me up when September ends. Like my father's come to pass. Seven years has gone so fast. Wake me up when September ends. Here comes the rain again. Falling from the stars. Drenched in my pain again. Becoming who we are. As my memory rests. But never forgets what I lost. Wake me up when September ends. Summer has come and passed. The innocent can never last. Wake me up when September ends. Ring out the bells again. Like we did when spring began. Wake me up when September ends. Here comes the rain again. Falling from the stars. Drenched in my pain again. Becoming who we are. As my memory rests. But never forgets what I lost. Wake me up when September ends. Summer has come and passed. The innocent can never last. Wake me up when September ends. Like my father's come to pass. Twenty years has gone so fast. Wake me up when September ends. Wake me up when September ends. Wake me up when September endsNow it seems to me. That you know just what to say. But words are only words. Can you show me something else?. Can you swear to me. That you'll always be this way?. Show me how you feel. More than ever baby. I don't wanna be lonely no more. I don't wanna have to pay for this. I don't want to know the lover at my door. Is just another heartache on my list. And I don't wanna be angry no more. You know I could never stand for this. So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure. I don't want to be lonely anymore. Now it's hard for me. With my heart still on the mend. Open up to me. Like you do your girlfriends. And you sing to me and it's harmony. Girl, what you do to me is everything. Make me say anything just to get you back again. Why can't we just try?. I don't wanna be lonely no more. I don't wanna have to pay for this. I don't want to know the lover at my door. Is just another heartache on my list. I don't wanna be angry no more. You know I could never stand for this. So when you tell me that you love me know for sure. I don't want to be lonely anymore. What if I was good to you? What if you were good to me?. What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me?. What if it was paradise? And what if we were symphonies?. What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you?. I don't wanna be lonely no more. I don't wanna have to pay for this. I don't want to know the lover at my door. Is just another heartache on my list. I don't wanna be angry no more. But you know I could never stand for this. So when you tell me that you love me know for sure. I don't want to be lonely anymore. I don't wanna be lonely anymore. I don't wanna be lonely no more. I don't wanna be lonely no more. I don't wanna be lonely anymorePrecious and fragile things. Need special handling. My God what have we done to you?. . We always tried to share. The tenderest of care. Now look what we have put you through. . Things get damaged, things get broken. I thought we'd manage, but words left unspoken. Left us so brittle. There was so little left to give. . Angels with silver wings. Shouldn't know suffering. I wish I could take the pain for you. . If God has a master plan. That only He understands. I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through. . Things get damaged, things get broken. I thought we'd manage, but words left unspoken. Left us so brittle. There was so little left to give. . I pray you learn to trust. Have faith in both of us. And keep room in your hearts for two. . Things get damaged, things get broken. I thought we'd manage, but words left unspoken. Left us so brittle. There was so little left to giveLook at this photograph. Every time I do it makes me laugh. How did our eyes get so red?. And what the hell is on Joey's head?. And this is where I grew up. I think the present owner fixed it up. I never knew we'd ever went without. The second floor is hard for sneaking out. And this is where I went to school. Most of the time had better things to do. Criminal record says I've broke in twice. I must have done it half a dozen times. I wonder if it's too late. Should I go back and try to graduate?. Life's better now than it was back then. If I was them I wouldn't let me in. Oh oh oh. Oh God I. Every memory of looking out the back door. I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door. I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. Remember the old arcade. Blew every dollar that we ever made. The cops hated us hanging out. They said somebody went and burned it down. We used to listen to the radio. And sing along with every song we know. We said someday we'd find out how if feels. To sing to more than just the steering wheel. Kim's the first girl I kissed. I was so nervous that I nearly missed. She's had a couple of kids since then. I haven't seen her since God knows when. Oh oh oh. Oh God I. Every memory of looking out the back door. I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door. I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. I miss that town. I miss their faces. You can't erase. You can't replace it. I miss it now. I can't believe it. So hard to stay. So hard to leave it. If I could I relive those days. I know the one thing that would never change. Every memory of looking out the back door. I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. Every memory of walking out the front door. I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for. It's hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye. Look at this photograph. Every time I do it makes me laugh. Every time I do it makes me(Don't hold back). 'Cuz you woke up in the morning. With initiative to move. So why make it harder. (Don't hold back). If you think about it. So many people do. Be cool man, look smarter. (Don't hold back). And you shouldn't even care. About the losers in the air. And their crooked stares. (Don't hold back). 'Cuz there's a party over here. So you might as well be here. Where the people care. The world is holding back. The time has come to. The world is holding back. The time has come to. The world is holding back. The time has come to galvanize. (Don't hold back). If you think about it too much. You may stumble. trip up fall on your face. (Don't hold back). You think it is time. You get up fresh style. Like a sit-up come on keep pace. (Don't hold back). Put apprehension on the back burner. Let it sit, don't even get it lit. (Don't hold back). Get involved with the jam. Don't be a prick, hot chick. (Don't hold back). The world, the world. The time has come to. Push the button. The world, the time. Has come to push the button. The world, the time. Has come to push the button, the world. My finger is on the button. My finger is on the button. My finger is on the button. Push the button. The time has come to galvanizeTough, you think you've got the stuff. You're telling me and anyone. You're hard enough. You don't have to put up a fight. You don't have to always be right. Let me take some of the punches. For you tonight. Listen to me now. I need to let you know. You don't have to go it alone. And it's you when I look in the mirror. And it's you when I don't pick up the phone. Sometimes you can't make it on your own. We fight all the time. You and I that's alright. We're the same soul. I don't need, I don't need to hear you say. That if we weren't so alike. You'd like me a whole lot more. Listen to me now. I need to let you know. You don't have to go it alone. And it's you when I look in the mirror. And it's you when I don't pick up the phone. Sometimes you can't make it on your own. I know that we don't talk. I'm sick of it all. Can you hear me when I sing?. You're the reason I sing. You're the reason why the opera is in me. Hey now. Still gotta let you know. A house does not make a home. Don't leave me here alone. And it's you when I look in the mirror. And it's you that makes it hard to let go. Sometimes you can't make it on your own. Sometimes you can't make it. The best you can do is to fake it. Sometimes you can't make it on your ownWhy you wanna tell me how to live my life?. Who are you to tell me if it's black or white?. Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand. Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?. My daddy lived a lie, it's just the price that he paid. Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away. Ooh, if there's one thing I hang onto. That gets me through the night. I ain't gonna do what I don't want to. I'm gonna live my life. Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice. Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly. When the world gets in my face. I say, have a nice day. Have a nice day. Take a look around you, nothing's what it seems. We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams. Let me be the first to shake a helping hand. Anybody brave enough to take a stand. I knocked on every door down every dead end street. Looking for forgiveness and what's left to believe?. Ooh, if there's one thing I hang onto. That gets me through the night. I ain't gonna do what I don't want to. I'm gonna live my life. Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice. Standing on the ledge, and show the wind how to fly. When the world gets in my face. I say, have a nice day. Have a nice day. Ooh, if there's one thing I hang onto. That gets me through the night. I ain't gonna do what I don't want to. I'm gonna live my life. Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice. Standing on the ledge, and show the wind how to fly. When the world gets in my face. I say, have a nice day. Have a nice day, have a nice day. When the world keeps trying, to drag me down. I've gotta raise my hands, gonna stand my ground. I say, hey, have a nice day. Have a nice day. have a nice dayStep by step, heart to heart. Left right left, we all fall down. Step by step, heart to heart, left right left. We all fall down like toy soldiers. Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win. But the battle wages on for toy soldiers. I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure. Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders. I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it. Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter. I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless. I absolutely have to I'm supposed to set an example. I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em. If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em. That Ja crap I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it. There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it. I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it. It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and nas shit. And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it. I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted. And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it. This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it. That was never my object for someone to get killed. Why would I wanna destroy something I help build. It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good. I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'. Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth. And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about. Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef. So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth. While he's all over TV yeah I'm talkin' a man who literally saved my life. Like fuck it I understand this is business. And this shit just isn't none of my business. But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause. Step by step, heart to heart, left right left. We all fall down like toy soldiers. Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win. But the battle wages on for toy soldiers. There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme. And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'. But now it's elevated 'cuz once you put someone's kids in it. The shlit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?. It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'. We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'. Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him. And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him. Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him. fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it. Mean while my attention is pullin' in another direction. Some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk. Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection. Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record. But now he's fucked the game up 'cuz one of the ways I came up. Was through that publication the same one that made me famous. Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'. Well fuck it, that mother fucker can get it too, fuck him then. But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think. That we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc. And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind. We still have soldiers that's on the front line. That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders. Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us. We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a. To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is. To have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners. Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is. But I ain't try'na have none of my people hurt or murdered. It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it. Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict. I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further. But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'. I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'. Off at your jaws well then I can 'cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'. I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cuz. Step by step, heart to heart, left right left. We all fall down like toy soldiers. Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win. But the battle wages on for toy soldiersIt's coming up, it's coming up. It's coming up, it's coming up. It's coming up, it's coming up. It's dare. It's dare. You've got to press it on you. You just think it. That's what you do baby. Hold it down dare. Jump with them all and move it. Jump back and forth. And feel like you were dare yourself. To work it out.

Coming down like an Armageddon flame (hey!). The shame, the ones who died without a name. Hear the dogs howling out of key. To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (hey!). And bleed, the company lost the war today. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. On holiday. Hear the drum pounding out of time. Another protester has crossed the line (hey!). To find the money's on the other side. Can I get another amen? (amen!). There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (hey!). A gag, a plastic bag on a monument. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. On holiday (hey!). Three, four. The representative from California has the floor. "Sieg Heil" to the president Gasman. Bombs away is your punishment. Pulverize the Eiffel towers. Who criticize your government. "Bang, bang" goes the broken glass and. Kill all the fags that don't agree. Trials by fire, setting fire. Is not a way that's meant for me. Just 'cause (hey, hey). Just 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. This is our lives on holidayYa, let's take em back, uh huh. Comin' up I was confused, my mommy kissin' a girl. Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world. Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies. My favorite rapper used to sing, 'Check, Check Out My Melody'. I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope. Fo' a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes. Nana told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat. If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd be dope. Tossed and turned in my sleep that night. Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike. Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood. I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could. Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top. And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop. Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP. And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me. Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top. And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop. Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP. And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me. On the grill of my lowrider. Guns on both sides right above the gold wires. I'll fo-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song, and really do it. That's the true meanin' of a ghost rider. Ten G's will take ya daughter out of Air Forces. Believe you me, homie, I know all 'bout losses. I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious. One phone call'll have ya body dumped in marshes. I stay strapped like car seats. Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys. That's ten years I told Pooh in ninety-five. I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s. Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride. And if I gotta die, I'd rather a homicide. I ain't have fifty cent when my Grandmomma died. Now I'm goin' back to Cali with my Jacob boy, see how time fly?. Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top. And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop. Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP. And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me. Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top. And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop. Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP. And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me. From the beginnin' to the end, losers lose, winners win. This is real we ain't got to pretend. The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain. Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game. Used to see five-oh throw the crack by the bench. Now I'm fuckin' with five-oh, it's all startin' to make sense. My ma's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent. And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz. Waitin' on shop money to lamp, sittin' in the Range. Thinkin' how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes. When there's kids starvin'. 'Pac is gone and Brenda still throwin' babies in the garbage. I wanna know 'What's Goin' On' like I hear Marvin. No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins. Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted. I think what if Marie Bank had got that abortion? I love you, ma. Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top. And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop. Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP. And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me. Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top. And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop. Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP. And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know meIt's hard to remember how it felt before. Now I found the love of my life. Passes things, get more comfortable. Everything is going right. And after all the obstacles. It's good to see you now with someone else. And it's such a miracle that. You and me are still good friends. After all that we've been through. I know we're cool. I know we're cool. We used to think it was impossible. Now you call me by my new last name. Memories seem like so long ago. Time always kills the pain. Remember Harbor Boulevard. The dreaming days where the mess was made. Look how all the kids have grown, oh. We have changed but we're still the same. After all that we've been through. I know we're cool. I know we're cool. Yeah, I know we're cool. And I'll be happy for you. If you can be happy for me. Circles and triangles. And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend. So far from where we've been. I know we're cool. I know we're cool. C-cool, uh uh. I know we're cool, uh uh. Yeah, I know we're cool. C-cool, yeah. I know we're cool, yeahOh well I woke up tonight and said I.

Yeah!Hit 'em with a little Ghetto Gospel. Those who wish to follow me. (My Ghetto Gospel). I welcome with my hands. And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold. And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns. If I could recollect before my hood days. I'd sit and remanence thinkin' of bliss of the good days. I stop and stare at the younger my heart goes to em. Aids tested it was stress that they under. And nowadays things change. Everyone's ashamed of the youth. 'Cuz the truth look strange and for me it's reversed. We left them a world that's cursed and it hurts. 'Cuz any day they'll push the button and all good men. Like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothin'. Told 'em they could get teary the world looks dreary. When you wipe your eyes see it clearly. There's no need for you to fear me. If you take your time to hear me. Maybe you can learn to cheer me it ain't about black or white. 'Cuz we're human I hope we see the light before it's ruined. My Ghetto Gospel. Those who wish to follow me. (Ghetto Gospel). I welcome with my hands. And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold. And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns. Tell me do you see that old lady, ain't it sad?. Livin' outta bags but she's glad for the little things she has. And over there there's a lady crack got her crazy. Yet she's givin' birth to a baby. I don't trip and let it fade me from outta the frying pan. We jump into another form of slavery. Even now I get discouraged wonder if they take it all back. Will I still keep the courage?. I refuse to be a role model I set goals, stay in control. Drink out my own bottles I made mistakes. But learned from every one and when it's said and done. I bet this brother be a better one. If I upset you don't stress never forget. That God hasn't finished with me yet. I feel His hand on my brain when I write rhymes. I go blind and let the Lord do His thing. But am I less holy 'cuz I chose to puff a blunt. And drink a beer with my homies. Before we find world peace we gotta find peace. And end the war in the streets my Ghetto Gospel. Those who wish to follow me. (Yeah, Ghetto Gospel). I welcome with my hands. And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold. And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns.

What goes around comes around?. What goes up must come down?. Now who's cryin', desirin', to come back. I remember when I was sittin' home alone. Waitin' for you til three o'clock in the 'morn. And when you came home you'd always have some sorry excuse. Half explaining to me like I'm just some kind of a fool. I sacrificed the things I wanted just to do things for you. But when it's time to do for me. You never come through. Now you wanna be up under me. Now you have so much to say to me. Now you wanna make time for me. Whatcha doin' to me, you're confusin' me.

What goes around comes around?. What goes up must come down?. Gotta stop trying to come back to me. What goes around comes around?. What goes up must come down?.

I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what daddy always tell you?. Straighten up little soldier. Stiffen up that upper lip. What you crying about?. You got me. Hailie, I know you miss your mom. And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone. But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had. I can see you're sad. Even when you smile. Even when you laugh. I can see it in your eyes. Deep inside, you wanna cry. 'Cause you're scared. I ain't there?. Daddy's with you in your prayers. No more crying. Wipe them tears. Daddy's here. No more nightmares. We gonna pull together through it. We gon' do it. Laney, uncle's crazy ain't he?. Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it. We're all we got in this world. When it spins. When it swirls. When it whirls. When it twirls. Two little beautiful girls. Looking puzzled, in a daze. I know it's confusing you. Daddy's always on the move. Mama's always on the news. I try to keep you sheltered from it. But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that. The more it backfires on me. All the things, growing up. As daddy that he had to see. Daddy don't want you to see. But you see just as much as he did. We did not plan it to be this way. Your mother and me. But things have got so bad between us. I don't see us ever being together ever again. Like we used to be when was teenagers. But then of course. Everything always happens for a reason. I guess it was never meant to be. But it's just something. We have no control over. And that's what destiny is. But no more worries. Rest your head and go to sleep. Maybe one day we'll wake up. And this will all just be a dream. Now hush little baby don't you cry. Everythings gonna be alright. Stiffen that upper lip up little lady. I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya. Through the night. I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why. We feel how we feel inside. It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby. But I promise, Mama's gonna be alright. It's funny. I remember back one year when daddy had no money. Mommy wrapped the Christamas presents up. And stuck them under the tree. And said some of them were from me. 'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em. I'll never forget that Christmas. I sat up the whole night cryin'. 'Cause daddy felt like a bum. See daddy had a job. But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom. And at the time, every house that we lived in. Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block. And your mom, was saving money. For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you. So you can go to college. Almost had a thousand dollars. 'Till someone broke in and stole it. And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart. And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart. Mom and dad was arguing a lot. So mama moved back on the Chalmers in the flat. One bedroom apartment. And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra. And that's when daddy went to California with his CD. And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me. But daddy had to work. You and mama had to leave me. Then you started seeing daddy on the TV. And mama didn't like it. And you and Laney were too young to understand it. Papa was a rolling stone. Mama developed a habit. And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it. I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand. 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud. Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'. Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out. To see how much you both have grown. It's almost like your sisters now. Wow, I guess you pretty much are. And daddy's still here. Laney I'm talking to you too. Daddy's still here. I like the sound of that, yeah. It's got a ring to it, don't it?. Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment. Now hush little baby don't you cry. Everythings gonna be alright. Stiffen that upper lip up little lady. I told ya daddy's here to hold ya. Through the night. I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why. We feel how we feel inside. It may seem a little crazy pretty baby. But I promise. Mama's gonna be alright. And if you ask me to. Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird. I'mma give you the world. I'mma buy a diamond ring for you. I'mma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile. And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine. I'mma break that birdy's neck. I'll go back to the jewler who sold it to ya. And make him eat every karat. Don't fuck with dad, hahaThere's people talking. They talk about me. They know my name. They think they know everything. But they don't know anything. About me. Give me a dance floor. Give me a dj. Play me a record. Forget what they say. Cause I need to go. Need to getaway tonight. I put my makeup on a Saturday night. I try to make it happen. Try to make it all right. I know I make mistakes. I'm living life day to day. It's never really easy but it's ok. Wake Up Wake Up. On a Saturday night. Could be New York.

Tonight. Tonight. Yeah, tonightI know there's something in the wake of your smile.. I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea.. You've built a love but that love falls apart.. Your little piece of heaven turns too dark.. Listen to your heart. when he's calling for you.. Listen to your heart. there's nothing else you can do.. I don't know where you're going. and I don't know why,. but listen to your heart. before you tell him goodbye.. Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile.. The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea.. They're swept away and nothing is what is seems,. the feeling of belonging to your dreams.. Listen to your heart. when he's calling for you.. Listen to your heart. there's nothing else you can do.. I don't know where you're going. and I don't know why,. but listen to your heart. before you tell him goodbye.. And there are voices. that want to be heard.. So much to mention. but you can't find the words.. The scent of magic,. the beauty that's been. when love was wilder than the wind.. Listen to your heart. when he's calling for you.. Listen to your heart. there's nothing else you can do.. I don't know where you're going. and I don't know why,. but listen to your heart. before you tell him goodbye.. Listen to your heart, mm-mmmmmm. I don't know where you're going. and I don't know why,. but listen to your heart. before you tell him goodbye.I don't need to be anything other. Than a prison guard's son. I don't need to be anything other. Than a specialist's son. I don't have to be anyone other. Than the birth of two souls in one. Part of where I'm going, is knowing where I'm coming from. I don't want to be. Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately. All I have to do. Is think of me and I have peace of mind. I'm tired of looking 'round rooms. Wondering what I've got to do. Or who I'm supposed to be. I don't want to be anything other than me. I'm surrounded by liars. Everywhere I turn. I'm surrounded by imposters. Everywhere I turn. I'm surrounded by identity crisis. Everywhere I turn. Am I the only one who noticed? I can't be the only one who's learned. I don't want to be. Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately. All I have to do. Is think of me and I have peace of mind. I'm tired of looking 'round rooms. Wondering what I've got to do. Or who I'm supposed to be. I don't want to be anything other than me. Can I have everyone's attention please?. If you're not like this and that, you're gonna have to leave. I came from the mountain. The crust of creation. My whole situation-made from clay to stone. And now I'm telling everybody. I don't want to be. Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately. All I have to do. Is think of me and I have peace of mind.

I guess it's right, it's so amazing. Every time I see you I'm alive. You're all I've got. You lift me up. The sun and the moonlight. All my dreams are in your eyes. And I wanna be inside your heaven. Take me to the place you cry from. Where the storm blows your way. And I wanna be the earth that holds you. Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind. I wanna be inside your heaven. When we touch. When we love. The stars light up. The wrong becomes undone. Naturally. My soul surrenders. The sun and the moonlight. All my dreams are in your eyes. And I wanna be inside your heaven. Take me to the place you cry from. Where the storm blows your way. And I wanna be the earth that holds you. Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind. I wanna be inside your heaven. When minutes turn to days and years. If mountains fall, I'll still be here. Holding you until the day I die. I wanna be inside your heaven. Take me to the place you cry from. Where the storm blows your way. (And I wanna be inside in your heaven). I wanna be inside. Where the storm blows your way. And I wanna be inside your heaven. Take me to the place you cry from. Where the storm blows your way. And I wanna be the earth that holds you. Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothing wind. I wanna be inside your heavenWell I was sitting, waiting, wishing. You believed in superstitions. Then maybe you'd see the signs. Lord knows that this world is cruel. And I ain't the Lord no I'm just a fool. And a loving somebody don't make them love you. Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?. Must I always be playing, playing your fool?. I sang your songs, I danced your dance. I gave your friends all a chance. Putting up with them wasn't worth never having you. Aw, maybe you've been through this before. But it's my first time so please ignore. The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you. I can't always be waiting, waiting on you. I can't always be playing, playing your fool. I keep playing your part. But it's not my scene. Want this plot to twist. I've had enough mystery. Keep building it up. But then you're shooting me down. But I'm already down. Just wait a minute. Just sitting, waiting. Just wait a minute. Just sitting, waiting. Well if I was in your position. I'd put down all my ammunition. I'd wonder why it had taken me so long. But Lord knows that I'm not you. And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel. Because waiting on love ain't so easy to do. Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?. Must I always be playing, playing your fool?. No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you. I can't always be playing, playing your fool, foolThis is how we do. We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club. This is how we do. Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love.

Cause that's just who I am this week. Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum. I'm just a notch in your bedpost. But you're just a line in a song. Drop a heart, break a name. We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team. We're going down, down in an earlier round. And Sugar, we're going down swinging. I'll be your number one with a bullet. A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it. We're going down, down in an earlier round. And Sugar, we're going down swinging. I'll be your number one with a bullet.

Right in the thick of love. At times we get sick of love. It seems like we argue everyday. I know i misbehaved. And you made your mistakes. And we both still got room left to grow. And though love sometimes hurts. I still put you first. And we'll make this thing work. But I think we should take it slow. We're just ordinary people. We don't know which way to go. Cuz we're ordinary people. Maybe we should take it slow. This time we'll take it slow. This time we'll take it slow. This ain't a movie no. No fairy tale conclusion ya'll. It gets more confusing everyday. Sometimes it's heaven sent. Then we head back to hell again. We kiss then we make up on the way. I hang up you call. We rise and we fall. And we feel like just walking away. As our love advances. We take second chances. Though it's not a fantasy. I Still want you to stay. We're just ordinary people. We don't know which way to go. Cuz we're ordinary people. Maybe we should take it slow. This time we'll take it slow. This time we'll take it slow. Take it slow. Maybe we'll live and learn. Maybe we'll crash and burn. Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, maybe you'll return. Maybe another fight. Maybe we won't survive. But maybe we'll grow. We never know baby you and I. We're just ordinary people. We don't know which way to go. Cuz we're ordinary people. Maybe we should take it slow (Heyyy). We're just ordinary people. We don't know which way to go. Cuz we're ordinary people.

And the tears come streaming down your face. When you lose something you can't replace. When you love someone, but it goes to waste. Could it be worse?. Lights will guide you home. And ignite your bones. And I will try to fix you. High up above or down below. When you're too in love to let it go. But if you never try you'll never know. Just what you're worth. Lights will guide you home. And ignite your bones. I will try to fix you. Tears stream down your face. When you lose something you cannot replace. Tears stream down your face. And I.

Just please understand, when I see you clap your hands. If you stick around I'm sure that I'll be fine. But I don't feel like dancin'. When the old Joanna plays. My heart could take a chance.

To see a marching band. He said, "Son, when you grow up. Would you be the saviour of the broken. The beaten and the damned?". He said, "Will you defeat them. Your demons, and all the non-believers. The plans that they have made?". "Because one day I'll leave you. A phantom to lead you in the summer. To join The Black Parade". When I was a young boy. My father took me into the city. To see a marching band. He said, "Son, when you grow up. Would you be the saviour of the broken. The beaten and the damned?". Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me. And other times I feel like I should go. And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets. And when you're gone, we want you all to know. We'll carry on. We'll carry on. And though you're dead and gone believe me. Your memory will carry on. You'll carry on. And in my heart I can't contain it. The anthem won't explain it.

To carry on. We'll carry on. And though you're dead and gone believe me. Your memory will carry on. We'll carry on. And though you're broken and defeated. Your weary widow marches. On and on we carry through the fears. Oh, oh, oh. Disappointed faces of your peers. Oh, oh, oh. Take a look at me cause I could not care at all. Do or die, you'll never make me. Because the world will never take my heart. Go and try, you'll never break me. We want it all, we wanna play this part. I won't explain or say I'm sorry. I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar. Give a cheer for all the broken. Listen here, because it's who we are. I'm just a man, I'm not a hero. Just a boy, who had to sing this song. I'm just a man, I'm not a hero. I don't care. We'll carry on. We'll carry on. And though you're dead and gone believe me. Your memory will carry on. You'll carry on. And though you're broken and defeated. Your weary widow marches on. Do or die, you'll never make me. Because the world will never take my heart. Go and try, you'll never break me. We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on). Do or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on). Because the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on). Go and try, you'll never break me (We'll carry).

In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air. I was born too late to a world that doesn't care. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. When the head of state didn't play guitar. Not everybody drove a car. When music really mattered and when radio was king. When accountants didn't have control. And the media couldn't buy your soul. And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air. I was born too late to a world that doesn't care. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. When pop stars still remained a myth. And ignorance could still be bliss. And when God Save the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale. When my mom and dad were in their teens. And anarchy was still a dream. And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air. I was born too late to a world that doesn't care. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. When record shops were on top. And vinyl was all that they stocked. And the super info-highway was still drifting out in space. Kids were wearing hand-me-downs. And playing games meant kick arounds. And footballers who had long hair and dirt across their face. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air. I was born too late to a world that doesn't care. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair. I was born too late to a world that doesn't care. Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hairTake it back, take it back. Everybody look at me me. I walk in the door you start screaming. C'mon everybody what you here for.

Chemistry was crazy from the get go. Neither one of us knew why. We didn't build nothing overnight. 'Cause a love like this takes some time. People swore it off as a phase, said we can't see that. Now from top to bottom they see that we did that, yes. It's so true that yes, we've been through it, yes. We got real shit, yes, see baby we've been. Too strong for too long and I can't be without you baby. And I'll be waiting up until you get home. 'Cause I can't sleep without you baby. Anybody who's ever loved, you know just what I feel. Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it. Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby, yeah. I got a question for you. See I already know the answer but still I wanna ask you. Would you lie? No, make me cry? No. Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?. Well, neither would I, baby. My love is only your love, yes. I'll be faithful, yes, I'm for real, yes.

It's my life.... My own words I guess.... . [Verse 1]. Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?. Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?. When they know they're your heart. And you know you were their armour. And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em. But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?. And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?. What happens when you become the main source of a pain?. "Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane. "Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?". I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy. Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself. I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself. Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her. And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her. That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy. Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby.... . [Chorus]. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain. Just smile back. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain. Just smile back.... . [Verse 2]. I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing. She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing. "You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?". Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying. "You always say that, you always say this is the last time. "But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine". She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it. "Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!". Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket. It's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'". I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror. These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em. They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight. Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late. And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door. It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on. And I'm singing.... . [Chorus]. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain. Just smile back. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain. Just smile back.... . [Verse 3]. Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat. The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet. I take a bow and thank you all for coming out. They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd. I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing. "Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,". But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?. "I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'. "You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad. "And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'. "That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin. "I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are gone". But baby wait, "it's too late Dad, you made the choice. "Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us". That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name. It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill. Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real. I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see. How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me. I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it. Put it to my brain and scream "die Shady" and pop it. The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes. That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'. It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her. Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister. Almost as if to say... . [Chorus/Outro]. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain. Just smile back. And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn. Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice. Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling. And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain. Just smile back.... . [Curtains closing and sounds of footsteps](Don't forget about us). Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go. No, baby, no, baby, no, baby, no.   (Don't forget about us). Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go. My baby boy. Just let it die with no goodbyes. Details don't matter, we both paid the price. Tears in my eyes, you know sometimes. It'd be like that, baby, yeah. Now every time I see you. I pretend I'm fine. When I wanna reach out to you. But I turn and I walk and I let it ride. Baby, I must confess. We were bigger than anything. Remember us at our best. And don't forget about. Late nights, playin' in the dark. And wakin' up inside my arms. Boy, you'll always be in my heart and. I can see it in your eyes, you still want it. So don't forget about us. I'm just speaking from experience. Nothing can compare to your first true love. So I hope this will remind you. When it's for real, it's forever. So don't forget about us. Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship. But we both know, nothing comes close to. What we had, it perseveres. That we both can't forget it, how good we used to get it. There's only one me and you. And how we used to shine. No matter what you go through. We are one, that's a fact. That you can't deny. So, baby, we just can't let. The fire pass us by. Forever we'd both regret. So don't forget about. Late nights, playin' in the dark. And wakin' up inside my arms. Boy, you'll always be in my heart and. I can see it in your eyes, you still want it. So don't forget about us. I'm just speaking from experience. Nothing can compare to your first true love. So I hope this will remind you. When it's for real, it's forever. So don't forget about us. And if she's got your head all messed up now. That's the trickery. She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be. I bet she can't do like me, she'll never be MC. Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us. Late nights, playin' in the dark. And wakin' up inside my arms. Boy, you'll always be in my heart and. I can see it in your eyes, you still want it. So don't forget about us. I'm just speaking from experience. Nothing can compare to your first true love. So I hope this will remind you. When it's for real, it's forever. So don't forget about us. Late nights, playin' in the dark. And wakin' up inside my arms. Boy, you'll always be in my heart and. I can see it in your eyes, you still want it. So don't forget about us. I'm just speaking from experience. Nothing can compare to your first true love. So I hope this will remind you. When it's for real, it's forever. So don't forget about us. Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go. No, baby, no, baby, no, baby no. Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go. When it's for real, it's forever. So don't forget about usI never knew. I never knew that everything was falling through. That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue. To turn and run when all I needed was the truth. But that's how it's got to be. It's coming down to nothing more than apathy. I'd rather run the other way than stay and see. The smoke and who's still standing when it clears. Everyone knows I'm in. Over my head, over my head. With eight seconds left in overtime. She's on your mind, she's on your mind. Let's rearrange. I wish you were a stranger I could disengage. Just say that we agree and then never change. Soften a bit until we all just get along. But that's disregard. Find another friend and you discard. As you lose the arguments in a cable car. Hanging above as the canyon comes between. Everyone knows I'm in. Over my head, over my head. With eight seconds left in overtime. She's on your mind, she's on your mind. Everyone knows I'm in. Over my head, over my head. With eight seconds left in overtime. She's on your mind, she's all on. And suddenly I become a part of your past. I'm becoming the part that don't last. I'm losing you and its effortless. Without a sound we lose sight of the ground. In the throw around. Never thought that you wanted to bring it down. I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves. And everyone knows I'm in. Over my head, over my head. With eight seconds left in overtime. She's on your mind, she's on your mind. Everyone knows she's on your mind. Everyone knows I'm in over my head. I'm in over my head, I'm over my.... Everyone knows I'm in. Over my head, over my head. With eight seconds left in overtime. She's on your mind, she's on your mindYou only stay with me in the morning. You only hold me when I sleep. I was meant to tread the water. But now I' ve gotten in too deep. For every piece of me that wants you. Another piece backs away. You Give Me Something. That makes me scared, alright. This could be nothing. But I'm willing to give it a try.. Please give me something. Because someday I might know my heart.. You only waited up for hours. Just to spend a little time alone with me. I can say I' ve bought you flowers. Because I can't work out what they mean. I never thought that I'd love someone. That was someone else's dream. You Give Me Something. That makes me scared, alright.. This could be nothing. But I'm willing to give it a try.. Please give me something. Because someday I might know my heart.. Someday I might call you from my heart,. but it might be a second too late. And the words that I could never say. Are gonna come out anyway .. You Give Me Something. That makes me scared, alright.. This could be nothing. But I'm willing to give it a try.. Please give me something. mhmm. You Give Me Something. That makes me scared, alright.. This could be nothing. But I'm willing to give it a try.. Please give me something. Because someday I might know my heart.. know my heart.. know my heart.. know my heart.. knoooooooooowHa, ha, haa<br />. Pump it!<br />. Ha, ha, haa<br />. <br />. And pump it louder<br />.

I said hey, oh yeah, oh yeah, tell my love now. Hey, hey yeah, oh yeahWe'll do it all. Everything. On our own. We don't need. Anything. Or anyone. If I lay here. If I just lay here. Would you lie with me. And just forget the world?. I don't quite know. How to say. How I feel. Those three words. Are said too much. They're not enough. If I lay here. If I just lay here. Would you lie with me. And just forget the world?. Forget what we're told. Before we get too old. Show me a garden. That's bursting into life. Let's waste time. Chasing cars. Around our heads. I need your grace. To remind me. To find my own. If I lay here. If I just lay here. Would you lie with me. And just forget the world?. Forget what we're told. Before we get too old. Show me a garden. That's bursting into life. All that I am. All that I ever was. Is here in your perfect eyes. They're all I can see. I don't know where. Confused about how as well. Just know that these things.

Uh huh, that's right. . I took your words and I believed. In everything you said to me. Yeah huh, that's right. . If someone said three years from now. You'd be long gone. I'd stand up and punch them out. â€~Cause they're all wrong. . I know better. â€~Cause you said forever. And ever, who knew?. . Remember when we were such fools. And so convinced and just too cool. Oh no, no no. . I wish I could touch you again. I wish I could still call you a friend. I'd give anything. . When someone said count your blessings now. For they're long gone. I guess I just didn't know how. I was all wrong. . But they knew better. Still you said forever and ever. Who knew? Yeah yeah. . I'll keep you locked in my head. Until we meet again. Until we, until we meet again. And I won't forget you my friend. What happened?. . If someone said three years from now. You'd be long gone. I'd stand up and punch them out. â€~Cause they're all wrong. . And that last kiss I'll cherish. Until we meet again. And time makes it harder. I wish I could remember. . But I keep your memory. You visit me in my sleep. My darling, who knew?. . My darling. My darling, who knew?. My darling I miss you. My darling, who knew?. . Who knew?Oh, well imagine.

Trying hard to reach out. But when I'd try to speak out. Felt like no one could hear me. Wanted to belong here. But something felt so wrong here. So I pray. I could breakaway. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. I'll do what it takes til I touch the sky. And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change. And breakaway. Out of the darkness and into the sun. But I won't forget all the ones that I loved. I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And breakaway. Wanna feel the warm breeze. Sleep under a palm tree. Feel the rush of the ocean. Get onboard a fast train. Travel on a jet plane, far away. And breakaway. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky. And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change. And breakaway. Out of the darkness and into the sun. I won't forget all the ones that I loved. I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And breakaway. Buildings with a hundred floors. Swinging 'round revolving doors. Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but. Gotta keep moving on, moving on. Fly away, breakaway. I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye. I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And breakaway. Out of the darkness and into the sun. But I won't forget the place I come from. I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change. And breakaway. Breakaway. BreakawayHoney, why you calling me so late?. It's kind of hard to talk right now. Honey, why you crying? Is everything OK?. I got to whisper 'cause I can't be too loud. Oh well, my girl's in the next room. Sometimes, I wish she was you. I guess we never really moved on. It's really good to hear your voice saying my name. It sounds so sweet. Coming from the lips of an angel. Hearing those words; it makes me weak. And I never want to say goodbye. But girl, you make it hard to be faithful. With the lips of an angel. It's funny that you're calling me tonight. And yes, I dreamt of you too. And does he know you're talking to me?. Will it start a fight?. No, I don't think she has a clue. Oh well, my girl's in the next room. Sometimes, I wish she was you. I guess we never really moved on.

And with each new day. I can feel a change in everything. And as the surface breaks reflections fade. But in some ways they remain the same. And as my mind begins to spread its wings. There's no stopping curiosity. I want to turn the whole thing upside down. I'll find the things they say just can't be found. I'll share this love I find with everyone. We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs. I don't want this feeling to go away. Who's to say I can't do everything?. Well I can try, and as I roll along I begin to find. Things aren't always just what they seem. I want to turn the whole thing upside down. I'll find the things they say just can't be found. I'll share this love I find with everyone. We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's song. This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste. Well it all keeps spinning, spinning. Round and round and upside down. Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found?. I don't want this feeling to go away. Please don't go away. Please don't go away. Please don't go away. Is this how it's supposed to be?.

I said, "Don't look back, just keep on walking.". (woo-hoo, woo-hoo). When the big black horse said, "Look this way.". He said, "Hey lady, will you marry me?". (woo-hoo, woo-hoo). But I said, "No, no. No, no-no-no.. "No, no. You're not the one for me.. "No, no. No, no-no-no.. "No, no. You're not the one for me.". (ooooo, woo-hoo). No, no, no, no..

No learning while you're in the line. I'll take you to the broken sign. You see these lights are blue. Come and get it, lost it at the city limit. Say goodbye 'cause they will find a way to trim it. Everybody looking for a silly gimmick. Gotta get away, can't take it for another minute. This town is made of many things. Just look at what the current brings. So high it's only promising. This place was made on you. Tell me baby, what's your story. Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw. Oh, tell me lover, are you lonely. The thing we need is never all that hard to find aw. Tell me baby, what's your story. Where do you come from and where you want to go this time aw. Oh, you're so lovely, are you lonely. Or giving up on the innocence you left behind. Some claim to have the fortitude. Too shrewd to blow the interlude. Sustaining pain to set a mood. Step out to be renewed. I'll move you like a baritone. Jungle brothers on the microphone. Getting over with an undertone. It's time to turn to stone. Chitty chitty baby when your nose is in the nitty gritty. Life could be a little sweet but life could be a little shitty. What a pity, Boston and a Kansas City. Lookin' for a hundred but you only ever found a fitty. Three fingers in the honeycomb. You ring just like a xylophone. Devoted to the chromosome. The day that you left home. Tell me baby, what's your story. Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw. Oh, tell me lover, are you lonely. The thing we need is never all that hard to find aw. Tell me baby, what's your story. Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw. Oh, you're so lovely, are you lonely. Or giving up on the innocence you left behind. Tell me baby, what's your story. Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw. Oh, tell me lover, are you lonely. The thing we need is never all that hard to find aw. Tell me baby, what's your story. Where you come from and where you want to go this time aw.

Waiting on some beautiful boy. To save you from your old ways. You play forgiveness. Watch it now- here he comes. He doesn't look a thing like Jesus. But he talks like a gentlemen. Like you imagined when you were young. Can we climb this mountain. I don't know. Higher now than ever before. I know we can make it if we take it slow. Let's take it easy. Easy now, watch it go. We're burning down the highway skyline. On the back of a hurricane that started turning. When you were young. When you were young. And sometimes you close your eyes. and see the place where you Used to live. When you were young. They say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet. You don't have to drink right now. But you can dip your feet. Every once in a little while. You sit there in your heartache. Waiting on some beautiful boy. To save you from your old ways. You play forgiveness. Watch it now- here he comes. He doesn't look a thing like Jesus. But he talks like a gentlemen. Like you imagined when you were young. When you were young. I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus. He doesn't look a thing like Jesus. But more than you'll ever knowDid I disappoint you or let you down?. Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?. 'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,. Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.. So I took what's mine by eternal right.. Took your soul out into the night.. It may be over but it won't stop there,. I am here for you if you'd only care.. You touched my heart you touched my soul.. You changed my life and all my goals.. And love is blind and that I knew when,. My heart was blinded by you.. I've kissed your lips and held your head.. Shared your dreams and shared your bed.. I know you well, I know your smell.. I've been addicted to you.. Goodbye my lover.. Goodbye my friend.. You have been the one.. You have been the one for me.. I am a dreamer but when I wake,. You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.. And as you move on, remember me,. Remember us and all we used to be. I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.. I've watched you sleeping for a while.. I'd be the father of your child.. I'd spend a lifetime with you.. I know your fears and you know mine.. We've had our doubts but now we're fine,. And I love you, I swear that's true.. I cannot live without you.. Goodbye my lover.. Goodbye my friend.. You have been the one.. You have been the one for me.. And I still hold your hand in mine.. In mine when I'm asleep.. And I will bear my soul in time,. When I'm kneeling at your feet.. Goodbye my lover.. Goodbye my friend.. You have been the one.. You have been the one for me.. I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.. I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.Three little birds, sat on my window. And they told me I don't need to worry. Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet. Little girls double-dutch on the concrete.. Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right. The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same.. Ooh, don't you hesitate. Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song. You go ahead, let your hair down. Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams. Just go ahead, let your hair down.. You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow.. Blue as the sky, sombre and lonely. Sipping tea in the bar by the road side (just relax, just relax). Don't you let those other boys fool you. Gotta love that afro hairdo.. Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right. The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change.. Don't you think it's strange?. Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song. You go ahead, let your hair down. Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams. Just go ahead, let your hair down.. You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow.. Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake. Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger. When you gonna realise that you don't even have to try any longer?. Do what you want to.. Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song. You go ahead, let your hair down. Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams. Just go ahead, let your hair down.. Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song. You go ahead, let your hair down. Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams. Just go ahead, let your hair down..

Beautiful dawn, I'm just chasing time again. Thought I would die a lonely man, in endless night. But now I'm high running wild among all the stars above. Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me. Beautiful, dawn melt with the stars again. Do you remember the day when my journey began?. Will you remember the end of time?. Beautiful dawn, you're just blowing my mind again. Thought I was born to endless night, until you shine. High running wild among all the stars above. Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me. Will you be my shoulder when I'm gray and older?. Promise me tomorrow starts with you. Getting high running wild among all the stars above. Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me. High running wild among all the stars above. Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember meWhere'd you go?. I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone.. She said "Some days I feel like shit. .... Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit,". I don't understand why you have to always be gone. I get along but the trips always feel so long. And, I find myself tryna stay by the phone. 'Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone. But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call. But when I pick up I don't have much to say. So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up. That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'. Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career. Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?". I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone.. Where'd you go?. I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone. Please come back home.... You know the place where you used to live. Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs. Used to have a little party every Hallowe'en with candy by the pile. But now, you only stop by every once in a while. Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time. Anything to keep the thought of you from my mind. I'm doin' fine, I plan to keep it that way. You can call me if you find you have somethin' to say. And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up. That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'. Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career. Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?". I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone.. Where'd you go?. I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone. Please come back home.... I want you to know it's a little fucked up. That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'. Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses. For while you're not around, and feeling so useless. It seems one thing has been true all along. You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone. I guess I've had it with you and your career. When you come back I won't be here and you'll can sing it.... Where'd you go?. I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone.. Where'd you go?. I miss you so. Seems like it's been forever. That you've been gone. Please come back home. Please come back home. Please come back home. Please come back home. .... Please come back home. ...Storch (oh). S. Dot (Yea. Ooh Ohh.. The dynamic duo.. Wow womp womp womp... it's what your body sayin'..

Some sort of window to your right. As he goes left and you stay right. Between the lines of fear and blame. You begin to wonder why you came. Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend. Somewhere along in the bitterness. And I would have stayed up with you all night. Had I known how to save a life. Let him know that you know best. 'Cause after all you do know best. Try to slip past his defense. Without granting innocence. Lay down a list of what is wrong. The things you've told him all along. Pray to God, he hears you. And I pray to God, he hears you. And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend. Somewhere along in the bitterness. And I would have stayed up with you all night. Had I known how to save a life. As he begins to raise his voice. You lower yours and grant him one last choice. Drive until you lose the road. Or break with the ones you've followed. He will do one of two things. He will admit to everything. Or he'll say he's just not the same. And you'll begin to wonder why you came. Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend. Somewhere along in the bitterness. And I would have stayed up with you all night. Had I known how to save a life. Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend. Somewhere along in the bitterness. And I would have stayed up with you all night. Had I known how to save a life.

Someone I thought had died so long ago. Oh, I'm screaming out and my dreams'll be heard. They will not be pushed aside on words. Into your own all 'cause you won't. Listen. Listen, I am alone at a crossroads. I'm not at home in my own home. And I've tried and tried to say what's on mind. You should have known. Oh, now I'm done believing you. You don't know what I'm feeling. I'm more than what you made of me. I followed the voice you gave to me. But now I've gotta find my own. I don't know where I belong. But I'll be moving on. If you don't, if you won't. Listen to the song here in my heart. A melody I start but I will complete. Oh, now I'm done believing you. You don't know what I'm feeling. I'm more than what you made of me. I followed the voice you think you gave to me. But now I've gotta find my own, my ownI heard there was a secret chord. That David played and it pleased the Lord. But you don't really care for music, do you?. Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth. The minor fall and the major lift. The baffled king composing Hallelujah. Well your faith was strong but you needed proof. You saw her bathing on the roof. Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you. She tied you to her kitchen chair. She broke your throne and she cut your hair. And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah. Baby, I've been here before. I've seen this room and I've walked this floor. You know, I used to live alone before, I knew you. And I've seen your flag on the marble arch. And Love is not a victory march. It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah. Well, there was a time when you let me know. What's really going on below. But now you never show that to me, do you?. But remember, when I moved in you. And the holy dove was moving too. And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah. Maybe there's a God above. But, all I've ever learned from love. Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?. And it's not a cry, that you hear at night. It's not somebody, who's seen the light. It's a cold and it's a broken HallelujahThe shackles are undone, the bullets quit the gun. The heat that's in the sun will keep us when there's none. The rule has been disproved, the stone it has been moved. The grave is now a groove, all debts are removed. Oh can't you see what love has done?. Oh can't you see what love has done?. Oh can't you see what love has done?. What it's done to me?. Love makes strange enemies, makes love where love may please. The soul and its striptease, hate brought to its knees. The sky over our head, we can reach it from our bed. You let me in your heart and out of my head, head. Oh can't you see what love has done?. Oh can't you see what love has done?. Oh can't you see what love has done?. What it's done to me?. Oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh. Please don't ever let me out of you. I've got no shame, oh no, oh no. Oh can't you see what love has done?. Oh can't you see?. Oh can't you see what love has done?. What it's doing to me?.   (Oh can't you see what love has done?). I know I hurt you and I made you cry. Did everything but murder you and I.   (Oh can't you see what love has done?).   (Oh can't you see what love has done?). But love left a window in the skies.   (What it's doing to me?). And to love I rhapsodize.   (Oh can't you see what love has done?). To every broken heart.   (Oh can't you see what love has done?). For every heart that cries.   (Oh can't you see what love has done?). Love left a window in the skies.   (What it's doing to me?). And to love I rhapsodize. Oh can't you see?Are you ready?. If you ain't got no money take yo' broke broke home, you say it. If you ain't got no money take yo' broke broke home. G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S. We flyin' first class. Up in the sky. Poppin' champagne. Livin' my life. In the fast lane.

You'll probably move right through me on my way to you. I hold out for one more drink, before I think. I'm lookin' too desperately. But so far has not been fun. I should just stay home, if one thing really means one. This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks. That would be cool with me. Well, I'm still imagining a dark lit place.

Come take a walk with me. Let's pretend we're just two people and. You're not better than me. I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly. What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?. Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?. What do you feel when you look in the mirror?. Are you proud?. How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?. How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?. How do you walk with your head held high?. Can you even look me in the eye. And tell me why?. Dear Mr. President. Were you a lonely boy?. Are you a lonely boy?. Are you a lonely boy?. How can you say. No child is left behind?. We're not dumb and we're not blind. They're all sitting in your cells. While you pave the road to hell. What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?. And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?. I can only imagine what the first lady has to say. You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine. How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?. How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?. How do you walk with your head held high?. Can you even look me in the eye?. Let me tell you 'bout hard work. Minimum wage with a baby on the way. Let me tell you 'bout hard work. Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away. Let me tell you 'bout hard work. Building a bed out of a cardboard box. Let me tell you 'bout hard work. Hard work. Hard work. You don't know nothing 'bout hard work. Hard work. Hard work. Oh. How do you sleep at night?. How do you walk with your head held high?. Dear Mr. President. You'd never take a walk with me. Would you?Thursday night, everything's fine. Except you've got that look in your eye. When I'm telling a story. And you find it boring. You're thinking of something to say. You'll go along with it then drop it. And humiliate me in front of our friends. Then I'll use that voice that you find annoying. And say something like. Yeah, intelligent input darling. Why don't you just have another beer then?. Then you'll call me a bitch. And everyone we're with will be embarrassed. And I won't give a shit. My fingertips are holding onto. The cracks in our foundation. And I know that I should let go but I can't. And every time we fight. I know it's not right. Every time that you're upset. And I smile. I know I should forget but I can't. You said I must eat so many lemons. 'Cause I am so bitter. I said "I'd rather be with your friends, mate. 'Cause they are much fitter. Yes it was childish. And you got aggressive. And I must admit that I was a bit scared. But it gives me thrills to wind you up. My fingertips are holding onto. The cracks in our foundation. And I know that I should let go but I can't. And every time we fight. I know it's not right. Every time that you're upset. And I smile. I know I should forget but I can't. Your face is pasty. 'Cause you've gone and got so wasted. What a surprise. Don't want to look at your face. 'Cause it's making me sick. You've gone and got sick on my trainers. I only got these yesterday. Oh my gosh, I cannot be bothered with this. Well I'll leave you there 'til the morning. And I purposely won't turn the heating on. And dear God, I hope I'm not stuck with this one. My fingertips are holding. Onto the cracks in our foundation. And I know that I should let go but I can't. And every time we fight. I know it's not right. Every time that you're upset. And I smile. I know I should forget but I can't. And every time we fight. I know it's not right. Every time that you're upset. And I smile. I know I should forget but I can't. And every time we fight. I know it's not right. Every time that you're upset. And I smile. I know I should forget but I can'tSongwriters: Harris, Clifford; Jackson, Ronnie; Kelly, Robert; Moss, Shad; Najm, Faheem; Najm, Faheem Rasheed. Kells, Bow Weezy . Jacking for chicks .

"Why does every moment have to be so hard?". Hard to believe it. It´s not over, tonight. Just give me one more chance to make it right. I may not make it through the night. I won´t go home without you. The taste of her breath, I´ll never get over. The noises that she made kept me awake, ohh. The weight of the things that remain unspoken. Built up so much, it crushed us every day. Every night you cry yourself to sleep. thinking "why does this happen to me?". "Why does every moment have to be so hard?". Hard to believe it.

And another one he don't know about. Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that. Tell you I love you but when you call, I never get back. Would you ask them questions like me, like 'Where you be at?'. 'Cuz I'm out, four in the morning on the corner rolling doing my own thing. What if I had a thing on the side, made you cry.

I'm not running from, no, I think you got me all wrong. I don't regret this life I chose for me. But these places and these faces are getting old. So I'm going home, well I'm going home. The miles are getting longer, it seems, the closer I get to you. I've not always been the best man or friend for you. But your love it makes true and I don't know why. You always seem to give me another try. So I'm going home, back to the place where I belong. And where your love has always been enough for me. I'm not running from, no, I think you got me all wrong. I don't regret this life I chose for me. But these places and these faces are getting old. Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it all. You just might get it all and then some you don't want. Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it all. You just might get it all, yeah. Oh, well I'm going home, back to the place where I belong. And where your love has always been enough for me. I'm not running from, no, I think you got me all wrong. I don't regret this life I chose for me. But these places and these faces are getting old. I said these places and these faces are getting old. So I'm going home, I'm going homeSantana.

As one big family with love and bliss. And even though Pops treated us like kings. He got a second wife and you didn't agree. He got up and left you there all alone. I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own. I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief. I'm sorry that your son was once a thief. I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast. I wish I would've listened and not be so bad. I'm sorry that your life turned out this way. I'm sorry that the FEDS came and took me away. I understand that there are some problems. And I am not too blind to know. All the pain you kept inside you. Even though you might not show. If I can't apologize for being wrong. Then it's just a shame on me. I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me. You can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me. Said you can put the blame on me, Said you can put the blame on me, Said you can put the blame on me, You can put the blame on me. I'm sorry that it took so long to see. They were dead wrong trying to put it on me. I'm sorry that it took so long to speak. But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani. I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt. For the embarrassment that she felt. Just a little young girl trying to have fun. Her daddy should've never let her out that young. I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down. I hope they manage better next time around. How was I to know she was underage. In a 21 and older club they say. Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame. Verizon backed out disgracing my name. I'm just a singer trying to entertain. Because I love my fans I'll take that blame. Even though the blame's on you, I'll take that blame from you. And you can put that blame on me, You can put that blame on me. And you can put that blame on me. And you can put that blame on meYa-eee! Icky thump, who'd a thunk?. Sittin' drunk on a wagon to Mexico. Ah well, what a chump, well my head. Got a bump when I hit it on the radio. Redhead seÃ±orita lookin' dead. Came and said, "Need a bed?" en espaÃ±ol. Said give me a drink of water. I'm gonna sing around the collar. Well, I don't need a microphone. Icky thump with the lump in my throat. Grabbed my coat and I was freaking, I was ready to go. Yeah, I swear, beside the hair she had one white eye. One blank stare, lookin' up, lyin' there. On a stand near her hand was a candy cane. Black rum, sugar cane, dry ice, somethin' strange. La la la. White Americans, what, nothin' better to do?. Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too. Who's usin' who? What should we do?. Well you can't be a pimp and a prostitute too. Icky thump handcuffed to a bunk. Robbed blind, looked around and there was nobody else. Left alone I hit myself with a stone. Went home and learned how to clean up after myselfAyer los dos soÃ±abamos con un mundo perfecto. Ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras. Porque en los ojos nos espiabamos el alma. Y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada. Ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero. Ayer tÃº me juraste que este amor serÃ­a eterno. Por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente. Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente. Â¿Que hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza. Hoy empaÃ±aste con tu furia mi mirada. Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia. Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba. Con un permiso para asi romperme el alma. Â¿Que hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas. Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras. Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas. Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba. Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa. MaÃ±ana que amanezca un dia nuevo en mi universo. MaÃ±ana no verÃ© tu nombre escrito entre mis versos. No escucharÃ© palabras de arrepentimiento. IgnorarÃ© sin pena tu remordimiento. MaÃ±ana olvidarÃ© que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante. MaÃ±ana ni siquiera habrÃ¡ razones para odiarte. Yo borrarÃ© todos tus sueÃ±os de mis sueÃ±os. Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos. Â¿Que hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza. Hoy empaÃ±aste con tu furia mi mirada. Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia. Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba. Con un permiso para asi romperme el alma. Â¿Que hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas. Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras. Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas. Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba. Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa. Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba. Con un permiso para asi romperme el alma. Â¿Que hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas. Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras. Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas. Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba. Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casaI don't know why. You want to follow me tonight. When in the rest of the world. With you whom I've crossed and I've quarreled. Let's me down so. For a thousand reasons that I know. To share forever the unrest. With all the demons I possess. Beneath the silver moon. Maybe you were right. But baby I was lonely. I don't want to fight. I'm tired of being sorry. 8th and Ocean Drive. With all the vampires and their brides. We're all bloodless and blind. And longing for a life. Beyond the silver moon. Maybe you were right. But baby I was lonely. I don't want to fight. I'm tired of being sorry. I'm standing in the street. Crying out for you. No one sees me. But the silver moon. So far away – so outer space. I've trashed myself – I've lost my way. I've got to get to you got to get to you. Maybe you were right. But baby I was lonely. I don't want to fight. I'm tired of being sorry. I'm standing in the street. Crying out for you. No one sees me. But the silver moon. (lalalala till end). Maybe you were right. But baby I was lonely. I don't want to fight. I'm tired of being sorry. I'm standing in the street. Crying out for you. No one sees me. But the silver moonClosed off from love. I didn't need the pain. Once or twice was enough. And it was all in vain. Time starts to pass. Before you know it you're frozen. But something happened. For the very first time with you. My heart melted to the ground. Found something true. And everyone's looking around. Thinking I'm going crazy. But I don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vein. That I keep on closing. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open. Trying hard not to hear. But they talk so loud. Their piercing sounds fill my ears. Try to fill me with doubt. Yet I know that the goalIs to keep me from falling. But nothing's greater than the rush. That comes with your embrace. And in this world of loneliness. I see your face. Yet everyone around me. Thinks that I'm going crazy. Maybe, maybe. But I don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vain. That I keep on closing. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open. And it's draining all of me. Oh, they find it hard to believe. I'll be wearing these scars. For everyone to see. I don't care what they say. I'm in love with you. They try to pull me away. But they don't know the truth. My heart's crippled by the vain. That I keep on closing. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. I keep bleeding. I keep, keep bleeding love. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding love. You cut me open and I. Keep bleeding. Keep, keep bleeding loveThis was never the way I planned. Not my intention. I got so brave. Drink in hand. Lost my discretion. It's not what I'm used to. Just wanna try you on. I'm curious for you.

No more, it cannot wait I'm yours. Well open up your mind and see like me. Open up your plans and damn you're free. Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love.

(There's no need to complicated). Cause our time is short. This is, this is, this is our fate. I'm yoursI used to rule the world. Seas would rise when I gave the word. Now in the morning I sleep alone. Sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice. Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listen as the crowd would sing. "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!". One minute I held the key. Next the walls were closed on me. And I discovered that my castles stand. Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand. I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing. Roman Calvary choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain. Once you go there was never. Never an honest word. And that was when I ruled the world. It was the wicked and wild wind. Blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sound of drums. People couldn't believe what I'd become. Revolutionaries wait. For my head on a silver plate. Just a puppet on a lonely string. Oh who would ever want to be king?. I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing. Roman Calvary choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. My missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain. I know Saint Peter won't call my name. Never an honest word. But that was when I ruled the world. I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing. Roman Calvary choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield. My missionaries in a foreign field.

And go drink beer with the guys. And chase after girls. I'd kick it with who I wanted. And I'd never get confronted for it. 'Cause they stick up for me. If I were a boy. I think I could understand. How it feels to love a girl. I swear I'd be a better man. I'd listen to her. 'Cause I know how it hurts. When you lose the one you wanted. 'Cause he's taking you for granted. And everything you had got destroyed. If I were a boy. I would turn off my phone. Tell everyone it's broken. So they'd think that I was sleeping alone. I'd put myself first. And make the rules as I go. 'Cause I know that she'd be faithful. Waiting for me to come home, to come home. If I were a boy. I think I could understand. How it feels to love a girl. I swear I'd be a better man. I'd listen to her. 'Cause I know how it hurts. When you lose the one you wanted. 'Cause he's taking you for granted. And everything you had got destroyed. It's a little too late for you to come back. Say it's just a mistake. Think I'd forgive you like that. If you thought I would wait for you. You thought wrong. But you're just a boy. You don't understand. And you don't understand, oh. How it feels to love a girl. Someday you wish you were a better man. You don't listen to her. You don't care how it hurts.

Can't live, Can't breathe with no air. It's how I feel whenever you ain't there. There's no air, no air. Got me out here in the water so deep. Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?. If you ain't here I just can't breathe. There's no air, no air. No air, air. No air, air. No air, air. No air, air. I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew. Right off the ground To float to you.

Will you do it like that?. Now, if she touches like this. Will you touch her right back?. Now, if she moves like this. Will you move like that?. Come on. Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it. I saw you dancing there. I couldn't get you off my mind. But I could tell, that you could tell. That I was taking my time. But I was thinking of ways. To get you staying the night. Your body's shaking. Turn me on, so I can turn off the lights. Now, if she does it like this. Will you do it like that?. Now, if she touches like this. Will you touch her right back?. Now, if she moves like this. Will you move like that?. Come on. Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it. (Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it) x3It's been the longest winter without you. I didn't know where to turn to. See somehow I can't forget you. After all that we've been through. Going coming thought I heard a knock. Who's there no one. Thinking that I deserve it. Now I realize that I really didn't know. If you didn't notice you mean everything. Quickly I'm learning to love again. All I know is I'm gonna be OK. Thought I couldn't live without you. It's gonna hurt when it heals too. It'll all get better in time. And even though I really love you. I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to. It'll all get better in time. I couldn't turn on the TV. Without something there to remind me. Was it all that easy. To just put aside your feelings. If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh. Hurt my feelings but that's the path. I believe in. And I know that time will heal it. If you didn't notice boy you meant everything. Quickly I'm learning to love again. All I know is I'm gonna be OK. Thought I couldn't live without you. It's gonna hurt when it heals too. It'll all get better in time. And even though I really love you. I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to. It'll all get better in time. Since there's no more you and me. It's time I let you go. So I can be free. And live my life how it should be. No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you. Yes I will. Thought I couldn't live without you. It's gonna hurt when it heals too. It'll all get better in time. And even though I really love you. I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to. It'll all get better in time. Thought I couldn't live without you. It's gonna hurt when it heals too. It'll all get better in time. And even though I really love you. I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to. It'll all get better in timeWe're driving slow through the snow on 5th Avenue. And right now radio's all that we can hear. Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue. It's cold outside but between us it's worse in here. The world slows down. But my heart beats fast right now. I know this is the part. Where the end starts. I can't take it any longer. Thought that we were stronger. All we do is linger. Slipping through my fingers. I don't wanna try now. All that's left's goodbye to. Find a way that I can tell you. I hate this part right here. I hate this part right here. I just can't take your tears. I hate this part right here. Everyday, seven takes of the same old scene. Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine. Gotta talk to you now 'fore we go to sleep. But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?. The world slows down. But my heart beats fast right now. I know this is the part. Where the end starts. I can't take it any longer. Thought that we were stronger. All we do is linger. Slipping through our fingers. I don't wanna try now. All that's left's goodbye to. Find a way that I can tell you. I hate this part right here. I hate this part right here. I just can't take your tears. I hate this part right here. I know you'll ask me to hold on. And carry on like nothing's wrong. But there is no more time for lies. 'Cause I see sunset in your eyes. I can't take it any longer. Thought that we were stronger. All we do is linger. Slipping through our fingers. I don't wanna try now. All that's left's goodbye to. Find a way that I can tell you. That I gotta do it. I gotta do it. I gotta do it. I hate this part. I gotta do it. I gotta do it. I gotta do it, oh. I hate this part right here. I hate this part right here. I just can't take these tearsOh the wind whistles down. The cold dark street tonight. And the people they were dancing. To the music vibe. And the boys chase the girls, with curls in their hair. While shy tormented youth sit way over there. And the songs get louder each one better than before. And you singing the song thinking this is the life. And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size. where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?. And you singing the song thinking this is the life. And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size. Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?. Where you gonna sleep tonight. So you're heading down the road in your taxi for 4. And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door. But nobody's in and nobody's home till 4. So you're sitting there with nothing to do. Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew. And where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to. What I had to do, had to run from you. I'm in love with you but the vibe is wrong. And that haunted me, all the way home. So you never know, never never know. Never know enough, 'til it's over love. 'Til we lose control, system overload. Screamin' "No! No! No! N-No!". I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to. See I wanna move, but can't escape from you. So I keep it low, keep a secret code. So everybody else don't have to know. So keep your love locked down. Your love locked down. Keepin' your love locked down. Your love locked down. Now keep your love locked down. Your love locked down. Now keep your love locked down. You lose. I'm not lovin' you the way I wanted to. I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true. I got somethin to lose, so I gotta move. I can't keep myself, and still keep you too. So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own. Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone. How many times did I tell ya fo it finally got through. You lose, you lose. I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to. See I had to go, see I had to move. No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life. We're just racing' time, where's the finish line. So keep your love locked down. Your love locked down. Keepin' your love locked down. Your love locked down. Now keep your love locked down. Your love locked down. Now keep your love locked down. You lose. I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to. I bet no one knew, I got no one new. I know I said I'm through, but got love for you. But I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to. Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' goin'. Keep it on a roll, only God knows. If I be with you, baby I'm confused. You choose, you choose. I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to. Where I wanna go, I don't need you. I've been down this road, too many times before. I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to. So keep your love locked down. Your love locked down. Keepin' your love locked down. Your love locked down. Now keep your love locked down. Your love locked down. Now keep your love locked down. You lose, you lose. You lose, you lose. You lose[Intro: ~T.I.~]. Ay J-O, you know the ol' sugar daddies*. They be trickin, they tell them girls. I said you could have whatever you like (if you like).

But easy come and easy go. And it would end. So why anytime I bleed, you let me go. Anytime I feed you get me know. Anytime I see you let me know. But I plan and see just let me go.

Why we chewing, why we chasin'. Why the bottom, why the basement. Why we got good shit don't embrace it. Why the feel for the need to replace me. Your the wrong way track from the good. I want to paint in a picture tellin' where we could be at. Like a heart in the best way should. You can give it the away, you had it and you took the pay. But I keep walkin' on, keep open' doors.

No matter what you say about life. I learn every time I bleed. The truth is a stranger, soul is in danger. I gotta let my spirit be free. To admit that I'm wrong. And then change my mind. Sorry but I have to move on. And leave you behind. I can't waste time so give it a moment. I realize nothing's broken. No need to worry about everything I've done. Live every second like it was my last one. Don't look back, got a new direction. I loved you once, needed protection. You're still a part of everything I do. You're on my heart just like a tattoo. Just like a tattoo. I'll always have you. I'm sick of playing all of these games. It's not about taking sides. When I looked in the mirror didn't deliver. It hurt enough to think that I could. Stop, admit that I'm wrong. And then change my mind. Sorry but I've gotta be strong. And leave you behind. I can't waste time so give it a moment. I realize nothing's broken. No need to worry about everything I've done. Live every second like it was my last one. Don't look back, got a new direction. I loved you once, needed protection. You're still a part of everything I do. You're on my heart just like a tattoo. Just like a tattoo. I'll always have you. If I live every moment. Won't change any moment. That's still a part of me and you. I will never regret you. Still the memory of you. Marks everything I do. Can't waste time so give it a moment. I realize nothing's broken. No need to worry about everything I've done. Live every second like it was my last one. Don't look back, got a new direction. I loved you once, needed protection. You're still a part of everything I do. You're on my heart just like a tattoo. Can't waste time so give it a moment. I realized nothing's broken. No need to worry about everything I've done.

You're on my heart just like a tattoo. Just like a tattoo. I'll always have youThis town is colder now, I think it's sick of us. It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust. I've got my heart set on anywhere but here. I'm staring down myself, counting up the years. Steady hands, just take the wheel.... And every glance is killing me. Time to make one last appeal. For the life I lead. Stop and stare. I think I'm moving but I go nowhere. Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared. But I've become what I can't be, oh. Stop and stare. You start to wonder why you're here not there. And you'd give anything to get what's fair. But fair ain't what you really need. Oh, can you see what I see?. They're trying to come back, all my senses push. Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could.... Steady feet, don't fail me now. I'mma run 'til you can't walk. Something pulls my focus out. And I'm standing down.... Stop and stare. I think I'm moving but I go nowhere. Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared. But I've become what I can't be, oh. Stop and stare. You start to wonder why you're here not there. And you'd give anything to get what's fair. But fair ain't what you really need. Oh, you don't need. What you need, what you need.... Stop and stare. I think I'm moving but I go nowhere. Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared. But I've become what I can't be. Oh, do you see what I see?She can't help it. The girl can't help it (oh baby).

You know, this isn't the first time this has happened to me. This love sick thing. I like serious relationships and, uh. A girl like me don't stay single for long. Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up. My world is crushed, and I'm all alone. The love bug crawls right back up and bites me. And I'm back. She can't help it. The girl can't help it (in love). She can't help it. The girl can't help it (oh God). She can't help it. The girl can't help it (I'm back in love). Girl can't help it. Woo, hoo, hoo. She can't help it.

Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love). So in love with youI don't wanna be the girl who laughs the loudest. Or the girl who never wants to be alone. I don't wanna be that call at four o'clock in the mornin'. 'Cause I'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home. Ah, the sun is blindin'. I stayed up again. Oh, I am findin'. That's not the way I want my story to end. I'm safe up high, nothing can touch me. But why do I feel this party's over?. No pain inside, you're my protection. But how do I feel this good sober?. I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence. The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth. Please don't tell me that we had that conversation. 'Cause I won't remember, save your breath. 'Cause what's the use?. Ah, the night is callin'. And it whispers to me softly, "Come and play". But I, I am fallin'. And if I let myself go I'm the only one to blame. I'm safe up high, nothing can touch me. But why do I feel this party's over?. No pain inside, you're like perfection. But how do I feel this good sober?. Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down. Spinnin' 'round, spinnin' 'round, spinnin' 'round. I'm lookin' for myself, sober. Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down. Spinnin' 'round, spinnin' 'round, spinnin' 'round. Lookin' for myself, sober. When it's good, then it's good, it's so good 'til it goes bad. 'Til you're trying to find the you that you once had. I have heard myself cry 'never again'. Broken down in agony, just tryin' find a friend, oh, oh. I'm safe up high, nothing can touch me. But why do I feel this party's over?. No pain inside, you're like perfection. But how do I feel this good sober?. I'm safe up high, nothing can touch me. But why do I feel this party's over?. No pain inside, you're like perfection. But how do I feel this good sober?I've made up my mind,. Don't need to think it over. If I'm wrong, I am right. Don't need to look no further,. This ain't lust. I know this is love. But if I tell the world. I'll never say enough. 'cause it was not said to you. And that's exactly what I need to do. If I end up with you. Should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. Or would it be a waste. Even if I knew my place?. Should I leave it there?. Should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. I build myself up. And fly around in circles. Waitin' as my heart drops. And my back begins to tingle. Finally, could this be it. Or should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. Or would it be a waste. Even if I knew my place?. Should I leave it there?. Should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. Should I give up?. Or should I just keep on chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. Or would it be a waste. Even if I knew my place?. Should I leave it there?. Should I give up?. Or should I just keep on chasin' pavements?. Should I just keep on chasin' pavements?. Ohh oh. should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements. Even if it leads nowhere?. Or would it be a waste. Even if I knew my place?. Should I leave it there?. should I give up?. Or should I just keep chasin' pavements.

I fake a smile so he won't see. What I want and I need. And everything that we should be. I'll bet she's beautiful. That girl he talks about. And she's got everything. That I have to live without. Drew talks to me. I laugh 'cause it's damn funny. But I can't even see. Anyone when he's with me. He says he's so in love. He's finally got it right. I wonder if he knows. He's all I think about at night. He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar. The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star. He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do. Drew walks by me. Can he tell that I can't breathe?. And there he goes, so perfectly. The kind of flawless I wish I could be. She better hold him tight. Give him all her love. Look in those beautiful eyes. And know she's lucky 'cause. He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar. The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star. He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do. So I drive home alone. As I turn out the light. I'll put his picture down. And maybe get some sleep tonight. 'Cuz he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar. The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart. He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do.

There was snow. White snow. Clearly I remember. From the windows they were watching. While we froze down below. When the future's architectured. By a carnival of idiots on show. You'd better lie low. If you love me. Won't you let me know?. Was a long and dark December. When the banks became cathedrals. And a fox became God. Priests clutched onto bibles. Hollowed out to fit their rifles. And the cross was held aloft. Bury me in armor. When I'm dead and hit the ground. My nerves are poles that unfroze. If you love me. Won't you let me know?. I don't want to be a soldier. Who the captain of some sinking ship. Would stow, far below. So if you love me. Why'd you let me go?. I took my love down to violet hill. Then we sat in snow. All that time she was silent still. So if you love me. Won't you let me know?. If you love me. Won't you let me know?I'm in the business of misery. Let's take it from the top. She's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock. It's a matter of time before we all run out. When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth. I waited eight long months. She finally set him free. I told him I can't lie he was the only one for me. Two weeks and we had caught on fire. She's got it out for me. But I wear the biggest smile. Whoa, I never meant to brag. But, I got him where I want him now. Whoa, it was never my intention to brag. To steal it all away from you now.. But god does it feel so good. Cause I got him where I want him right now. And if you could then you know you would. Cause god it just feels so. It just feels so good. Second chances they don't ever matter, people never change. Once a whore you're nothing more,. i'm sorry, that'll never change. And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged. I'm sorry honey, but I'm passing up, now look this way. Well there's a million other girls who do it just like you. Looking as innocent as possible to get to who. They want and what they want it's easy if you do it right. Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse. Whoa, I never meant to brag. But, I got him where I want him now. Whoa, it was never my intention to brag. To steal it all away from you now.. But god does it feel so good. Cause I got him where I want him right now. And if you could then you know you would. Cause god it just feels so. It just feels so good.

To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of. But dreams just aren't enough. So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling. The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene. Straight off the silver screen. So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end. Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with. Cause nobody wants to be the last one there. Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares. Someone to love with my life in their hands. There's gotta be somebody for me like that. Cause nobody wants to go it on their own. And everyone wants to know they're not alone. There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out there. Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight. And dammit this feels too right, it's just like de ja vu. Me standing here with you. So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end?. Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with. Cause nobody wants to be the last one there. Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares. Someone to love with my life in their hands. There's gotta be somebody for me like that. Cause nobody wants to go it on their own. And everyone wants to know they're not alone. There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out there. You can't give up, (when you're looking for) a diamond in the rough (cause you never know). When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on). Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on. Cause nobody wants to be the last one there. And everyone wants to feel like someone cares. Someone to love with my life in their hands. There's gotta be somebody for me, oh. Nobody wants to go it on their own. And everyone wants to know they're not alone. There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out there. Nobody wants to be the last one there. Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares. There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere. There's gotta be somebody for me out thereYou were a child crawling on your knees toward it. Making momma so proud but your voice was too loud. We liked to watch you laughing. You picked the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences. Control yourself, take only what you need from it. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. Control yourself, take only what you need from it. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. The water is warm but it's sending me shivers. A baby is born crying out for attention. The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror. Decision to decisions are made and not bought. But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not. Control yourself, take only what you need from it. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. Control yourself, take only what you need from it. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. Control yourself, take only what you need from it. A family of trees wanting to be haunted. Control yourself, take only what you need from it. A family of trees wanting to be haunted.

The sun is on my side and takes me for a ride. I smile up to the sky, I know I'll be alrightI'm a new soul, I came to this strange world. Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take. But since I came here, felt the joy and the fear. Finding myself making every possible mistake. La-la la la, la-la-la-la la la. La-la-la-la la, la-la la, la-la la. La-la la la, la-la-la-la la la. La-la-la-la la, la-la la, la-la la. See I'm a young soul in this very strange world. Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout what is true and fake. But why all this hate? Try to communicate. Finding trust and love is not always easy to make. La-la la la, la-la-la-la la la. La-la-la-la la, la-la la, la-la la. La-la la la, la-la-la-la la la. La-la-la-la la, la-la la, la-la la, ooh. This is a happy end 'cause you don't understand. Everything you have done, why is everything so wrong?. This is a happy end, come and give me your hand. I'll take you far away. I'm a new soul, I came to this strange world. Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take. But since I came here, felt the joy and the fear. Finding myself making every possible mistake. La-la la la, la-la-la-la la la. (New soul). La-la-la-la la, la-la la, la-la la. (In this very strange world). La-la la la, la-la-la-la la la. (Every possible mistake).

La-la-la-la la, la-la la, la-la laIf you are what they say you are a superstar. Then have no fear, the camera's here. And the microphones and they wanna know. If you are that they say you are a superstar. Then have no fear, the crowd is here. And the lights are on and they want a show. A fresh cool young Lu. Trying to cash his microphone check two one two. Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue. The world brought me to my knees what have you brung you?. Did you improve on the design? Did you do something new?. Well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?. You, the more famous person you come through. And the sexy lady next to you, you come too. And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me. I'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe. Too much of a newcomer and too uncool. Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well. Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue. Go back what ever you did you undo. Heavy as Heaven, the devil on my two tons too. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. If you are what they say you are a superstar. Then have no fear, the camera's here. And the microphones and they wanna know. And you better wear your shades. The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage. Down through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid. And out through China nearly misses air liners. Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer. Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze. Now that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade. We want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay. Like the governor called and he told him to wait. Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage. The audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise. They want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. If you are that they say you are a superstar. Then have no fear, the crowd is here. And the lights are on and they want a show. . So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away. 'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days. Me and security ain't getting along. And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone. So just take me home where the mood is mellow. And the roses are thrown, M&M;'s are yellow. And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker. Everybody gets a nice autographed picture. One for you and one for your sister. Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener. Every songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback. All the reviewers say you need to go and see that. And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased. Then they all take the stage and start performing for me. Like ha ha ha ha ha.... Ha ha ha ha ha... ha. If you are what they say you are a superstar. Then have no fear, the camera's here. And the microphones and they wanna know. If you are that they say you are a superstar. Then have no fear, the crowd is here. And the lights are on and they want a showI'm gonna take my time. She gon' get hers before I. I'm gonna take it slow. I'm not gonna rush the stroke. So she can get a sensual seduction. So I can get a sensual seduction. So we can get a sensual seduction. Sensual seduction. She might be with him. But she's thinking 'bout me, me, me. We don't go to the mall.

Doggy Dogg is a freak, freak, freak. I keep a bad bitch with me. Seven days out the week, week, week. And all that we ever do. Is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets. Then smoke us a cigarette. Then go back to sleep, sleep, sleep. 'Cuz we done got a sensual seduction. Sensual seduction. Sensual seduction. Sensual seduction. I was all in da club havin' a drink no one on the suite. When I peeped this little freak out. I was all on the bar when drifter. Shawty Redd came over. Then she hit the floor, now. With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes. Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep. And a playa know if I take her home. With them real big hips, she's so right I'm gon' beat. So I approached the chick with the real pretty face. Nice curves although with a little bitty waist. I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?". I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say ****". See my game is outrageous. I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces. But it was no need for me to rush to bust one. 'Cuz I wanted her to have an eruption. Sensual seduction. Sensual seduction. Sensual seduction. Sensual seduction. Sensual seduction. Sensual seductionI've looked for love in stranger places. But never found someone like you. Someone who's smile. Makes me feel I've been holding back. An now there's nothing I can do. Cause this is real and this is good. It warms the inside just like it should. But most of all. Most of all it's built to last. It's built to last. (It's built to last). All of our friends saw from the start. So why didn't we believe it too?. Now look where we are. You're in my heart now. And there's no escaping it for you. Cause this is real and this is good. It warms the inside just like it should. But most of all. Most of all it's built to last. Walking on the hills at night. With the fire works and candle light. You and I were meant to get love right. Cause this is real and this is good. It warms the inside just like it should. But most of all. Most of all it's built to last. (It's built to last). Cause you are the sun in my universe. Consider the best when we felt the worst. But most of all. Most of all. Most of all it's built to lastTake time to realize. That your warmth is crashing down on in. Take time to realize that I am on your side. Didn't I, didn't I tell you. But I can't spell it out for you. No, it's never gonna be that simple. No, I can't spell it out for you. If you just realize what I just realized. Then we'd be perfect for each other and we'll never find another. Just realize what I just realized. We'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other now. Take time to realize, oh, oh, I'm on your side. Didn't I, didn't I tell you. Take time to realize, this all can pass you by.

If you just realize what I just realized. Then we'd be perfect for each other and we'll never find another. Just realize what I just realized. We'd never have to wonder.

Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?". Some try to hand me money, they don't understand. I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man. I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?. How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?. 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me. And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be. Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet. And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street. So I'm not moving, I'm not moving. Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here.". I said, "There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year.. Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows.. If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.". 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me. And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be. Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet. And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street. So I'm not moving, I'm not moving,. I'm not moving, I'm not moving. People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh. There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm. And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved. Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news. And you'll come running to the corner. 'Cause you'll know it's just for you. I'm the man who can't be moved. I'm the man who can't be moved. 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me. And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be.

And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street. (I'm not moving). Going back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna moveThe best thing 'bout tonight's that we're not fighting. Could it be that we have been this way before?. I know you don't think that I am trying. I know you're wearing thin down to the core. But hold your breath. Because tonight will be the night. That I will fall for you over again. Don't make me change my mind. Or I won't live to see another day. I swear it's true. Because a girl like you is impossible to find. You're impossible to find. This is not what I intended. I always swore to you I'd never fall apart. You always thought that I was stronger. I may have failed, but I have loved you from the start. Oh, but hold your breath. Because tonight will be the night. That I will fall for you over again. Don't make me change my mind. Or I won't live to see another day. I swear it's true.

I swear it's true. Because a girl like you is impossible to find. Tonight will be the night. That I will fall for you over again. Don't make me change my mind. Or I won't live to see another day. I swear it's true. Because a girl like you is impossible to find. You're impossible to findI just woke up from a fuzzy dream. You never would believe those things that I have seen. I looked in the mirror and I saw your face. You looked right through me, you were miles away. All my dreams they fade away. I'll never be the same. If you could see me the way you see yourself. I can't pretend to be someone else. You always love me more, miles away. I hear it in your voice, we're miles away. You're not afraid to tell me, miles away. I guess we're at our best when we're miles away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. When no one's around then I have you here. I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear. You always have the biggest heart. When we're six thousand miles apart. Too much of no sound. Uncomfortable silence can be so loud. Those three words are never enough. When it's long distance love. You always love me more, miles away. I hear it in your voice, we're miles away. You're not afraid to tell me, miles away. I guess we're at our best when we're miles away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true. When I'm gone you'll realize. That I'm the best thing that happened to you. You always love me more, miles away. I hear it in your voice, we're miles away. You're not afraid to tell me, miles away. I guess we're at our best when we're miles away. You always love me more, miles away. I hear it in your voice, we're miles away. You're not afraid to tell me, miles away. I guess we're at our best when we're miles away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far away. So far away, so far awayWhen I get to Warwick Avenue. Meet me by the entrance of the tube. We can talk things over alittle time. Promise me you won't step outta line.. When I get to Warwick Avenue. Please drop the past and be true. Don't think we're okay, just because I'm here. You hurt me bad, but I won't shed a tear. I'm leaving you for the last time baby. You think you're loving but you don't love me. I've been confused outta my mind lately. You think you're loving but I want to be free. Baby you've hurt me. When I get to Warwick Avenue. We'll spend an hour, but no more than two. Our only chance to speak once more. I showed you the answers, now here's the door. When I get to Warwick Avenue. I'll tell you baby... that we're through. I'm leaving you for the last time baby. You think you're loving but you don't love me. I've been confused outta my mind lately. You think you're loving but you don't love me. I want to be free, baby you've hurt me. All the days spent together. I wished for better. But I didn't want the train to come. Now it's departed, I'm broken-hearted. Seems like we never started. All those days spent together, when I wished for better. And I didn't want the train to come!. Oh, oh. You think you're loving but you don't love me. I want to be free, baby, you hurt me. You don't love me, I want to be free. Baby, you've hurt meI can take the rain on the roof of this empty house. That don't bother me. I can take a few tears now and then. And just let them out. I'm not afraid to cry. Every once in a while even though goin' on. With you gone still upsets me. There are days. Every now and again I pretend I'm okay. But that's not what gets me. What hurts the most. Was being so close. And having so much to say. And watching you walk away. Never knowing. What could have been. And not seein' that lovin' you. Is what I was tryin' to do. It's hard to deal with the pain. Of losing you everywhere I go. But I'm doin' it. It's hard to force that smile when I. See our old friends and I'm alone. Still harder. Gettin' up, gettin' dressed. Livin' with this regret. But I know if I could do it over. I would trade, give away all the words. That I saved in my heart. That I left unspoken. What hurts the most. Was being so close. And having so much to say. And watching you walk away. Never knowing. What could have been. And not seein' that lovin' you. Is what I was tryin' to do. I'm not afraid to cry. Every once in a while even though goin' on. With you gone still upsets me. There are days. Every now and again. I pretend I'm okay. But that's not what gets me. What hurts the most. Was being so close. And having so much to say. And watching you walk away. Never knowing. What could have been. And not seein' that lovin' you. Is what I was tryin' to do. What hurts the most. Was being so close. And having so much to say. And watching you walk away. Never knowing. What could have been. And not seein' that lovin' you. Is what I was tryin' to doBorn to push you around. Better just stay down. You pull away. He hits the flesh. You hit the ground. Mouths so full of lies. Tend to block your eyes. Just keep them closed. Keep praying. Just keep waiting. Waiting for the one. The day that never comes. When you stand up and feel the warmth. But the sunshine never comes, no. No, the sunshine never comes. Push you 'cross that line. Just stay down this time. Hide in yourself. Crawl in yourself. You'll have your time. God, I'll make them pay. Take it back one day. I'll end this day. I'll splatter color on this gray. Waiting for the one. The day that never comes. When you stand up and feel the warmth. But the sunshine never comes. Love is a four-letter word. And never spoken here. Love is a four-letter word. Here in this prison. I suffer this no longer. I'll put an end to this, I swear. This, I swear. The sun will shine. This, I swear. This, I swear. This, I swearHurry up and wait so close but so far away. Everything that you've always dreamed of. Close enough for you to taste but you just can't touch. You wanna show the world but no one knows your name yet. Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it. You know you can if you get the chance. In your face and the door keeps slamming. Now you're feeling more and more frustrated. And you're getting all kind of impatient, waiting. We live and we learn to take. One step at a time there's no need to rush. It's like learning to fly or falling in love. It's gonna happen and it's supposed to happen. That we find the reasons why, one step at a time. You believe and you doubt. You're confused and got it all figured out. Everything that you always wished for. Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours if they only knew. You wanna show the world but no one knows your name yet. Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it. You know you can if you get the chance. In your face and the door keeps slamming. Now you're feeling more and more frustrated. And you're getting all kind of impatient, waiting. We live and we learn to take. One step at a time there's no need to rush. It's like learning to fly or falling in love. It's gonna happen and it's supposed to happen. That we find the reasons why, one step at a time. When you can't wait any longer. But there's no end in sight. It's the faith that makes you stronger. The only way we get there is one step at a time. Take one step at a time there's no need to rush. It's like learning to fly or falling in love. It's gonna happen and it's supposed to happen. That we find the reasons why, one step at a time. One step at a time there's no need to rush. It's like learning to fly or falling in love. It's gonna happen and it's supposed to happen. That we find the reasons why, one step at a time1, 2, 3, 4.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Maybe there's a God above. But all I've ever learned from love. Is how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya. It's not a cry that you hear at night.

With my hair undone. In the front seat of his car. He's got a one-hand feel. On the steering wheel. The other on my heart. I look around. Turn the radio down. He says. "Baby, is somethin' wrong?. I say. "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song". And he says. Our song is the slammin' screen door. Sneakin' out late. Tappin' on your window. When we're on the phone. And you talk real slow. 'Cause it's late. And your mama don't know. Our song is the way you laugh. The first date. "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have". And when I got home. 'fore I said "Amen". Askin' God if he. Could play it again. I was walkin' up. The front porch steps. After everything that day. Had gone all wrong. Or been trampled on. And lost. And thrown away. Got to the hallway. Well on my way. To my lovin' bed. I almost didn't notice. All the roses. And the note that said. Our song is the slammin' screen door. Sneakin' out late. Tappin' on your window. When we're on the phone. And you talk real slow. 'Cause it's late. And your mama don't know. Our song is the way you laugh. The first date. "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have". And when I got home. 'fore I said "Amen". Askin' God if he could play it again. I've heard every album. Listened to the radio. Waited for something. To come along. That was as good as our song. 'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door. Sneakin' out late. Tappin' on his window. When we're on the phone. And he talks real slow. 'Cause it's late. And his mama don't know. Our song is the way he laughs. The first date. "Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have". And when I got home. before I said "Amen". Askin' God if he. Could play it again. Play it again. I was ridin' shotgun. With my hair undone. In the front seat of his car. I grabbed a pen. And an old napkin. And I wrote down our songYou caught my teardrops. In your eyelid. You gave me strength. To say hello. You found me. Stranded on your island. It felt. Like I was coming home. And I know. That you're going places. Take a look. I'm right behind. Chorus:. Love is you.

He's on his own again. Rock chick of the century. Is acting like she used to be. Dancing like there's no-one there. Before she ever seemed to care. Now she wouldn't dare. It's so rock and roll to be alone. And they'll meet one day, far away. And say "I wish I was something more". And they'll meet one day, far away. And say "I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before". Mrs Black and White. She's never seen a shade of grey. Always something on her mind,. Every single day. But now she's lost her way. And where does she go from here. Mr Multicultural. Sees all that one could see. He's living proof of someone. Very different to me. But now he wants to be free,. Free so he can see. And they'll meet one day, far away. And say "I wish I was something more". And they'll meet one day, far away. And say "I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before". He'll say "I wish I knew you, I wish I met you when time was still on my side". She'll say "I wish I knew you, I wish I loved you before I was his bride". And so they must depart. Too many more broken hearts. But I've seen that all before. In TV, books and film and more. And there's a happy ending. Every single day. And they'll meet one day, far away. And say "I wish I was something more". And they'll meet one day, far away. And say "I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"Shut up and let me go. This hurts I tell you so.

If ten million fireflies. Lit up the world as I fell asleep. 'Cause they'd fill the open air. And leave teardrops everywhere. You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare. I'd like to make myself believe. That planet Earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep. 'Cause everything is never as it seems. 'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs. From ten thousand lightning bugs. As they tried to teach me how to dance. A foxtrot above my head. A sock hop beneath my bed. A disco ball is just hanging by a thread. I'd like to make myself believe. That planet Earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep. 'Cause everything is never as it seems. (When I fall asleep). Leave my door open just a crack. (Please take me away from here). 'Cause I feel like such an insomniac. (Please take me away from here). Why do I tire of counting sheep?. (Please take me away from here). When I'm far too tired to fall asleep. To ten million fireflies. I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes. I got misty eyes as they said farewell. But I'll know where several are. If my dreams get real bizarre. 'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar. I'd like to make myself believe. That planet Earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep. 'Cause everything is never as it seems. (When I fall asleep). I'd like to make myself believe. That planet Earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep. 'Cause everything is never as it seems. (When I fall asleep). I'd like to make myself believe. That planet Earth turns slowly.

I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air. See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns. See you make your way through the crowd. And say "Hello", little did I know.... That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles. And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet". And I was crying on the staircase. Begging you "Please don't go", & I said.... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run. You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". So I sneak out to the garden to see you. We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew. So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while. 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter. And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet". But you were everything to me. I was begging you "Please don't go", & I said.... Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run. You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel. This love is difficult but it's real. Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". .... I got tired of waiting. Wondering if you were ever coming around. My faith in you was fading. When I met you on the outskirts of town. And I said.... Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone. I keep waiting for you but you never come. Is this in my head? I don't know what to think. He knelt to the ground & pulled out a ring & said. Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone. I love you & that's all I really know. I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress. It's a love story baby, just say "Yes". Oh oh oh. 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you1, 2, 3. Not only you and me. Got one eighty degrees.

There's a she wolf in disguise. Coming out, coming out, coming out. A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me. Darling it is no joke, this is lycanthropy. The moon's awake now with eyes wide open. My body's craving, so feed the hungry. I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday. Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it. I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office. So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover. And tell you all about it. There's a she wolf in your closet. Open up and set her free. There's a she wolf in your closet. Let it out so it can breathe. Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey. It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way. Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent. The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student. To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar. And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later. Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys that just want to enjoy. But having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy. There's a she wolf in the closet. Open up and set her free. There's a she wolf in your closet. Let it out so it can breathe.

She's going off about something that you said. 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.. I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.. I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.. And she'll never know your story like I do. But she wears short skirts. I wear t-shirt¶. She's cheer captain¶. And I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find. That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.. If you could see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So, why can't you see. You belong with me. You belong with me?. Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans. I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.. Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself. "Hey, isn't this easy?". And you've got a smile. That can light up this whole town. I haven't seen it in awhile. Since she brought you down.. You say you're fine—I know you better than that. Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?. She wears high heels. I wear sneakers. She's cheer captain¶. And I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find. That what you're looking for has been here the whole time. If you could see. That I'm the one. Who understands you. Been here all along. So, why can't you see. You belong with me?. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.. All this time how could you not know, baby?. You belong with me. You belong with me. Oh, I remember you driving to my house. In the middle of the night. I'm the one who makes you laugh. When you know you're 'bout to cry. I know your favorite songs. And you tell me about your dreams. Think I know where you belong. Think I know it's with me. Can't you se that I'm the one. Who understands you?. Been here all along. So, why can't you see. You belong with me?. Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.. All this time how could you not know, baby?. You belong with me. You belong with me. You belong with me. Have you ever thought just maybe. You belong with me?. You belong with meI can almost see it. That dream I'm dreaming, but. There's a voice inside my head saying. You'll never reach it. Every step I'm taking. Every move I make feels. Lost with no direction. My faith is shaking. But I, I gotta keep trying. Gotta keep my head held high. There's always gonna be another mountain. I'm always gonna wanna make it move. Always gonna be an uphill battle. Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose. Ain't about how fast I get there. Ain't about what's waiting on the other side. It's the climb. The struggles I'm facing. The chances I'm taking. Sometimes might knock me down, but. No, I'm not breaking. I may not know it. But these are the moments that. I'm gonna remember most, yeah. Just gotta keep going. And I, I gotta be strong. Just keep pushing on, 'cause. There's always gonna be another mountain. I'm always gonna wanna make it move. Always gonna be an uphill battle. Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose. Ain't about how fast I get there. Ain't about what's waiting on the other side. It's the climb. Yeah. There's always gonna be another mountain. I'm always gonna wanna make it move. Always gonna be an uphill battle. Sometimes you're gonna have to lose. Ain't about how fast I get there. Ain't about what's waiting on the other side. It's the climb. Yeah, yeah. Keep on moving, keep climbing. Keep the faith, baby. It's all about, it's all about the climb. Keep your faith, keep your faith. WhoaIn the night, I hear 'em talk,. The coldest story ever told.

Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus. Kiss my butt, lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts. It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks. It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed. Bitches lust, man they love me when I'm laying the cut. Missed the cut, the lady give a eighty some paper cut. Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought. Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce. If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time.

Pick up where we left off and get smashed again. I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz. Driving around with a smashed front end. Let's cash that one in. Grab another one from out the stable. The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado. The hell if I know. Do I want leather seats or vinyl?. Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision. Or Maico beats quake like Waco. Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though. So crack a bottle, let your body waddle. Don't act like a snobby model. You just hit the lotto.

What a day, one day and your Jesus really died for me. I guess Jesus really tried for me. Bodies in the Bodhi Tree, bodies making chemistry. Bodies on my family, bodies in the way of me.

And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve. So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean. Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes. Give me reason to fill this hole, connect the space between. Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divide. There was nothing in sight but memories left abandoned. There was nowhere to hide, the ashes fell like snow. And the ground caved in between where we were standing. And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve. So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean. Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes across this new divide. In every loss, in every lie, in every truth that you'd deny. And each regret and each goodbye was a mistake too great to hide. And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve. So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean. Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes. Give me reason to fill this hole, connect the space between. Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divide. Across this new divide, across this new divideI'm not surprised. Not everything lasts. I've broken my heart so many times. I stopped keeping track. Talk myself in. I talk myself out.

Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind. And try to take the path less traveled by. That first step you take is the longest stride. If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late. Could you say goodbye to yesterday?. Would you live each moment like your last. Leave old pictures in the past?. Donate every dime you had, if today was your last day?. What if, what if, if today was your last day?. Against the grain should be a way of life. What's worth the price is always worth the fight. Every second counts 'cause there's no second try. So live like you're never living twice. Don't take the free ride in your own life. If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late. Could you say goodbye to yesterday?. Would you live each moment like your last?. Leave old pictures in the past?. Donate every dime you had?. And would you call those friends you never see?. Reminisce old memories?. Would you forgive your enemies?. And would you find that one you're dreaming of?. Swear up and down to God above. That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?. If today was your last day. Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?. You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars. Regardless of who you are. So do whatever it takes. 'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life. Let nothing stand in your way. 'Cause the hands of time are never on your side. If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late. Could you say goodbye to yesterday?. Would you live each moment like your last?. Leave old pictures in the past?. Donate every dime you had?. And would you call those friends you never see?. Reminisce old memories?. Would you forgive your enemies?. And would you find that one you're dreaming of. Swear up and down to God above. That you'd finally fall in love if today was your last day?Jason Mraz. We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things. Lucky. Do you hear me,. I'm talking to you. Across the water across the deep blue ocean.

The PR transmissions will resume. They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down. And hope that we will never see the truth around. (so come on). Another promise, another seed. Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed. And all the green belts wrapped around our minds. And endless red tape to keep the truth confined. (so come on). They will not force us. They will stop degrading us. They will not control us. We will be victorious. (so come on). Interchanging mind control. Come, let the revolution take its toll. If you could flick the switch and open your third eye. You'd see that we should never be afraid to die. (so come on). Rise up and take the power back. It's time the fat cats had a heart attack. You know that their time's coming to an end. We have to unify and watch our flag ascend. (so come on). They will not force us. They will stop degrading us. They will not control us.

We are the people that rule the world. A force running in every boy and girl. All rejoicing in the world. Take me now, we can try. We lived an adventure. Love in the Summer.
